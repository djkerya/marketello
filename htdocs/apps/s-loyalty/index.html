I log in today, 6/1/16, and I see new updates and available options to further customize our store. We have also recently changed our store theme but due to some errors had to switch it back. We contacted them on a very early Saturday morning, while also contacting an extremely expensive review system that runs thousands of dollars. S Loyalty, beat the socks off of them with responding and completing the necessary installation we needed before we even knew any1 had a chance. In other words, these guys offer it all and it looks good. By the way are using the business edition or professional edition (don't have the names in front of me).</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great app, great support</span>

The app is simple and straightforward to use - not only on the back end, but for customer use as well. (The rewards "tab" that is visible while shopping is genius, without being intrusive graphically on your site.) Creating unique rewards is good for us, and being able to change them every few weeks keeps our customers coming back to see what they can earn next. The customer service has been amazing, and above and beyond expectations. I emailed to ask a question, and not only received a prompt and polite response, but also a follow-up email letting me know that changes were being implemented to better address the concern I had! I had tried a couple of other apps before finally settling with S Loyalty, and I know I made the right decision.</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Features + Looks + Support =  Winning Combination!</span>

We believe it was the best program for our size business especially when comparing costs.  However, we were not 100% initially sold.  The primary reason was the limited methods to customize or theme the program to our site without having to get into higher costs.  We did look at another program that recently came out and while nice, we would be losing some of the features S Loyalty offered.</p><p>While our final decision was still to be made, we just happened to discover that Sloyalty introduced their upgrade with the new theming feature....SOLD!  The ability to customize the overlays, add an icon and more now makes this the best  loyalty program app available for Bigcommerce. Combined with their prompt tech support, we can now provide a quality loyalty program to our customers and at a price thats hard to beat. &nbsp;Thanks Sara!</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">A solid loyalty program for BigCommerce stores</span>

With Refer-a-Friend and Fan Builder,&nbsp;you'll be getting customers by word-of-mouth; one of the best means of advertising. And of course the flagship tool is Loyalty Program, where you decide how you want to reward your customers when they make a purchase.

                        </div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body"><p>We'd been looking for an app that would allow us to reward our customers via a points system. S Loyalty plugged right into our BC store and I was able to get it set up within 30 mins. It's pretty easy to use and I believe the monthly cost of the app is worth it as our customers are happy their orders (past and current) can be counted towards their points total and everyone loves a freebie! One thing I wish it did was exclude those who have opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, unfortunately there will have been a few of our customers who received an email when they had previously opted out (you have the option to send a Welcome email to your customers with an account, informing them of their points balance). Overall a good app that I would recommend!</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Phenomenal App</span>

I'm never left wondering how to find something within the control panel. We also love the idea of 'gamifying' our rewards program to offer incentives to 'level up' our customers. Although I've only used it for a short time I feel it will more than pay for itself in the long-term by helping us retain all the customers we're putting so much effort into acquiring. Definitely recommend you check it out!</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Excellent App</span>

On top of those new people being rewarded a few bucks off their first purchase.Free advertising that is paid only after the purchase.

We were told to try S Loyalty as an alternative. S Loyalty is extremely rigid in the features they offer, you are not able to customize the program to fit your store's needs. For example, we wanted to offer 01 point for every $10 dollars so, when a customer spends $100 dollars they are awarded 10 points which translates to $10 dollars. The S Loyalty Team finally let us know this wasn't an option and they were unable to help us make these changes. We were also not able to change the time period the email is sent out, which was important to us since our original program in Volusion was set up to reward our customers by the 7th day after an order had shipped versus the 2 weeks S Loyalty requires. During the free trial we were under the impression we could choose the &nbsp;$19.95 plan however, when our free trial was up this option was no longer available due to the amount of customers we have. The cheapest plan available to us started at $69.95. This price is not warranted for the service or features available in this application. &nbsp;On the other hand, we did like a few of the features S Loyalty offered such as being able to rename your points, the automatic emails the program sent customers and the customization available on the built in widget. However, this was not enough to keep us interested in S Loyalty and we have chosen to explore other options.</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">So far so good.</span>

The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price. We'll have to wait and see it adds real value for money at $19.99 per month but the store is still growing and I think loyalty programmes are good anyway. I had very good feedback from my customers who are looking forward to saving points for a big purchase. I had to contact S Loyatly support only once (just a question, not a fault) and they replied very promptly. I hope that the developper will add more features in the future such as the ability to choose wether points are given based on prices with or without tax (at the moment it's only without tax). All in all, I'm very pleased but time will tell if it's really useful for me and my customers.</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">So far so good</span>

There is no way to make any changes to this. &nbsp;I have had moderate success on my first website with Fan Builder but it is far from optimized in building a database. &nbsp;Another problem is that each promo code has no expiry date so after 3 weeks of use I have over 4000 promo codes in my database and there is NO WAY my staff could determine which to delete. &nbsp;In another month I will have 10,000 promo codes in my database with no expiry date and no way on knowing which ones can be purged. &nbsp;In 12 months I will have 100,000 promo codes, 90,000 of which will be junk ... you get the point.</p><p>After 5 days, SLoyalty has no solution on a fix in getting it going on my second site. &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;Five days and you cant figure this out? &nbsp;</p><p>If you have a small website with smaller traffic, this app my work but if you have volume like my sites have, you will go crazy and you will not be able to install it on a second site. &nbsp;Your pop up will look generic and cheesy and you will have a flood of promo codes that will wreck havoc on your promo code data base. &nbsp;I could go on but this app is far from excellent. &nbsp;Like I say, small operators will love this. &nbsp;I write code and my websites are very well traffic'd so I demand a customized look. &nbsp;</p><p>A rating of 2 is a little high ... 1.5 is my actual rating as it does have merit for smaller website operators who do not have internal coding. &nbsp;I do not recommed SLoyalty as there are much better solutions.</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Good App</span>

This is a great way to automate things with follow up emails about people's reward points that they've earned, as it notifies them when they've earned enough points to go to your website.  It also obviously promotes social media growth and awareness as well.</p><p>The only thing holding this app back from a 5 start in my estimation is after someone has purchased a product -- giving the customer the option to post the image associated with individual product (that links to that specific product) they purchased and not just a link to the general store on their facebook account.&nbsp; That would take this app to a whole new level, I think.&nbsp; However, other than that, this is a well thought out app that can bring a lot of punch to your online sales.

As your business grows, you know time becomes the most valued commodity.  I think this program aids you tremendously in automating (1) follow up emails with prospective customers and notifies them when they have enough points to redeem so as to turn that emailed person into a customer (most likely), and (2) the creation of coupon codes in BigCommerce is automated.  Overall, great app to spend 15 minutes implementing to see if it will work for you.

If I had to make a recommendation on a great improvement for the suite would be that after an order was placed, the landing page for the customer to share that he/she just purchased would enable them to share the product image(s) in the store (and not just a link to the store in general with a general store icon) to their facebook page, etc.  So, it would notify their friends that they bought "x" product (with the icon of that product or multiple products if they so chose) and then the link to that specific page.  In addition to its other features, that would make this app a 10 star app.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great Rewards Solution for E-commerce</span>

After the trial, we signed up, but there comes the bad surprise. Our bigcommerce store is already a couple years old and therefore we have 2000+ customers that have created accounts with us. We assumed that we could sign up for the lowest price setting ($19.95) on sloyalty as we didn't apply any rewards points towards those previous accounts, only new accounts would receive points. It wouldn't let us though, we had to sign up for the next price level ($49.95) just because we have over 500 customers already. Not happy with it. I emailed them regarding this issue, but haven't heard back about it as of yet (48 hours later). </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Pretty Good</span>

Quick to get going had a couple customers entered right off the bat. Like that it is easy to get into. Downfall is that you have no control over where the icon goes and how visible it is or what it looks like. Can't really run multiple more complex rewards, the options are pretty simple. Have s-loyalty branding on everything unless you upgrade to the entrepreneur level.  Also don't like at all that all customers in your store count on your customer count, not just the ones that are participating in the program. Otherwise, simple solution that will work while I am building my store or until Sweet Tooth is compatible with Big Commerce.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Love it!!!!!</span>

The free trial was very swiftly upgraded to a paid plan and...here we are!

For the non-technical amongst us, you'll be delighted to hear that setup and integration is an absolute breeze, and the control panel and interface sLoyalty provide is simple and straight-forward - sensible defaults, clear explanations, yeah, you couldn't hope for better. I whizzed through it at 2AM, fuzzy-eyed, when pulling an all-nighter working on my store and...I didn't break anything! That's got to be a good sign!

The MOST important bit though - my customers love it! Near 100% uptake on it, and i've even had customers choosing loyalty points instead of straight store-credit following some CS enquiries.

In short, it's pretty much a 'set & forget' solution that more or less installs itself and then....just works. I think the basic plan is very reasonably priced for everything it offers and, on top of that, the customer service has been great - responses are swift, polite and human.

Can't wait to find out what the team have coming up for us next!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Powerful Results!</span>

Also love the feature for getting friends to refer friends and the loyalty program was super easy to install.  This is a no-brainer for us. Our old customers were shocked by our awesomeness for giving them reward points for past sales.  I am optimistic about this years revenue.

I think pro version 49.99 is needed for almost everybody. (included welcome points and existing customer import)
19.99 version is kind of so basic.

anyway it is the only solution I found in bigcommerce i can use rewarding point system for customers.

They don't have an FAQ and no phone number to call to ask questions - so, you're left to fend for yourself unless you want to wait for a day to have a very brief email sent to you.  When I clicked on 'import' to check out how you can import old orders and customer lists and find out what file formats they accept, it automatically imported what was already in Big Commerce which isn't necessarily what I wanted.  (I wanted to add customers that we had prior to using Big Commerce.)  This now brought me to a $49.00 per month charge just to import a few customers.  I think this is VERY steep because it's a one time import process that should take minutes, if not seconds and doesn't support a significantly higher per month charge. They also have their advertisements all over the place - throughout welcome emails to the customer (two mentions of their company per email) and several other things.  Sorry, but if I'm paying for this service, regardless if it's a basic or premium plan, then I shouldn't be paying to have THEIR company advertised to MY customers.  If you don't want their advertisements, then you have to purchase the premium plan.  Personally, I'm not happy with the product, nor the customer service and having to wait 24 hours for an answer with no FAQs, all while providing them with free advertising to my customer database.  I will look around for other loyalty reward apps.

I felt comfortable trying them out after reading about their history on Shopify and so far everything has worked great.  I actually like how rewards are redeemed as discount codes instead of store credit because that works better with our finance software.  The app was easy to install and is easy to use.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because if you want to use the past orders import you have to import your store's entire past history instead of perhaps, the last month.  I hear this feature is coming soon though so future users will be able to have that capability.

Signup was quick and easy with no credit card required. I hadn't been using the software more then a half hour before i decided that this was definitely something we wanted to keep and I immediately upgraded.  If you want to import past orders it does require you to have the Pro or Enterprise plan, but we found it worth the upgrade - and my customers really appreciated it. I would like to see future upgrades make more then 5 rewards at some point as well as being able to manually assign points for things like signing up for newsletters, contests, etc. All around a great app - give it a try!</div></div></div></div></div></div><footer role="contentinfo" class="footer"><div class="footer-nav"><div class="footer-nav-column footer-nav-column--large"><h4 class="footer-nav-heading"><a href="/sell/" title="Sell Online"class="footer-links-link ">Sell Online</a></h4><ul class="footer-links"><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/features/" title="Features"class="footer-links-link ">Features</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/pricing/" title="Pricing"class="footer-links-link ">Pricing</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/showcase/" title="Ecommerce Stores"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Stores</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/enterprise-ecommerce-solution/" title="Enterprise Ecommerce"class="footer-links-link ">Enterprise Ecommerce</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/shopping-cart/" title="Shopping Cart"class="footer-links-link ">Shopping Cart</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/best-ecommerce-website-design/" title="Ecommerce Design"target="_blank"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Design</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/amazon/" title="Sell on Amazon"class="footer-links-link ">Sell on Amazon</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-solutions/" title="Ecommerce Solution"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Solution</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/facebook/" title="Sell on Facebook"class="footer-links-link ">Sell on Facebook</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/secure-web-hosting/" title="Ecommerce Hosting"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Hosting</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/omni-channel-software/pos-integrations/" title="POS"class="footer-links-link ">POS</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/ecommerce-api/" title="Ecommerce API"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce API</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/b2b-ecommerce-platform/" title="B2B Ecommerce"class="footer-links-link ">B2B Ecommerce</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-website/" title="Ecommerce Website"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Website</a></li></ul></div><!--//Footer Column --><div class="footer-nav-column footer-nav-column--large"><h4 class="footer-nav-heading"><a href="/resources/" title="Resources"class="footer-links-link ">Resources</a></h4><ul class="footer-links"><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/" title="Apps &amp;
