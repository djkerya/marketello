They all do roughly the same thing. All of these multi-channel apps have the ability to become more and more in-depth and advanced. It's almost limitless. 

Sellbrite also seems to keep adding more features on a regular basis. They're not sitting still. They're becoming more robust. For example, they said they were going to add the ability to sync with international Ebay and Amazon sites - and now it's there. There are a few more features I'm hoping they add (such as automated category-placement mapping).

I think that's it. If you're serious about syncing up your channels, there isn't a better option out there. Sellbrite is the best.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">On Boarding With Ease</span>

We found setting things up with our existing channels to be one of the slickest we've ever seen.

We planned for a separate shipping app but found that SellBrite built in shipping works just fine for our needs.

The On Boarding follow up support was one of the things I did not expect and scheduling follow up support further builds my confidence in working with Sellbrite.   

Pros: Ease of use, great support, works as promised.
Cons: Does not post products for eBay Automotive part sellers.  Will still manage eBay inventory.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">BUYER&#039;S REMORSE, BEWARE!</span>

We purchased the month subscription to sellbrite to test out their system vs their competitor's, and unfortunately we were pretty disappointed. If I could give lower then a 1 star, I would. 

The customer service is extremely slow in answering back to our issues. We opened up a good hand full of tickets throughout our month to request help on different issues, each time it took many days/ up to 1-2 weeks to get a fixable solution. As a result, we lost so many days during our month subscription waiting for an answer.

Some things to consider with sellbrite:

- Works with Etsy somewhat. When building your listings over they will link with your bigcommerce inventory temporarily, and eventually all of our THOUSANDS of items became unlinked. Their support team first informed us that it was our fault everything unlinked. After I corrected them stating we did nothing, they informed me to manually connect back thousands of products/variations,  great solution. Now we have to figure out which categories/items have been submitted to Etsy and which have not.

- When creating items over to Etsy, we had duplicate items created.

- When creating items over to Etsy, ALL of our product descriptions somehow got HTML coding pasted into them by the sellbrite system. I currently have employees cleaning up our descriptions.

- The sellbrite system does NOT support tagging your products on Etsy

- The sellbrite system does NOT support Amazon listing creation. Meaning if you own your own brand on Amazon, you will not be able to create any listings not already in the Amazon catalog. Pretty much useless.

- The sellbrite system does NOT support ANY item creation in Newegg or Rakuten, I mean ZERO. 

- The sellbrite system does NOT support ANYTHING in Walmart "yet"

- The sellbrite system has numerous bugs while creating a listing. For example, apparently our inventory on an item was "zero", but when you check the inventory manager page it was at 100. As a result, the item would not publish over. 

Basically, sellbrite has a lot of issues that we have experienced. It was not a smooth month at all, and the support was extremely slow. Nothing was done about all of the loss of time we experienced from their system and customer support, although I was told by their support team I would be contacted by her manager, which big surprise never happened. As a result of the lack of communication, slow customer service, and a system lacking in many crucial features  I immediately have cancelled our subscription and we will not be coming back to sellbrite. 

I urge everyone to consider other options before wasting hundreds of dollars or more on this service.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Sellbrite Multichannel software</span>

                        </div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">The excellent customer service and quick response time helped me get the program synced and running faster than I'd hoped. Sellbrite is an excellent multi-channel inventory management partner for my eBay, Amazon and Big Commerce stores. The interface is very easy to learn and use, plus did I mention the outstanding customer service?

There are aspects of the system which are not available at this time: variation listing on Etsy, creating new listings on Amazon, and no integration with Jet.com. They've indicated it's on their radar, and I'm sure they will be adding those features in the near future.

Despite those set backs, this software has really helped me "clean house" and take my next big steps with confidence. I've been able to quickly pull existing information from all my old, out-dated listings and quickly build better listings across channels. I instantly saw sales as I moved to Etsy, and I've been able to manage and plan for my growth. If you haven't already, try the free trial and see what Sellbrite can do for your business. I'd recommend taking the trial period seriously; upload as much as you can, play around with difficult variations, and really test the system's adaptability to situations that are unique to your business or product line. Their team will quickly take action on any issues that may come up.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Easy and willing to work with the customer</span>

Sellbrite is the easiest, most friendly, most powerful, not one of the best, but the best program for multi-channel inventory sync.</p><p>We are an Amazon FBA based seller with thousands of SKUs. It's always a headache to oversell cross BC and other marketplaces. Sellbrite already put us at ease even before their FBA support comes online (in a few weeks). We can upload FBA inventory via CSV file and sync with BC within 15 minute.&nbsp;</p><p>Sellbrite also saved us lots of time to create new products directly for FBA listings. Almost everything piece of information is automatically passed to BC, as long as you select a category for the product. Other special features, such as activate Google Shopping or adding a Youtube video, can only be done in BC's platform.</p><p>Once FBA support is live, we are looking for the best two features:&nbsp;</p><p>(1) auto-import inventory a few time a day from Amazon;</p><p>(2) auto-fulfill orders from eBay, BC, buy.com, Sears.com, etc. with Amazon FBA.</p><p>Thanks to Mike and Brian, great job!!!</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Best Inventory Management We&#039;ve Used</span>

While this is a review of Sellbrite, I think it's important to say that all of the other services we tried were unnecessarily complicated or very slow to load, and they came with additional features that we simply didn't need.  My impression of a lot of the other services is that they are trying to be an all-in-one solution and to add value to customers by offering unrelated features, but the downside of this is that something is lost when the focus is spread so thin.  
</p><p>So about Sellbrite, it's easy to use and it works!  I realize the simplicity of this statement but if you go try Linnworks--save yourself some heartache and don't do it--you will quickly realize the value of Sellbrite.  It's quick, easy, intuitive, and it's designed with the user in mind.  It just makes sense AND it's even visually-appealing, which is truly a plus.  It does what it's made to do and in a way that makes sense.  I know that I've said this twice already but this really is a must for an inventory management tool.  Our staff has easily adapted to batch updating inventory via Excel files that are a one-click upload as well as manually updating quantities individually.  Without much of a learning curve, we were able to start using Sellbrite with ease.  The Sellbrite team is also very accessible with an in-app contact feature that is very cool.  Oh, and the reports are also great--very useful for when we place orders to replenish stock.  We are saving countless hours of productivity every week, thanks to Sellbrite, and it is truly a game changer for us to be able to focus on more meaningful tasks.  So far, so good.  Thanks a million (perhaps even literally), Sellbrite! &nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great service / great product</span>

You'll be up and running within an hour! I've been using Sellbrite since the middle of last year and continue to be impressed. It does a very good job managing our inventory on Amazon, eBay and Big Commerce and adding listings to eBay is pretty easy. I'd like more (Amazon repricing, Yahoo Stores support and the ability to update inventory from any platform to name a few), but it's a pretty darn good product that is getting better all the time. And their customer service (provided by company founders) is extremely fast.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">The best multichannel lister</span>

This turned out to be a perfect solution for me.</p><p><strong>Easy to export a csv file from SellBrite and import to BigCommerce.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I posted a few items to eBay from Amazon that had been sitting for a few months that sold quickly on eBay recouping the cost for the system in less then a week.

It could use a few more features such as adding the total retail value of each channel next to the total product count and maybe showing any return requests on the dashboard. If they add a print shipping labels option on the orders page (which i'm told is in the works), this app is killer.
