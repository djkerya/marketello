We currently have 3 Bigcommerce stores running in Ordoro and we sell some of the same items on all 3 sites... Ordoro keeps up with the inventory and keeps all 3 websites synced on the front end and the back end. Sangram is very very helpful... of all the different programs and software we use.... Sangram has the best customer service and is super fast in assisting us as we continue to implement more of Ordoro's features to work for our business. We have finally found a multi-channel inventory control system that actually works!  

For shipping it is about the same as other programs we have used.... but that is a good thing because there is hardly any learning curve at all to start easily processing shipments. We use USPS and UPS and it works great.

The Purchase Order section is really helpful... allows us to easily re-order items we are out of, receive the inventory when it arrives, automatically updates all 3 of our bigcommerce stores with the re-stock items, and lets us know if there are any orders that can now ship that were waiting on that particular order to arrive.

Looks like we will be a long time customer of Ordoro!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Very nice </span>

I highly recommend ordoro especially because of their very quick support, which we all know is necessary to run a good business and when questions arise we need quick answers. They are knowledgeable and straight to the point.

We are designing, developing, manufacturing and marketing specialized products for the auto racing market.  We knew we had to become deeply involved in online sales.  It was the first venture for Dave, my partner, and I into the online sales world.  Initially, we setup our store with another entity . . . . . and quickly found out they were NOT everything they advertised to be!  We had to cut our losses and get established with another entity quickly as our first product launch was rapidly approaching; and, we had to be ready to accept and ship orders.  Enter Big Commerce and Ordoro.  It has been a pleasure to work with these organizations.  Ordoro has made the shipping processing about as easy as I think it can be.  I'm still learning all the capabilities they offer.  I am very pleased with their service - whenever I fat-finger things and muck up the process, they are always there and able to get me back on track.  These opportunities are also used to tutor me further on their system so that I can use it to even greater advantage.  And, best of all, they listen to suggestions from users who may have thoughts or ideas on how to add or improve features!

                                                            by <strong>Karen Emery</strong></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">We are a small start-up drop ship business and we were stressing over how to manage a large group of drop ship suppliers with our limited resources.  We can tell already this app is going to be an incredible benefit to our business by managing the way suppliers receive our orders.  It was easy to import all of our product information into Ordoro from Bigcommerce, and then it was just an matter of setting up a simple fill-in-the-blank form for each supplier and linking the supplier to specific items.  Ordoro will automatically import new orders from Bigcommerce and then we can go in and work with the order...send it to the drop shipper as is or manually work with it if it needs special handling.  You can still add notes with instructions or comments, or you can just literally push a button and the order goes right to the supplier.  The great thing is if an order comes in with multiple items from multiple drop shippers, Ordoro splits it all out and sends each item to it's own supplier.  Once you've been notified by the supplier the order has shipped, you can simply take the tracking number, enter it into the order, and your customer receives an email notification.  Unfortunately we have one large supplier that insists on all orders being entered into their own website's order system which is definitely inconvenient, but that's OK because Ordoro gives you the option to choose how to deal with each item on an order individually.  This app is going to save us all a lot of time.  It's not difficult to set-up Ordoro and link it to Bigcommerce, and we also have to mention that customer service was exceptionally patient and helpful with what were probably pretty basic rookie questions from non-technical people!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Love Ordoro</span>

The two things I would need to see before giving it a 5 star review would be making international label printing better as well as the ability to print 2 domestic shipping labels on one sheet of paper.

All in all, the product/service has been far better than any other shipping solution that Big Commerce has to offer.  I won't name names, but another shipping solution available on here did not even return any of my emails. </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Ordoro is a breeze!</span>

That is a good problem to have to solve but one of our concerns was interfacing all of the information between BigCommerce and Ordoro.  I sent a list of detailed questions to Ordoro customer support.  They quickly offered to set up a call to go over each question in detail.  The entire process was extremely helpful and convenient. They provided me an appointment scheduler to let me choose when we were both available. They sent me a GoToMeeting notice that allowed me to enter it into my calendar.

It has worked flawlessly for us over the years and provides direct support for all major shipping carriers.  Ordoro plays an important role in the daily operation of the online portion of our businesses. It downloads our orders and makes it easy to create shipping labels, manage customers and emails, and seamlessly updates the online status of each order. When we have run into a problem or have had a question regarding the use of the software this is where Ordoro excels above all others, the customer service/support is second to none it is probably the only company I have called were they actually talk to you when you call the first time and actually are willing to answer your questions and fix any problem you may have. If you are looking for a feature rich, robust Inventory Management and Shipping Software than look no further because you have just found it. Take your e-commerce to the next level and get Ordoro. We did and we could not be happier.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great customer service and tech support</span>

I am also an IT person's worst nightmare.  During my trial with Ordoro, I found it was not intuitive for me and wasn't sure how to get around and coordinate with Big Commerce.  After emails with "support" at Ordoro and then follow up emails and phone calls with Kristen at Ordoro, I will say their support and follow up is outstanding.  There were a few bugs that I pointed out, and the Ordoro team and Kristen followed up on them in a few short weeks. A few they took care of in the same day !  I am truly impressed with the Ordoro team and their ability to listen to customer comments, suggestions and then to make changes.  </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Some Good, Some Bad...</span>

• Incredible Customer Service, helpful staff
• Feature Rich, especially for Drop Ship Integration
• Looks really clean and is straight forward

The Bad:
• USPS integration (pricing, labels) only available at added expense ($16-$35) through 3rd party.
• USPS integration was sloppy and confusing, and lacked continuity. Ordoro might look great but their USPS partner has awful customer service, doesn't explain the features of their own tiered pricing structure, and was one of the biggest reasons I left Ordoro.
• You cannot delete any order once synced with your BG store.
• You cannot delete your account (As far as I can tell/have tried)</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Easy to implement, use with multiple channels</span>

Being new to e-commerce, order fulfillment and shipping was a big unknown.  Fortunately for us, we found Ordoro and all our worries went away.  The system itself is extremely easy to use and we love that it interfaces with our drop shippers too.  Also, unlike many other shipping/inventory services, you can actually pick up the phone and call them to ask any questions about the system.  Naruby is always so helpful and her level of customer service is off the charts.  She answered every question I had and was always eager to help.  If you are looking an easy way to manage your inventory, fulfill your orders and the ability to get great customer service with a simple phone call, the choice is clear!  </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject"></span>

Before using Ordoro we would spend at least half the day entering orders into UPS.com and USPS.com, not to mention the giant headache of preparing customs forms. Those long days of drudgery are over, thanks to Ordoro!  It is an amazing, complete order and inventory management system. It has many features that are so handy like the ability to flag orders with custom color coded flags so you can see what is going on at a glance. That is just one of the countless features! It hooks up seamlessly with our BigCommerce site and you can make updates to products and inventory and it keeps track of everything!  One feature I especially love: Ordoro keeps track of multiple shipments for orders that have items coming from different warehouses!  It even automatically uploads tracking numbers to your BigCommerce site, amazing!  I must also sing the praises of their superb customer service team. They are very friendly, personable and professional and will spend one to one time to get you set up and answer any questions you may have.
These days we are spending a lot of time sitting by the pool thanks to Ordoro!

Inventory system works seamlessly, PO orders are a breeze and shipping integration is  great choice for Mac users.  Ordoro has definitely increased the efficiency  of our office.

I am hoping for eBay integration soon as well as Amazon Fulfilled Network (AFN) options.  The lack of these two shopping cart integrations is the only reason for 4 stars not 5.

Integrates nicely with BigCommerce and Interspire stores for easy label creation. Ordoro saves us several hours each month that would otherwise be spent typing in customer name and info into UPS and USPS sites for creating shipments. Not only does it save us this time, but we no longer have user-error address mistakes. Jagath at the company has been very helpful with any questions and requests we have made.

Overall we're very pleased with Ordoro, which we've been using for 9 months now. Only giving it 4 stars primarily for price, which is not very competitive with other services out there. Also, we would like to see better tracking number syncing between Ordoro and the shopping cart (this is not necessarily their fault, but a feature in need of improvement nonetheless).</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject"></span>
