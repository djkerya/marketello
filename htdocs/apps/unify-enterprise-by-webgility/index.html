-  Setup was fairly straight forward - followed some generic youtube videos and stumbled through it.
It would be nice if they could make a direct step by step how to explaining how it links everything together but I got it working for awhile.  Not worth the $$$ setup fee they have available that is for sure!

- First time it worked great and I was really happy until I found out...

-  Post to store can change old orders and cause emails confirmation to be sent out for orders placed months prior - when you post to store.  Make sure all orders in your store are marked as shipped not completed!  Atleast thats what I think the issue was.

-  Second Time I used it did not remember the mapped products (even though I specifically remember making sure I had it checked to save because I seen it in one of the videos), some of the mapped products are now highlighted in red.  Not sure what that means?

-  Third time I went to use the software it popped up an error searching for a file on the hard drive when posting to quickbooks.  Sent help a message about it and a few other complaints - they never addressed the issue.

- Forth time I tried to get everything working again tonight and now it won't even connect to my store.  I haven't changed any settings between when I set it up and now!  Not sure why it says my user name/token is no longer valid.

ECC had some local executable application that would attempt to sync with your ecommerce platform. This doubled and erased inventory - I would oversell constantly and it cost us thousands of dollars in lost time, customer retention and hours lost. The tech support would ignore our basic problems - The overseas development simply is not in touch with basic eccommerce and how it functions. 

Look if you have 20 products then this may work for you as you cna have a birds eye view if you have problems. However we have over 500 items and are on our way to doing almost 3 million in sales. 

top shelf inventory management works.   softcookies also works for a mid size business a few hundred orders a month at most.

Stay away from this application it will fool you into thinking that it actually works and it will fail and you may or may not be able to recover your business. </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Would like to try but</span>

Response from Webgility: Hi Mark.  We were experiencing technical issues with our chat and phone connectivity. I looked up your account but could not find any support tickets.  Since you’re in the U.K. the best method is to submit a help request on our Help Desk at https://help.webgility.com, and our Support team will get on top of it as soon as possible.  </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Software is Frustrating</span>

When it doesn't work, I found myself spending hours of precious time on the phone with tech support, letting them remote access our system and not really finding the issue.  Tech support is very friendly but I can't say I'm a big fan of the software.  I'm honestly looking at alternative applications.  Mostly for me, the issue has been and continues to be the software doesn't download all the orders from my site; very frustrating to still be manually keying in orders when I've paid for the software to do just that.

That being said, the posts here that are two years old are correct.  The software was dependable then, but since there have been too many things added to it causing the issues.

Response from Webgility: Hi Dave.  Depending on how you configure eCC Desktop with your Bigcommerce store, there might be a lag in downloading orders into the software.  I wasn’t able to find information about your account.  Can you contact me at hello@webgility.com so we can get this issue resolved as soon as possible?

It is definitely a time saver and helps eliminate data entry errors for orders, even if you only use it for posting orders to Quickbooks and don't also use the integrated shipping function.  We've had to contact support on a few questions including the "how do I" questions and they were very responsive, knowledgeable, and respectful.  The program runs a bit slow so I recommend using the Scheduler which does a lot of tasks automatically in the background.   Also, you can't run it on a server if you want to have multiple people accessing it.  Perhaps our situation is unque- we use Remote Desktop Server clients to access an offsite server on which our QB and ECC is installed.  We wanted multiple users to be able to access ECC on that machine at the same time as they can with programs like Outlook and QB.  The developers tell us this is not possible so that's been a problem for us.  But overall, we think the value for price paid is very good and we appreciate how complex it is to develop a program like this.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great product</span>

                                                            by <strong>Brian</strong></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">After hours (and I mean HOURS) of research I turned to ECC in conjunction with BigCommerce to modernize my inventory tracking and ease my workload by reducing manual invoicing for my products. Prior to ECC I was operating in the dinosaur age using manual methods of hand counting and reconciling on a monthly basis. With product walking out the door for sampling, constant order pulling and office usage I knew it was time to begin using modern methods to reduce human error. I first looked into a scanning system and decided that, along with ECC and BigCommerce, was the route I would take. I came from a GoDaddy shopping cart, which is simple, but just didn't meet the automation I needed (furthermore, when I asked GoDaddy they refused to even direct me to an ECC-like program so they lost my business). 

These days I have an almost 100% automated system of inventory tracking and invoicing. When a customer orders product on my BigCommerce shopping cart an invoice is automatically generated in my QuickBooks and paid via credit card. This deducts the product from my inventory and keeps my numbers accurate. Furthermore, I use an invoice verification system that downloads invoices to my scanning device which notifies my employees and I if we are pulling the correct product to ship. 

After the order is processed all I do is go into each specific invoice in QuickBooks and click "Ship" to send the coffee to the customer and I'm done!

Thanks ECC, you're a dream come true!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great When It Works</span>

Webgility is really great and helpful when it works correctly, but there are some strange "glitchy" things that happen every so often, making me second guess if all the information is properly synced at times.  Tech support is all in India, and most service reps are competent, though a little hard to understand at times.  The learning curve for the program has been hard for me and the tutorials are not very thorough for specific business settings.  However, we will still use ECC because I can do it alone and there is not another program that seems to interface with QB and our BC platform as well as ECC does.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">pretty good</span>

Now I just have to check daily to make sure that it pulled down data and that it was posted into Quick Books and to call the accounting department and ask how everything looks. Other than that I don't have to do anything other than updating products and prices on the bigcommerce webpage and just making sure everything is running smooth.

I was told by their sales people that Webgility could sync my inventory between two BigCommerce sites and Quickbooks POS. Instead their software completely ruined the inventory I had in BigCommerce. We had to manually inventory thousands of products.

QuickBooks POS was useless, because Webgility could not figure out how to show our retail price. Instead all our products were selling for cost price (hard to make a profit this way).

Customer service is horrible. They will ignore you.

Do not allow Webgility to have access to your Bigcommerce site - you have been warned.

Response from Webgility: QuickBooks POS does not support the complex product options that are offered with Bigcommerce. We have a dedicated support team for Bigcommerce customers, and we strive to provide excellent services. As this isn’t a typical use case, it took us a while to figure that out, and we apologize for the inconveniences.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Eh</span>

I should preface this by saying I have more specialized needs, so if you do not have these needs the solution is probably great.  WIth regards to the QB integration, it works great.  My issues are with my store integration - specifically when my customers send items to more than one address in the same order.  Currently, eCC does not have a way to import multiple shipping addresses in to their system, so we are forced to use another third party solution (ShipWorks) to do our shipping.  Strike one.  The next issue is many of our customers, especially during the holidays, send gifts to friends/families/colleagues and they want to include a special gift message.  Our store allows for a gift message to be added, but the messages are not imported in to eCC, so again, we are forced to backtrack to our store admin site and print out the cards.  We recently got a custom feature added, though, and it works just okay, barely.  Bottom line is no third party solution is perfect for everyone, so depending on how robust your needs are this may or may not be perfect for you.  All I can say is be sure to ask the questions if you are in doubt.

Response from Webgility: eCC Desktop’s core features are integrating your online store with QuickBooks, but we’re also building out our shipping features. Your requests are added to the roadmap.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject"></span>

You can setup B.C., eBay, Amazon, and other shopping carts. It works well and they are great about fixing any issues with their software. You really feel like your input matters when you see your suggestion pop up in the next update. There are a few things here and there that need fixed or changed  but they are constantly improving it.

My only gripe is their license fees and their \"Add-on\" packages. The license fees are kind of ridiculous, especially if you get the $50 a month package and have to pay $500. They do occasionally run promotions for no license fees so watch out for those. The add-on packages are not worth the money. I did the $400 package and received a lot less than I expected. You are better off just pestering their support for free whenever you have a question and just hiring an accountant/bookkeeper on Odesk for the Quickbooks portion.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject"></span>
