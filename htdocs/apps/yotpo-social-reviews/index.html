However, assuming that google see's it as a on page content, it's a thumbs up for effectivity.  It is, however, stupid expensive.  The installation instructions can be lacking sometimes.  My only real complaint, is that tech support is really, really slow.  If another company comes along offering similar functionality, with faster support, I would seriously consider switching.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Review</span>

It allows you a lot of customizability, in terms of your email to customers, how it displays on your site, etc. That being said, the price for the app is terribly expensive, and they try to charge you for a full year up front, which is exorbitant. It took a fair amount of negotiating to get them down to quarterly billings, which is still ridiculous. The app costs nearly as much as what I'm paying Bigcommerce's highest package to host my site -- something's wrong with that.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">easy install and quick results</span>

Sure, we all have the tire kickers but I have about 1% of those. After using Yotpo for a year, I can say that there are better ways to spend your marketing dollar and Big Commerce has a free ap for testimonials that got me 90% of the reviews that Yotpo got. There was a slight up tick of reviews, but the main thing they advertise is that you'll be able to push these reviews through your social networks. If you post to your Facebook business page, for example a Yotpo testimonial / review, that content it will only reach 1% of your customers organically without paying for FB advertising. So in order to truly use this ap like they sell you on it, you'd have to pay another several thousand dollars to Facebook on top of what you paid to yotpo. In my opinion that's not smart at all. I'll just use the Big Commerce testimonial ap for free and send them out via paid Facebook ads if needed and actually come out ahead. It's not worth 2k. Maybe worth $10 a month.&nbsp;</p><p>I also contacted and asked how to work around these issues... well it took them several months to contact me to try to help me.. that is not customer service. Poor, very well sold ap.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Too expensive</span>

OK, so let's say you're lucky enough to get 80 orders a month.  Wow.  So it's a bummer that 30 of those won't receive review requests, but oh well.</p><p>Ah...but wait!  That's not how it works!  Those thirty people will still get a review request...next month.  And next month only 20 orders will get their review request.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  </p><p>If Yotpo had an affordable option for entry level, I would absolutely be happy to pay for that.  But I can't afford the entry level, and I do often have more than 50 orders per month.  Small orders.  Not big enough to afford Yotpo.</p><p>So basically they are set up to force you to pay for their service...</p><p>As I said before, if I *could* just load all my reviews into BC's system, I would.</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Works Well But.....</span>

Their system works very efficiently and their support team is awesome. It's a simple to use app and works very well with my website. I would suggest everyone to try this app for 6 months and see the difference. Nowadays every customer wants to read reviews before purchasing. If there are no reviews then many customers are deterred from buying the product.

I contacted Yotpo technical support with an extensive list of questions; within 24h I received a very detailed reply and they graciously offered to install Yotpo for me. Yotpo is now installed in my store; it looks professional and sleek, and has already started generating new reviews.  I am still discovering all the great features of Yotpo, and I especially love the fact that the emails are personalised with the name and surname of my customers.

I have emailed several times and so has my IT department. I have been with them since inception and now they are offering paid features when they were free before. You would think they would want to hang onto existing customers so they right good reviews. No no one at Yotpo cares. They are just greedy. I would continue on and find another review service TRUST ME. STAY AWAY FROM YOTPO!</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Must have app</span>

Having used the default bigcommerce reviews for years, yotpo increased my reviews by 1000%. It is truly superb and excellent support. As premium customer I get access to some really great features that add a lot of content to my site and create a community feel to my business. It is worth every penny. The only downside is the lack of rich snippets support for bigcommerce but this is not yotpo's fault, it's the usual lack of development from bigcommerce's side which is so behind the curve in more ways than one. Still, yotpo makes things that little bit more acceptable.</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Love it</span>

I received very prompt and able help from Yotpo staff to install the app. So far, I have generated a good number of reviews for several of my products. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the emails the system sends out do not display correctly for Outlook users and these users are asked to click on a link to do their reviews. This is an extra step for these users and might be dissuading some from filling out the review. Yotpo should solve this technical issue.

So, unlike BC, customers don't have to click onto your site and scroll down to the review section just to write one. The email makes it less cumbersome so customers can easily write a review and not waste much time during the process.</p><p>However, I still cannot get the program to work with my store properly, possibly because I had some custom work done. So, besides the email feature, I just have a tab on the very right side of my store that allows users to click on to view the review widget. If they don't click on it, my reviews are not located anywhere else! They're not located on product pages - and disabling the BC review code like Yotpo advises - makes it seem like I have no reviews on any products.</p><p>Still trying to get some help from their team so maybe once it works 100% it'll be a 5-star app.</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Website only up for 4 months...over 80 Five Star Reviews....Thanks Yotpo</span>

(I'll happily pay for it if I &nbsp;manage to get more than 100 reviews a month). &nbsp;I'm no HTML guy, so they had to help (i.e. do) me with some of the integration, and it took a few emails to finally crack it, but the support was good, and patient. &nbsp;</p><p>It certainly drive more (validated) reviews than the native BC system, and it's really easy to share the good reviews via Twitter, which just helps me generate a bit of a social presence as well. &nbsp;It's just me here, so I need apps that make my life easier, and this is certainly one of those. &nbsp;As for future enhancements, if they could some how create a way to trigger the review request email once the items is delivered (i.e. integrate with one of the other shipping apps to get the delivery notifications), that would be awesome, as there's times when the email goes out before the item arrives (I ship globally, so the time can be anything from a day to 20 days). &nbsp;Failing that, the option to have different time bands based on shipping destination would help too. &nbsp;</p><p>It's a great platform, there's really no reason not to start using it.</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great app!</span>

The support has been great, and the reviews have started really coming in since I installed this. The only downfall I have with this is that their premium version of this software (which allows you to choose to send emails only for shipped items, and you can stop emails from going to specific customers) is $150 a month!! Are you kidding me? I would gladly pay for this service, but that price is just outrageous! It is almost double the cost of my platinum membership for BigCommerce, and they handle much more than just reviews!

I definitely think it's a must-have app for every store. I just wish they would consider lowering their price to something more affordable. </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great Free Product - Paid Has Best Features</span>

They can increase your sales and conversion rate significantly, when I started at my company we had no reviews! i thought it was crazy not to have them, so i decided to look for an app that would do this for me and that was when I found YOTPO! The process was so  easy simple plus if you have any questions they are there to help you. I was up and running in no time and in only 2 weeks I went from 0 reviews to over 150! my sales increase significantly, we are now at almost 500 reviews and growing.

The features and capabilities the app has to offers is beyond doubt incredible, and most of all, it adds such great value and insight to your business which is essential if you want to grow your business.

Within 24 hours after installing this app we started to see reviews roll in which we didn't expect to happen so quickly, whilst reading the reviews with such big smiles on our faces, we couldn't help it but to brag a little by posting the reviews using the Yopto social media connector, it so easy to use that we may have gone a little over board on the first day bragging on facebook, but it was worth it!

Yopto I can't thank you enough for delivering such a fantastic product and for making such a positive difference in our everyday business!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great reviews app</span>

For an app this awesome, it should never have had this crucial SEO tool missing; not in 2013. Come on, Yotpo! Some other (weaker) platforms have the capability but not BigCommerce, why not? If I could have this feature enabled there is no way I would switch from Yotpo. But, at this time, if I find an equally great app, or even one that's a little less great, that offers rich snippets for BigCommerce I will be switching.

However, since we installed Yotpo two weeks ago (a smooth and streamlined process like few applications I know) we have received 10 times the normal amount of reviews! I think the strongest points are:
- invitations to review products are sent automatically and can be nicely customized
- unlike on the standard BigCommerce templates, where customers have to dig in really deeply to find the reviews of the products, now the reviews are highly visible and can be found intuitively on the right of each page
- reviews look more "trustworthy" because reviewers are labelled as "verified" or "buyer"
- the best reviews are automatically posted to your facebook and/or twitter pages in intervals you can set according to your site's needs.

In addition to this there is a brand new coupon reward system, that still needs some work due to the complexity of integrating it with the store coupon system, but we are using it on a trial basis. 

All our support requests have received personalized answers within 24 hours.

Highly recommended product!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great app</span>

My small eccomerce business needed something more than aesthetics, descriptions and SEO to get more traffic and conversions. Our products main benefit is fragrance - Unfortunately something very difficult to convey to potential customers unfamilar with our product via an online medium. Yotpo has brought a level of social trust to the store and our brand. The reviews validating what WE already knew. One suprise was the almost instant influx of reviews after the easy install. I later found out that Yotpo had sent out reviews to customers who had recently transacted with us. It was instant gratification that Yotpo works! The ability to add a small customised message to the review request is great, and the ability the customer has to leave a review simply, without leaving their email client brings it all together. Well done, love it!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Brilliant app</span>

                                                            by <strong>Joey Keirls</strong></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">Hello, I have established my shop around 4 years ago. I am at the pillows and sheets business, based on the US. Business wise, it has always been fine and we enjoyed from the global growth of the ecommerce industry and in particular in the US. More and more people are shifting to buy online. 

The only thing that has dramatically frustrated me along these last four years is the lack of community and user generate content in my website, and it seemed like these are privileges belongs to giants sites only (Amazon, Ebay and so on). 

I then installed Yotpo. 

I read in some reviews that Yotpo guarantee 5-9 percent conversion from shoppers to buyers, meaning that I can have hundreds of reviews per month. I had to try it out. Today I can report back on 6.8 conversion from shoppers to active content creators - reviewers. I have about 150 reviews on my site and reviews are keep piling up. 

Now, telling the truth, I only care about conversion. TRUE conversion, from site visit to payment. Yotpo helped in that too. I can report that products that have more than 10 reviews are 10 times (!!) more likely to be purchased, and that overall conversion in my website jumped from the industry standard (i had slightly higher conversion of about 3.6%) to about 4.1% that's about 15% improvement. 

Really recommended solution.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Amazingly powerful app</span>

It took me literally 8 minutes to install and was easy to customize to match my store. In the first 2 weeks I had over 30 reviews and started to see traffic from Facebook thanks to the shares of the reviews to my page. Some of my customers have even told me that it was thanks to some of the positive reviews on my site that they made purchases.

Thanks Yotpo, you guys are amazing.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Very happy with the results</span>

                            
                                                            by <strong>Andrew</strong></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">The number one thing you need to know about YotPo is that you will see results almost instantly. Their system is MUCH more effective than the built-in option by Bigcommerce. The email that is sent out has an actual form in the body of the email that a customer can fill out to submit their review, which makes it easy and effective at acquiring new reviews.

The best parts of YotPo in my view are:

1) It's FREE.
2) It works! You will be amazed to see the amount of reviews coming in by comparison with the once in a blue moon reviews we were getting through Bigcommerce's built in email request.
3) Despite being free, YotPo offers excellent support.
4) "Verified Buyer" badge

Here are the few drawbacks to their system (and the reason I'm only giving 4 stars):

1) If you are using tabs on the product page, it is difficult to get YotPo reviews onto its own tab.
2) Installing their "Bottom Line" feature across your site can be somewhat challenging if you aren't familiar with HTML and CSS. I've yet to figure out how to display the ratings on the products listed on the category pages.
3) Their reviews don't affect the "Sort by Avg. Review" sort by feature on the category pages.
4) Just like Bigcommerce's built-in option, the reviews are somewhat basic (name, title, review, date), unlike a paid service like PowerReviews that has many more features for their reviews like pros/cons, pictures, ways to sort reviews, etc.
5) The email that customers get is just for one product on the order, so people often review all the items on their order instead even though it's posted to a single product.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Very nice</span>

Top notch execution. 

Biggest disadvantage is that you can't import existing reviews in from Bigcommerce (because BC hasn't made the reviews a reportable table.) 

Currently this system is free for small guys like me, but I think when they finally monetize it you'll be stuck paying a monthly fee. </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">This is a must have app!</span>

So I gave Yotpo a go and I am so glad I did. Yes it was a bit tricky to setup but the staff there were well superb and its working like a dream. AND NO MORE SPAM REVIEWS thank goodness not one single one!!!
So give them a go you will love it you having thing to lose but more to gain.

Works seamlessly with Facebook and Twitter with the option to either manually moderate your reviews and post to Facebook, or set the app to automatically post all reviews.  The only disadvantage is Bigcommerce's inability to export existing reviews and allow customers to see these as testimonials.  However, going forward it gives your customers a professional looking window where they can view reviews of your site and your products.  Support is great too, quick response times and very helpful.  Would highly recommend this to another store owner, 5 stars!!

I was a bit hesitant since there is no way to import the existing Product reviews..and we had so many that it seemed like a shame to lose them, but *Do it Anyway*! You will not regret it! 

Within a few days we already had dozens of reviews for the products, their automated e-mail system is so much better than the integrated one on Bc (sorry guys) because for some reason people really respond to it. They've left us honest, helpful feedback that has helped us tend to our clients in a much better way. 

The social feature is a handy bonus, and frankly I am completely amazed at how exceedingly well Yotpo has performed as a Review management and gathering system...and to think that it is Free, well we could not be more pleased! 

We're fans... and if the Bigcommerce app store used Yotpo, this review would already be posting to BigCommerce's Facebook Fan page ;-) </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Yotpo added a jetpack to our product reviews campaign!</span>

The kicker is that they allow the customer to leave the review without ever leaving the email. This has increased our rate of getting a review by hundreds of percentage points. It integrates easily with Bigcommerce. The only downsides right now are:
1. They email customers any amount of days from when the place an order, not from when the order ships. This leads to issues such as orders that have been canceled still getting the review emails.
2. For some reason orders that are incomplete are still emailed even though the order went through.
3. If we were able to filter orders by Country (US vs Other) so that we could email our domestic customers and International customers a different amount of days after the order is placed.

Overall Yotpo is unbelievable!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Highly recommended</span>

These guys helped me all the way to up and running system within my store. The best part is that the Yotpo solution, takes care for everything for you. It handles the reminder emails that are so important for creating reviews, it publishes reviews to social accounts (such as Facebook and Twitter), and it even takes care of the SEO of the reviews. The last thing to emphasise is their support. There is this guy there, named Dave, he really knows his way around customer service and how you should treat your customers. Nothing but someone to learn from. Thanks for all the help.

They've made some changes to the product recently which suddenly increased dramatically the number of reviews on my site.
I think the best changes they have made is : 1. A review form inside the email sent to the customers, so the can leave the review within the mail. 2. They now allow to leave a review using the email and not only the social account.

Great job guys!!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great Product and Excellent Customer Service</span>

It allows us to collect visitor feedback not only from the customers who register at the store, but also from anybody who can enter by his/her Twitter, Facebook, etc. account. It really is a comfortable tool, because these days nobody takes care to register at a store or forum, whereas everybody has a Twitter or Facebook login to use here. Yotpo allows us to integrate this social aspect into the store. The store in some sense becomes a part of the “social network”. Installation was clear and understandable.
I followed the installation steps at:
https://www.yotpo.com/install
Only one thing need be taken into account. If the store is BIGcommerce store, you need activate the reviews module via the admin area additionally. Nicky at the Yotpo Support support team helped to solve this problem, and now the store is running fine.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great App and even better customer support!</span>

The team is also great. The installation manual was very easy to follow and took about 5 minutes to setup. I had a couple of issues but the YotPo team replied in literally a few hours and had it all fixed.

Greatest feature is that it is 100% FREE.

I recently added this application to my Big Commerce website. Once I set up my account, within a short while after the staff at Yotpo voluntarily looked at my website and alerted me that the widget was not set up properly and gave me instructions to fix this. Great service, I like that someone is watching out for me.
I like the idea of the social media aspect in that the customers review go right on Facebook for all to see.
Once a customer review was posted on my website, I was immediately notified via automatic email by Yotpo. This app works and has helped me to once and for all be done with all the unsolicited spam reviews that I used to get before. No I get real reviews from real people. Way to go. Thanks Yotpo!!!

After reading in many places on how important reviews are, and good they suppose to do to my conversion rates, I decided to put some weight on the problem and to invest some time and effort on integrating a more professional solution. 

After signing up to the service, I installed their widget in no time. I had little problems with integrating all over the shop, but what can I say, Yotpo's splendid support really took a good care of me. After short correspondence I had the system up and running. 

I gave 4 stars, because after all they do consider themselves a self-service, easy to install solution, but I did have some troubles in the process. But important to emphasise, that over all I am very satisfied and will most definitely recommend Yotpo's review system to a friend, as it really took the reviewing experience in my website to a whole new level.

All you have to do is put a line of code in the header and add a couple blocks of code to the product reviews html file. They say to remove the BC review code but I just commented it out instead. The basic plan is completely free and does not require payment information to be on file. The free plan lets your customers publish up to 100 reviews a month and works in one store. The customer just logs in with their Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Foursquare to post a review. This helps put a person behind the review instead of possible spam review. 

The only downside is that you need to have a social media account to post a review, but that is the whole point of Yotpo. The closest alternative is power reviews express but that costs $100 a month and doesn't have any social media interaction. Yotpo is constantly improving so if you are using it and have a suggestion feel free to mention it to them. 

Yotpo is a relatively new startup company with lots of potential. I prefer to support small companies compared to larger corporate businesses because that is usually where the new great ideas come from and your opinion matters. Yotpo is still in the beginning stages but they have great potential to be a game changer.</div></div></div></div></div></div><footer role="contentinfo" class="footer"><div class="footer-nav"><div class="footer-nav-column footer-nav-column--large"><h4 class="footer-nav-heading"><a href="/sell/" title="Sell Online"class="footer-links-link ">Sell Online</a></h4><ul class="footer-links"><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/features/" title="Features"class="footer-links-link ">Features</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/pricing/" title="Pricing"class="footer-links-link ">Pricing</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/showcase/" title="Ecommerce Stores"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Stores</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/enterprise-ecommerce-solution/" title="Enterprise Ecommerce"class="footer-links-link ">Enterprise Ecommerce</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/shopping-cart/" title="Shopping Cart"class="footer-links-link ">Shopping Cart</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/best-ecommerce-website-design/" title="Ecommerce Design"target="_blank"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Design</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/amazon/" title="Sell on Amazon"class="footer-links-link ">Sell on Amazon</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-solutions/" title="Ecommerce Solution"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Solution</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/facebook/" title="Sell on Facebook"class="footer-links-link ">Sell on Facebook</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/secure-web-hosting/" title="Ecommerce Hosting"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Hosting</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/omni-channel-software/pos-integrations/" title="POS"class="footer-links-link ">POS</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/ecommerce-api/" title="Ecommerce API"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce API</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/b2b-ecommerce-platform/" title="B2B Ecommerce"class="footer-links-link ">B2B Ecommerce</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-website/" title="Ecommerce Website"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Website</a></li></ul></div><!--//Footer Column --><div class="footer-nav-column footer-nav-column--large"><h4 class="footer-nav-heading"><a href="/resources/" title="Resources"class="footer-links-link ">Resources</a></h4><ul class="footer-links"><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/" title="Apps &amp;
