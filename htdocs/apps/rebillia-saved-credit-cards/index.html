Because of the nature of products we sell we do have a lot of repeat customers.

Switching to Big Commerce give us great flexibility integrating with advance apps such as Rebillia.
Thanks to Rebillia the checkout process become easier and more convenient for our customer and we believe Rebillia help our online revenue growth since we started to use it 8 months ago.

Many of our customers use mobile devices and it's obvious that they like the convenience of simply clicking to purchase as opposed to reaching for a card and typing in information on a small screen. Rebillia also adds a more sophisticated look to the checkout process which in turn appears to generate greater confidence in our site.  (Customers can add and maintain multiple credit and debit cards.)  The install went very smoothly with no interruption to business and support is simply excellent. We have many repeat buyers and I have no doubt that Rebillia will make purchasing faster and easier for them.  Special kudos to Snir for his truly EXCELLENT customer service!

I am seeing now, after 6 months, increases of +25% in orders, +35% conversion, +15% AOV and +40% REVENUE since installing Rebillia!!.. Worth EVERY DIME! I recommend this app to everyone!

This brilliant solution is something BigCommerce should have made available years ago (at least to the higher-priced packages), and certainly should have included after the recent & outrageous new pricing that resulted in our monthly fee more than quadrupling from $79.95 to $336.00 - without a single added feature. For that much of a monthly expense, features like Rebillia's card retention -and their upcoming recurring billing option- should be included features.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Much needed payment app</span>

This data may not be the most accurate one but since our website didn't launch until July of 2015, we didn't have any exact figure to look at.
Comparing between 05/01~07/27 and 01/01~04/30, we had 42.41% in increase in Revenue and 45.06 decrease in abandoned carts. The reason for the comparison is because we began using Rebillia around end of May.

Review: May 2016
- Easy integration with instructions
- Great customer support (Snir is fantastic and really looks at our account in detail. He has great knowledge and REALLY goes beyond to care for the businesses that's using the app)
- Continuous improvements and updates
- REALLY listens to suggestions

I can't think of any reason NOT to use Rebillia at times when easy and convenient checkout is a MUST for all websites.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">So Much Potential</span>

                        </div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">As an enterprise account and having been with Bigcommerce for 6 years now, this is exactly what is needed to take this platform to the next level.  What Rebillia has built so far and what they have in the queue is what ecommerce companies need in order to compete with giants like Amazon.  This is a very valuable application with a very smart and helpful team of people behind it.  Bigcommerce needs to fully welcome this and allow Rebillia full integration and access so that all improvements can be made.  This application is the start of separating standard platform capabilities from excellent capabilities.  I hope Bigcommerce reads this review and understands how important it is that they give Rebillia the key to the door and in turn this will help all of Bigcommerce customers be more successful selling online and retaining customers.  If you are a customer of Bigcommerce, please voice your support for this application as it will help all of us.

Thank You,

The set-up steps are clear--easy to follow. I had it set-up and humming along in a matter of minutes. The support team may be great, but I didn't need to contact anyone it installed so easily. And it works.
I think what I like best is how seamlessly it integrates with BC. Customers don't have to leave their account on our website to manage this new capability--awesome!
Now if we could just get BigCommerce to create a subscription billing feature; or, maybe a quality group like Rebillia here could create such an app that doesn't require customers to leave our website to make a purchase (like all the other app solutions), all my chopping cart check-out dreams will have come true.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Practically Perfect!

The app works well and I have already had multiple customers thank me and start using it to save credit cards.  This is a game changer and anyone on Bigcommerce needs this.  It is one more step closer to single click checkout which we all know is where things need to go.

                        </div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">Finally! Now there is saved credit card info on BigCommerce!! WooHoo!!

Honestly- The number one pain-point during checkout is having to type in cumbersome cc info.

Rebillia eliminates this pain-point with style! Their seamless solution works on your url with your checkout page. The customer always has a consistent experience on a secure page(no redirects,no popups). 

A major pain-point for Store-Owners is when they have to leave BigCommerce Control Panel, and go to a third-party website to login to their CC processor to Void/Refund a credit card purchase. 

The Rebillia App solves this problem too. It is integrated with BigCommerce through the “Apps” portal, and you can void or refund a credit card within the rebillia app console. This is a huge feature that is truly game-changing for back-end efficiency. 

Lastly- The installation COULDN’T HAVE BEEN EASIER. They have streamlined the process so that a blind monkey could do it. If you can watch a 1minute youtube video of how to configure your auth.net settings, you can do it. 

Additionally- I have spoken with the owner and creator of the app several times. He is extremely helpful and thorough. I am a relatively small-volume customer but he has been very attentive and available while I was researching the app. This guy is genuine and has really filled a gap with Rebillia. Thank you Snir Avidan; every BigCommerce Store Owner thanks you!!

I am not a paid-spokesman. I am not a fake bot. My name is Brandon Raffensperger and My stores are SodaYoda.com and DeskDonkey.com and I use Rebillia on both. I have over 20 apps through BigCommerce and this is the first I have ever reviewed. It is that good!!</div></div></div></div></div></div><footer role="contentinfo" class="footer"><div class="footer-nav"><div class="footer-nav-column footer-nav-column--large"><h4 class="footer-nav-heading"><a href="/sell/" title="Sell Online"class="footer-links-link ">Sell Online</a></h4><ul class="footer-links"><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/features/" title="Features"class="footer-links-link ">Features</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/pricing/" title="Pricing"class="footer-links-link ">Pricing</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/showcase/" title="Ecommerce Stores"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Stores</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="/enterprise-ecommerce-solution/" title="Enterprise Ecommerce"class="footer-links-link ">Enterprise Ecommerce</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/shopping-cart/" title="Shopping Cart"class="footer-links-link ">Shopping Cart</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/best-ecommerce-website-design/" title="Ecommerce Design"target="_blank"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Design</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/amazon/" title="Sell on Amazon"class="footer-links-link ">Sell on Amazon</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-solutions/" title="Ecommerce Solution"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Solution</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/facebook/" title="Sell on Facebook"class="footer-links-link ">Sell on Facebook</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/secure-web-hosting/" title="Ecommerce Hosting"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Hosting</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/omni-channel-software/pos-integrations/" title="POS"class="footer-links-link ">POS</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/ecommerce-api/" title="Ecommerce API"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce API</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/b2b-ecommerce-platform/" title="B2B Ecommerce"class="footer-links-link ">B2B Ecommerce</a></li><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-website/" title="Ecommerce Website"class="footer-links-link ">Ecommerce Website</a></li></ul></div><!--//Footer Column --><div class="footer-nav-column footer-nav-column--large"><h4 class="footer-nav-heading"><a href="/resources/" title="Resources"class="footer-links-link ">Resources</a></h4><ul class="footer-links"><li class="footer-links-item"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/" title="Apps &amp;
