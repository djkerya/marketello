I've found it to be extremely useful, and most importantly, profitable. All I  care about is positive return on my investment and this app definitely pays dividends. It's fairly easy to learn, but there is a lot you can use the app for, so it definitely takes a while to familiarize yourself with the program. And as with any good review, the product must have stellar customer support and LeadDyno does. All around great product and great company.

If I ran into any trouble, chat support was a click away. I had googled several other affiliate programs, and for me it was a no-brainer on who to choose.  The other companies seemed so complicated and would be time consuming, and since this is my first experience with referral marketing, I needed simplicity.  So I chose LeadDyno and couldn't be happier.  As for the price, it was an answer to our small business budget prayers! I highly recommend giving LeadDyno a try, it is a cost effective way to promote my business.  This app practically runs itself which allows me to focus my time and energy on other aspects of running a business.  If I could give this app more than 5 stars I would!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Stop Wasting Your Time and Sign on with LeadDyno Today!</span>

Tracking data is also very easy.  Most pages are customizable to fit your brand and their customer service is top notch.

I've been trying to install this app for the past 2 days. No one answers the Chat feature, which times out and doesn't restart. The pricing is also false. BigCommerce lists the monthly price at $29.00 per month, but the LeadDyno site lists the starter price at $49.99 per month. I've emailed about the discrepancy, but no one has gotten back to me. I'm going to uninstall this app and try somethings else.

Their pre-formatted email and social templates are great and are a great way to earn quality back-links from bloggers and other websites. Highly recommended based on the traffic/price plan you fall into.</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great support and simple setup</span>

LeadDyno has been a life saver (and most of all... a TIME saver)! Every affiliate has their own dashboard and can see their referral traffic and commisions at any time. &nbsp;Managing and paying affiliates has never been easier. We set up the rules/commissions however we want. Also, because of their amazing integration with Big Commerce, we don't even spend time trying to encourage customers to sign up as an affiliate. After initial set up... LeadDyno takes care of the the that automagically. We have more affiliates than ever with a lot less effort. More affiliates = more traffic = more conversions. TOTALLY WORTH IT!&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">It takes a village!</span>

I'm happy to present my affiliate program in way that's impressive to my tribe; using LeadDyno made it easy to set up and keep track of things. I quickly realized that the manual systems were not going to be sufficient. In addition to that, I really love being able to easily see where my referrals come from and how my customers find me. I can also export leads from those who provide their email but don't purchase right away. This has been a key tool for me growing my business and my affiliates appreciate the automation and commissions sent to their PayPal accounts!</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">highly recommeded</span>

One feature we highly appreciate is that all the affiliate links are SEO friendly so in the long run it will help in lifting our SEO rank.Overall we give LeadDyno a huge FIVE STARS ★★★★★, not only because of what the App offers and its flexibility but because the customer service is the best!

The affiliate dashboard is also very flexible so you can make it look very professional and inviting for your affiliates.

After speaking with the internet's leading Affiliate Networks who quoted me between £3k-£5k I searched for cheaper alternatives to do the same job, and was excited to see BigCommerce had a number of affiliate apps that could plug right into my store.&nbsp;After reading numerous reviews I installed LeadDyno and was excited to get started. Although I must be entirely honest, I was a little hesitant when I noticed the pricing structure; as my site is already achieving 10s of thousands of unique visitors per month, meaning I was way beyond the Basic account..&nbsp;So I closed the app and shopped around for alternatives...&nbsp;This is now 5 hours later, and I'm writing this review to save you the bother of doing exactly the same!&nbsp;</p><p>LeadDyno is by far the premium affiliate app for your BigCommerce store.&nbsp;The dashboard is easy to navigate, the site for your affiliates looks professional and stylish without being fussy, and if you're a tracking geek like myself you will love all the different analytics you can view... As a seasoned affiliate, I know what affiliates need from a good program, easy to build links, banner html codes, real time tracking... LeadDyno has it all and more.Equally important to the above is customer service... and theirs is fantastic! I must've messaged (poor) "Jennifer" 5 or 6 times today, and every time within moments she was there to answer my queries and not once did I finish the chat without the answer that I needed.&nbsp;In short, save yourself the bother of shopping around all the other affiliate apps, just get this one installed and you'll save yourself the hours it's just taken me to realise LeadDyno beats the competition in an abundance of ways!&nbsp;Excited to get all my new affiliates on board! Thanks LeadDyno</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Just perfect!</span>

We have lots of needs for wholesale and retail customers. We started looking at offering our Dog rescue groups a way to make money off of the over 50,000 items that we make and have for sale on our site http://www.the-store.com Now the wheels are turning AND by thinking out of the box are pushing the envelope of marketing our buisiness in multiple ways. The visitor logs in the dashboard show where traffic is coming from and where they go on the site (very simplistic and so insightful). This has created extra work since.... people are searching in ways that we never addressed. The visitor tracking insight through the dashboard is worth spending some time on.... and you get so much more! Great tech support from Adam while I was online setting up and dreaming up new features that I want. I am not a review writer but, this was a must! Great job!

                        </div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">I’ve been looking for something like LeadDyno for a while now. I own a clothing brand and we work with many affiliates. Previously we had to do everything manually. Every time someone contacted us wanting to join the scheme or to check to see if they'd had any orders we had to check for them. This took a huge amount time which could have been spend driving sales instead of spending time with individuals who weren't getting much traffic or sales to the website. LeadDyno lets you automate all of this and it allows other people to do the hard work of driving traffic to your website whilst you can sit back and watch the orders flow in.

We've not been using LeadDyno for long, but we have already begun to see the results this application can create! As a small business this is a very cost effective form of promotion and I highly recommend trying the free trial! You only pay commission to affiliates when they generate orders instead of conventional promotion where you have to spend money in the hope of gaining sales. It also increases your rankings in google because so many people are talking about your website!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">So far so good</span>

This is also the only affiliate platform I'm aware of that works seamlessly with big commerce, looked into others previously and didn't have much luck.

                        </div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">I tested out 3 affiliate software programs which integrate with Bigcommerce and LeadDyno is by far the easiest to set up with the most intuitive dashboard design. 

First of all, I didn't have to go through hoops just to try out the free trial version and "validate my subscription" via telephone. Next, the process of setting up the app so that it can track sales from Bigcommerce is easy and literally takes one click. 

Once in, the Dashboard looks great and is not overwhelming..you can set up the basics really quickly such as: add banners, and other content marketing material you wish your affiliates to use, terms & conditions etc... Also, when I had a question, the response was within a few hours via email, from the Founder.

Social media shortcuts are already there as well as the most important feature you want to give your affiliates i.e. the ability to link to specific pages on your website (not just the home page).

I use LeadDyno for my online furniture business and as an ex-affiliate marketer, I can safely say this is the best of the 3 options currently available.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great Affiliate program!</span>
