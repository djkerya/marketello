I feel bad for past me wasting all that time manually entering everything but future me is one happy camper. It took about a month to get everything set up the way I wanted it but it was immediately usable. We have a NAFTA agreement and the fact that you can input all customs info right into the items or create categories that specific customs information will be applied to automatically saves he hours a week. We do not have a compatible scale so we have to put the weight of packages in manually still but other than that one alteration you press the print button and our zebra label printer spits out the correct shipping stickers and your done! Easy to track packages, see shipping exceptions, refund, cancel and even create manual shipments. I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of cutting and pasting order after order into shipping forms. Also, the help you get from SS is amazing. depending on your plan there is e-mail assistance which is quick or live chat help. They also give you a dedicated rep for the first 2 weeks to help you set it all up and walk you through the options SS has to offer. 100% would do again.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Why didn&#039;t I switch from Ordoro sooner?</span>

But, we soon learned that the void process, waiting on refunds, manually making labels and customizing our shipping was either cumbersome or an extra cost. While I was getting some responses back, it just wasn't fast enough. When I even opted to try beta, I got no response back from them. The day we cancelled and switched to ShipStation, I actually got a Twitter notification that Ordoro's site was down. Their integration with Endicia kept on automatically shipping me labels even after both them and I confirmed the setting was off (billing us and then taking a while to refund us for the error). Day one on ship station...cheaper rates for us, WAAAAY more customization for the cost, simplistic software, AMAZING mobile app. This is the way a shipping app is SUPPOSED to be! Great job, ShipStation. Thanks for saving us and sorry we didn't go with y'all in the first place.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">A Must for any eCommerce website</span>

However, if any issues arise, it is EXTREMELY frustrating that you cannot call with a query or to obtain advice about a problem.  You have to either go to "Live Chat" (average wait time 20 minutes for a response!!!) or log a service ticket - which can take at least a day to receive a reply - no one appears willing to call back even when specifically requested - if they have a question, they email you, you have to respond and then await a further lengthy period for any reply.

One suggestion would be to work on the user interface  when processing an international shipment, I've figured out how to use it, but it took me a few tries. The customs information was difficult to input as well as locating the international address.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Time Saver</span>

                        </div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">I've shipped 4000 packages in the last 3 years; it's enough to be annoying when you have to transfer data to services like Stamps.com or deal with PayPal's clunky shipping set up. I got frustrated with Stamps.com platform and after 5 hours with tech support trying to resolve several glitches in their software one of their tech guys recommended ShipStation and WOW: game changer! I was a little bummed at first that I could not print on the same Avery labels I have been using for years, then tried other ones and it still would not print correctly so I threw in the towel and bought a DYMO LabelWriter 4XL and combined with ShipStation I literally save about 25% of my shipping time because it is SO FAST. It has been 2 months and I still look forward to doing shipping because between ShipStation and the DYMO it's amazing how fast the whole process is. Personally I print my invoices from my store then click the ShipStation icon on the left of my store, update orders, then update orders again (explained below), click print and the 3-7 labels are printed by the time I pull the invoices out of my printer. SO FAST and EASY. 

The seamless integration with my ebay store was pretty impressive. I have it set to print all labels, even international on the DYMO 4x6 that requires no ink and labels are less than Avery I have been buying so over all I am saving money; however, I can print my ebay packing slip to my laser printer which I like better than using the DYMO labels stuffed into the box. Stamps.com would not let me print international on labels. For first class to residential I have not had any issues with over 20 international packages in the last 2 months since using ShipStation to 7 different countries. 

There are definitely some things that could use a little attention like having to click multiple buttons to get new orders to show up in orders. You click update all stores; it pops up a window telling you that you have new orders, but doesn't bother to populate them IN the new orders tab so you have to click refresh there again.  Like stamps.com it has an auto fetch option but it lags behind so you still have to click multiple times just to see your orders. 

Overall it is the single best productivity tool I have found for shipping and has literally changed my attitude towards shipping. I never EVER would have purchased the DYMO if not for ShipStation and I THANK ShipStation in my head 6 days a week for nudging me to do it. Saving money, saving time and nicer labels than Avery by a country mile.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Wow!

After a little over a month of using SS I'm very glad we made the switch. The gold membership is perfect for us because we ship through three marketplaces and can also process orders manually. We don't ship enough to qualify for commercial plus pricing through USPS so the fact that ShipStation offers ExpressOne saves us a considerable amount of money. Also, rather than sorting through three different marketplaces I can just visit ShipStation to see all of the orders. Bulk printing packing slips and shipping labels has cut my printing time in half at least. I've had one problem with ShipStation a few weeks ago in which it did not notify Amazon that I had shipped a few orders which I actually did but that has only happened once so it might have been a fluke. One thing I'd like to see ShipStation add is the expedited shipping being highlighted in the sidebar just like the multiple quantities for orders is. I've received great customer service even during the trial period. If you're considering&nbsp;ShipStation at all at least give it a shot. -Fastway Safety</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Excellent app!</span>

We used to have to create our Fedex shipping labels in the Fedex Ship Manager, the DHL labels on dhl.com and the USPS labels on usps.com. We always had delays creating labels for DHL and USPS shipments because they had to be entered manually. Since we switched to ShipStation, we can simply select from the dropdown the service we want to use, and even compare rates before printing the labels! Additionally, we can now print packing slips along with the labels straight from ShipStation, saving us yet another step (we used to have to do that in QuickBooks.) After the labels are generated, BigCommerce and Ebay are automatically updated and our customers receive a nice email letting them know the package is on its way. Love it!</p><p>I would only suggest creating an upload functionality for customer data, so we can easily create labels for orders we receive through other offline channels and introducing a direct integration with QuickBooks.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for a great app, it has helped us improve our shipping process!&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Fast smooth and easy setup</span>

The interesting thing is that they are also slightly cheaper on their rates than most, and Express1 and Stamps.com are slightly more affordable than Endicia.&nbsp;</p><p>We ship international and domestic daily, and Shipstation handles it all on every level of detail and of course reports tracking back to my store to update customers. You can customize the column layouts in their orders page, and use the preview panel on the right to very quickly get a label going and order shipped. Using the "Calc" link in the preview panel pops up all setup shipping services and quotes them instantly with travel times quoted based on ship to address.</p><p>It works with several USB scales (Windows and Mac) and also lets you choose which label type goes to which printer with almost no effort once you install the Syncstation software. Their support team was on the phone with me almost immediately to help me set it all up, and stayed on the line while I made labels and asked for help to customize a few things.</p><p>The ability to sort by order status (like "Awaiting Shipment") rocks also.</p><p>I am amazed at the function, and can assure you that every other web based software lacks the full feature sets it has...I have tried them all and canceled some within minutes and some after a day (but it was always once I discovered they could not operate as in depth as we need).</p><p>Finally, shipping from the cloud and loving it.

Update May 2016: Even better, Shipstation now has an after delivery email program that automatically alerts the customer that the package has been delivered. This has been proven helpful already with small items being in a customer's mailbox and they didn't realize it yet. We are now using with BC, eBay and Reverb selling platforms flawlessly. Also, Stamps.com automatically gives you lower USPS Priority rates now without Express1. Stamps.com also recently acquired Endicia so they are the same company.</p></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Works great!</span>

I was using Paypal's Multiorder Shipping for several years, and what a pain that was. Between constant outages, java errors, and a complete lack of integration back to my store, our shipping process was dreadful. 

Once we started using ShipStation not only were our customers better informed about their shipments but our shipping tasks were cut in half. As a bonus the reporting and dashboard through ShipStation turns out to be better than what we are getting through the store itself. 

We looked at several other solutions for months, but compares!</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Very Nice Shipping Platform - Needs a Couple More Features</span>

                        </div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">Overall, very happy with ShipStation, however, it does some things in a clunky way, and it's missing certain features that should be there for a program of this caliber.

Reporting is probably it's weakest area.  My biggest complaint is the inability to export your costs of shipping while using a filter or tag.  I need to be able to account to clients we ship for what we paid out to ship their orders.  There's no way to do this.  If you are not a fulfillment house, or need to generate reports for customers you ship for, then this won't be a big deal to you.  It's a big deal to us, as Shipworks did this task flawlessly.

One other criticism has to do with not being able to have unlimited log in accounts with the enterprise version.  You have to pay a monthly fee for every user over ten users.  How about being a little less stingy with the number of users Shipstation, lol.  It was nice of them to lower the fee from $10 to $5 per month per extra user, however, still would prefer no additional fee.

I do like that it's a cloud service - no more updates, no more clunky off-site access - it's always available, no matter what pooter I am sitting at.

Support tends to get back to us with a couple of days, which is better than not getting back to you at all, like Shipworks is getting known for.

Setting it all up initially is super simple.  Setting it up to use it the way it should be used takes some time and effort, but it's worth it.  Once you get all your product information in there, you'll be able to setup profiles and processing rules.  It makes bringing a new person into ship really straight forward.

In some ways it has more functionality than Shipworks, in other areas, it's lacking.  Still, totally worth getting.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Excellent product &amp; service</span>

It's obvious power is as a shipping tool, enabling a more efficient procedure for preparing, picking, packing, and shipping orders.

Top all of that off with exceptional support and a willingness to evolve the product, and we're absolutely 5 star happy with ShipStation</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">A No Brainer: If You Do Ecommerce, Get ShipStation NOW!</span>

                        </div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">I sell on Bigcommerce, ebay and Amazon and after using 4 or 5 other shipping software, I can say with 100% certainty that ShipStation is the absolute best. It is honestly a no brainer. ShipStation has drastically improved our workflow, decreased our order processing time by 70%, and saves us a lot of money every month! 

I would recommend watching their videos and spending about a 1 or 2 days to really learn the ins and outs of the software. Once you understand how ShipStation works, you'll know that you can automate about 90% of the shipping process. And the interface is very user friendly. Currently, all we have to do is click 3 buttons and our order processing is done for the day. It literally takes us less than 5 minutes--not even joking. 

Two other features that I love and cannot live without on ShipStation are the search features and the Reports. ShipStation makes it extremely easy to search for any past transaction. Once you do a search, you'll get every single detail you would ever need to know about that transaction right in front of you. ShipStation also allows you to view or download 14 different types of reports, which are all extremely detailed. It blows my mind how convenient this thing is to use. I also give a lot of credit to the developers who have literally thought of everything. They really know what they're doing.

The pricing is very reasonable because you save a lot of time, and with the included Express 1 account, the postage savings pretty much pay for the software. If you compare what they offer to other competitors, you'll know that you're getting a spectacular deal.

I really couldn't be happier with ShipStation. They really have it all covered when it comes to your shipping needs. Trust me...get ShipStation. You won't regret it.

Shipstation is amazing - search,  printing , void , combine orders, return label - everything just perfect.
Their integrations with the marketplaces are working smooth.
I recommend every seller to move on and grow his business like we did and  start working with shipstation.

Let me tell you, it most certainly is. If you are managing more than one selling outlet (like we are) this app is a life saver. Not only does it cover the basics like shipping (duh!) but it also gives you such a concise and clear view of your entire operation that you'll wonder how you've ever managed without it. Within a few days we ditched our stamps.com account and switched to the paid service. </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Save time and money</span>

We also have an Etsy store in addition to the BigCommerce store and orders for both are seamlessly managed in ShipStation. The monthly fee for ShipStation is made up by the extra money we save from shipping using the discounted shipping rates. I love the look I get from people standing in line at the post office when I go in with my box of orders, drop them off, and leave. Oh, and support has been great so far. A rep from ShipStation called me as soon as I first signed up for the trial to discuss the process. Their online documentation pretty much takes care of it all, but if there are any other problems they are quick to address it. If I had one complaint it would be the price going from one platform to two. $20 extra seems a little much. But aside from that it's money well spent.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Not working with Big Commerce right now - Service is Very Slow</span>

Everything was fine until 1/14/14 when suddenly Ship Station could not download our Big Commerce orders. Order from our other two channels are still coming just fine. We contacted Ship Station and Big Commerce support to find out what was causing the error. Our guess is it was due to the "upgrade" BC did around the same time. Don't you love it when BC does and "upgrade" and it breaks your store!

In any event, here we are two days later and Ship Station still does not work with BC and we have not heard from their support people. Of course the BC support folks haven't even responded to our support ticket yet.

I think Ship Station is a great product when it works. When it doesn't work, forget about getting quick solutions or even a response to your problem. That is pretty much how I feel about Big Commerce as well. They have a lot of great features, lack some very basic ones our other shopping carts offer, but service is non-existent. </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Love it.</span>

                                                            by <strong>Anna</strong></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">I had been using OrderCup and decided to give ShipStation a try because I found out that they offer the ability to print pick lists - which is something that I really wanted to be able to do in order to save time. ShipStation's customer service has been great too. When I first signed up, they took the initiative to contact me to offer help with getting set up, and I have contacted them a few times since then to ask questions and have gotten quick responses. Their support forms and guides are extensive and much better than the ones that OrderCup had (some of which weren't even accurate), but there is just so much information there that I end up emailing support to get answers to my specific questions. I used to have issues with OrderCup where they wouldn't fetch orders some times, and I do not have that problem with SS. Only FedEx and Canada Post are available carriers to me though - offering UPS, DHL, and/or Purolator would be very beneficial. I have found their prices to be better than FedEx.I think UPS might be available for Americans, but it is not an option for me here in Canada. All in all, I feel that there are some important features missing, but they do have a feature request page which I have added to, and I have received such good service that I wouldn't be surprised if the features were eventually available.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Greatly Improved our Order Flow</span>

It organizes all of our orders in a place other than our main frame sales website, which is convenient for us for reconciliation and accounting purposes. It handles all of our packing slip and label printing with ease. 

Ship Station also has great customer service, and they walk you through any problems or questions you have. I would definitely recommend it to any eCommerce business person looking for a simple shipping solution.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Fantastic!</span>

                            
                                                            by <strong>Yoav Perry</strong></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">I have been looking for a while for an integrated shipping service and this is perfect. Not only does it work with my FedEx and UPS accounts but it also gives me discounted rates on USPS with Express One.  I used to pay a monthly fee Endicia account to be able to mail with USPS but Endicia is integrated here free of charge so I cancelled my paid account with them.  (Endicia amongs other things enables me to ship online first class or parcel post which you can't do with the USPS web site or with PayPal shipping).  

With the Ship Station platform I get notices and calculations of shipping whenever an order arrives. I can also use PayPal without my online store to charge a customer and the order will go into Ship Station as well.  There are lots of small details here that save me time and money and makes shipping feels as if I have a logistics department working for me. For example, when two orders arrive from a single customer, the system asks me if I want to consolidate them into a single shipping; nice!  I can print stealth postage so no one sees my discounted rates, I can select different types of shipping labels to be used with my laser printer or my thermal printer. The system enables me to put customers' UPS or FedEx account if I have a customer that want to charge the shipping to their own account.  I can map any shipping service name from my website to be a specific class of service.  I can also use this to print put packing list or invoice and it even imports the product images from my site to put next to the item on the printed list (customized, you can turn this option off).  As a "bonus" it also gives you some interesting stats about your sales trends and history on the front page. Another nice touch. the system can also ship in bulk which is really helpful if you got lots of shipments to send at once or already have the labels loaded into the printer and want to print all at once.  If you don't want to print them all right away, you can make a PDF out of them to print later - how nice is that?  When you send a package, it attaches the tracking number of the package automatically to the order on your BigCommerce site so customers can track it - you don't need to do anything. It's all automated magic. 

Problems: Yes, there are a few but not significant. Printing the logo on the shipping label is weird and out of place. PayPal integration is clunky - it imports the entire order as one item.  I sometimes get the same order once from PayPal and one from BigCommerce. These are issues with the PayPal API really which are probably not ShipStation's fault but they need to be addressed.  The system may also offer classes of shipping that don't really exist in real life (Ever seen a flat rate first class envelope?) and it needs to be fixed so we can only see applicable shipping classes to the carrier, destination and item that we choose.  My last issue with the system is that sometimes when things don't match and you try to calculate shipping, the error messages are total techno gibberish that doesn't make much sense to me as a user and gives me no idea on how to remedy the situation. I wish that error messages will be fixed to make more sense. Being an advocate for the use is user experience 101...

But other than these few minor things, this system is so great that even with these "to fix" items I still give it 5 stars. I love using it. Saves me tons of time.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great Product and Great Service</span>

Makes our fulfillment process so fast and easy, saving us countless hours a week.  Customer service is great.  They interact by email only but it's included and they always get back within an hour usually less than 30 minutes and are very helpful and understanding.  Besides having a system that is wholly and consistently reliable, having excellent customer service is what takes the cake for me, especially for a Saas.

What's missing for me are a few things: 1) Ability to ship on a customers UPS account.  2) COD by UPS. and 3) Inclusion of Customer Comments & Notes on the Packing Slips & Invoices generated out of Ship Station, which is only included on the top level program.  Some of my orders are not complete without the customer comments & notes on the packing slips and should be included with every level of service, in my opinion.

In any event, they seem to be always improving and these things could and probably will change sooner than later.  Other than those few items, everything else is great.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">I have tried them all and ShipStation gets it!!</span>

They allow me to automate many aspects of my business.  I can set up triggers on how to handle orders as they come into ship station.  One trigger is custom emails that go out with tracking that look like they came from my business and not some shipping program.
