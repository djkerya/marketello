                        </div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">Shipping Easy has been a huge value to our business. It was fairly easy to integrate into our BC store, and they were helpful in getting us set up with our various sales channels and carrier accounts. Their customer service is off the charts! The control panel is user friendly. All orders from sales channels are in one place where we can easily print pick lists, packing slips and shipping labels. Shipping labels have the order number printed on it, which is very helpful in keeping things straight.  You can even create custom shipments so we use Shipping Easy for all our shipping and mailings, not just orders. All customers that have supplied an email address are immediately notified with tracking info. You can even split orders into multiple shipments as needed. For USPS they partner with Endicia, who also has great customer service. With the savings on postage, Shipping Easy pretty much pays for itself.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">VERY HAPPY!</span>

The customer service has been great and the software works great with our needs.  We had been using Stoneedge Order manager for years and had to manually update our big commerce order status one order at a time because that information was never linked.  When I found out Shippingeasy automatically updated the order status in bigcommerce it was a game changer for us.  It has enabled us to cut down on the amount of time we were spending shipping to focus on other areas of our business.  I enjoy working with what seems to be a smaller company because they work hard for your business and roll out new features on a regular basis.  I would give six stars for Shippingeasy if I could.  </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Fast and Easy.

Our account is seamlessly integrated with our website and multiple online marketplaces, cutting the time spent on processing shipments down by more than half. Allowing us much more time to spend catering to our own customers as they do for us. The customer service that we receive is outstanding and the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful, answering our questions in a matter of moments. Running an online store can leave you feeling overwhelmed, but ShippingEasy compares shipping providers and rates to make sure that we are always receiving the right kind of shipment at the lowest price possible.

So many times companies work on updates that we don't want! We just hear the word update and we cringe as business owners. However, Shipping Easy updates are the ones we actually need. Since our last review 8 months ago, they now manage ALL of our eCommerce platforms; Big Commerce, Amazon and now Etsy too! It took me all of 15 seconds, seriously, 15 seconds to integrate Shipping Easy with Etsy. We look forward to continue working with them ;-)

The software is intuitive and easy to use. It saves us time every day, but the better rates on many of our shipments also leaves us with a net savings on shipping every month. We only use USPS, we get good savings on Parcel and Priority, and especially express mail, we saved about nine bucks on one shipment recently. I recommend trying it for a few months and then crunching the numbers. </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Awesome Service!</span>

That makes it pointless because if I wanted to do priority/expressing I could still do that on Paypal or even the USPS website at a discounted rate (ex: 1.69 for 3oz package on Paypal vs. $2.75 if I went to the post office-- but I don't even care about getting a discounted rate I just wanted to not have to go the post office so much). And if I wanted Endicia then I would have just gone with Endicia. Whats worst is I read here and other places that they use to offer this for Starter Plans before some upgrade earlier this year that took away all first class options (without a subscription). So I will be cancelling my account.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great Software with Great Customer Service</span>

The shipping app is super user friendly and almost reminds me of a mac based product, very simple to set up your shipping providers.

She was able to explain how everything worked and how I can save time and money. She was totally right on both counts.

I already had an Endicia account and was printing labels from both Endicia and Pay*** depending on where the order came from. With the integration with Bigcommerce, it streamlined it even more since they export the addresses, then post the tracking number back to Bigcommerce once the label is printed. Soooo easy ...

To give you an idea of their customer service level. The day I printed my first label, I realized the label type I had didn't match up with where the label printed. I called the customer service guy who set up my account and within 3 days, they had added my label type as a default. Now if that isn't customer service, I don't know what is. 

I'm not saying there haven't been bumps in the road. But for every problem, they have quickly and graciously jumped on it and solved my issue as fast as they possibly could. I have no plans to sever my relationship with ShippingEasy any time in the future. I'm excited for the plans they have upcoming in the near future and know they are a company worth doing business with.

FYI: If you already have an Endicia account and decide to merge with your ShippingEasy account, make sure the ShippingEasy account rep shoots an email over to Endicia so they can change your account status to "ELS Label Server Customer". If not, Endicia will continue to charge you the monthly rate.

Shipping Easy was sooooo easy it automatically synced to our Big Commerce store and I was creating labels within minutes!
Their customer service is wonderful. They even gave me their direct tech email which is constantly monitored. 
I gave them 5 stars because they deserve it, but there are two updates which I REALLY need. The first is integrating with Amazon Seller Central. The second is a scan sheet for our postal delivery person who has to manually scan each and every package instead of just 1 bar code scan for the entire daily shipment, so I end up driving to the PO myself. Hope to see these updates soon ;-) </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Appropriately Named!</span>

We now breeze through one-hundred order days in a fraction of the time it use to take. I actually had a police officer drop by and ask me if I knew how fast I was going. Can you believe that? In conclusion, this is a great program, there are a few things that need to be changed but there is a very responsive staff behind this godsend and I have already received a hand-full of emails explaining additions and bug fixes that addressed some of the concerns I had.

They listen to all our needs and have implemented many of them in subsequent releases. We especially love how it talks to our Big Commerce store by updating order status, adding tracking numbers and then the big commerce system takes care of the rest by emailing our clients and keeping us on track. Shipping Easy's relationship with postal carriers has saved us money with every transaction. So we are saving time, money and headache because of Big Commerce and Shipping Easy. </div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">A Great tool for Small Business</span>

The training and customer service were excellent. Our team had several questions and these we answered quickly and the resolutions were explained in an easy to understand way.

We are immediately benefiting from considerable time savings, previously we have had to manually enter shipping addresses in to our system. With the 
implementation of Shipping Easy this is unnecessary as is confirming in BC if an item is shipped. The system does this automatically.

We look forward to the roll out of further updates and additional features. We have heard that these are being worked on. The program is MAC compatible
too.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Best Shipping Service after trying Many!!</span>

                                                            by <strong>Dissatisfied Shipping Dude</strong></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">ShippingEasy is very easy to set up and very easy to use, just so long as you don't mind paying extra for shipping.  When you first sign up there are, for example, First Class Mail options available without paying for another service but after a while the only first class mail options require paying a monthly service fee to Encidia or funding an Express1 account (which is another version of Encidia). 

I signed up for Shipping Easy because I wanted to be able to save money and ship First Class Mail packages. When ShippingEasy stopped offering me First Class Mail options I funded an Express1 account only to find that I can't use it to ship First Class either, so now I would have to sign up an pay for an Encidia account for First Class Mail. 

What is more I can save money shipping Priority Mail simply using USPS.com.

BigCommerce accounts for a teeny tiny fraction of our sales; the rest come from other distribution channels so I am finding that ShippingEasy is not worth the hassle for us. However, some sellers may find that paying ShippingEasy and Encidia--not to mention Express1--is worthwhile for the streamlined ease of making labels as long as they don't mind being nickeled and dimed every time they turn around. I realize that they need to make their money somehow but I am not impressed.

Response from ShippingEasy:
We are disappointed that we weren’t transparent enough in terms of the rates that we are able to share with our customers . The introduction of version 2 on April 8th seems to have caused some confusion and we apologize. The rates available through ShippingEasy for USPS are Commercial Base pricing and Commercial Plus pricing – which are granted by USPS to a select group of providers. We work with 2 such providers: Express1 and Endicia. Express 1 tends to have the best rates on all but a few service types (First Class Mail and International Flat rates boxes are two such exceptions) and is included FREE in all ShippingEasy plans. They do not charge us a monthly service fee so we pass on the full discounts to our customers. Endicia, on the other hand, charge us $15.95 per customer for access to their rates. We waive this fee in full for ALL of our paid plans. However, for the Starter account (FREE), we are unable to ignore the hard cost to our business and thus pass this on to accounts not paying for our solution. We do not add any fees to this charge whatsoever and simply facilitate an easy sign up for those customers that require certain services that Endicia specialize in. Many of our customers prefer Priority Mail flat rate and regional rates and thus do not require an Endicia account at all. We offer it for those that will benefit from Endicia’s rates – but unlike our competitors, we do not force it or bundle it. It’s your choice!
 
Again, we’re terribly sorry about the confusion associated with the upgrade.  We’re here to help and will happily work with you to help resolve the issue or recommend a provider that is better suited to your needs.

                                                            by <strong>Shandor Collins</strong></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-body">We started using ShippingEasy about a month ago and WOW what a difference.  I thought that the only way to print our shipping labels was to use the horrid P***al service or Click N Ship.  Integration into BigCommerce was a breeze and also integrating it into Ebay was easier. It is also an added benefit to get emails about updates and improvements to the service.  We now use this for EVERYTHING from International First Class  and Express to Regular USA mail.  The cost is very minimal and the discounts are well worth it if you ship a lot of packages like we do.  I cant wait until they add UPS and FedEx which is right around the corner!  The biggest benefit for us was that we had an old Zebra LP-2844 which was incompatible with Click N Ship and P***al.  But it works flawlessly with Shipping Easy WHOOOO!  

Don't delay any more and for goodness sake don't continue to print and hand tape your labels like we were.  I highly recommend this product (make sure you buy a label printer) for any business that wants professional printed labels with discounted postage.  Very happy so far and I would give it 10 stars if I could.</div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem"><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-rating"><div class="rating"><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span><span class="active"></span></div></div><div class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta"><span class="marketplaceItem-reviewItem-meta-subject">Great Customer Service</span>

So easy to use and very user friendly application. Over the phone they integrated my Bigcommerce store and my shipping process became so easy...They charges 9 dollars, but within two days I got that and more saving by using discounted USPS rates through their website.

I really recommend...no more cut and paste and making mistakes. They saved me a ton of time and money.  Too bad they don't have the Amazon store integration yet. I am waiting for it...

Very good customer support - they called me back promptly when I ran into a problem....
