7 below (Fees and Payment; Upgrade, Downgrade and Cancellation of Services) for
more information regarding termination of this Agreement or related Services.

	<ol><li>The entity or person creating a BigCommerce account and
designated as the owner will be deemed the account owner. For security reasons,
only the account owner or the point of contact designated by the account owner
will be allowed to make changes, cancellations, or designate a new point of
contact. Disputes sometimes arise between or among multiple persons claiming
ownership of or rights in a site, store or account. 
		<strong>BigCommerce is not
obligated to, and will not, resolve any such disputes.
		</strong></li><li><span></span>If multiple persons are claiming ownership of or rights in a
site, store or account, and, in BigCommerce's sole judgment, there is
uncertainty as to the ownership of or rights in such site, store or account,
then BigCommerce will, to the extent of its knowledge and ability, notify such
persons of the dispute and demand that such persons promptly, conclusively, and
finally resolve the dispute in a manner which makes clear who the owner(s)
and/or interest holder(s) is/are and in a manner which relieves BigCommerce of
all liability and obligations concerning the dispute and such site, store or
account. If the disputing persons fail to resolve the dispute within what
BigCommerce, in its sole judgment, deems to be a reasonable time, then
BigCommerce, at its sole option and without any obligation to do so, may
suspend or terminate the account until such persons resolve such dispute and
reach certainty regarding ownership of or rights in such website, store and/or
account. The person or persons conclusively and finally determined by court
order, binding arbitration or settlement agreement to be the rightful owner(s)
or interest holder(s) of such website, store and/or account will be obligated
to pay all amounts due and comply with the then current BigCommerce policy
regarding transfers of accounts, if required, to transfer ownership of the
site, store and/or account to the rightful owner. Failure of the rightful owner
of such site, store and/or account to timely pay in full all of such amounts
will be deemed a breach of these Terms and will subject the account to
immediate termination.

Submissions
	<ol><li><strong>Name and Trademarks</strong>. Customer hereby grants BigCommerce a non-exclusive right and license to use Customer’s name and such of Customer’s trade names, trademarks, service marks and logos ("<strong>Customer’s Marks</strong>") as are used by Customer on Customer’s hosted sites in connection with this Agreement, and images and publically-facing information about Customer on Customer’s hosted sites including, but not limited to, screenshots of Customer’s hosted sites and associated photographs appearing on Customer’s hosted sites ("<strong>Customer Public Information and Images</strong>"): (a) on BigCommerce's own websites describing and promoting BigCommerce's Services, (b) in printed and online advertising, publicity, directories, newsletters and updates describing and promoting BigCommerce's Services, and (c) in applications reasonably necessary and ancillary to the foregoing. Customer (i) represents and warrants to BigCommerce that Customer has all necessary rights to grant BigCommerce the foregoing rights, and (ii) agrees that neither Customer nor anyone else will be entitled to any compensation for BigCommerce's exercise of the foregoing rights.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Customer Voluntary Suggestions</strong>. Some of the features of this website or

advice ("
		<strong>Customer Feedback</strong>"), or (b) literary, artistic or other content,

		<strong>Customer Submissions</strong>")
(Customer Feedback together with Customer Submissions, "
		<strong>Customer Voluntary Suggestions</strong>"). By
providing Customer Voluntary Suggestions to BigCommerce via any method (e.g. site submission,
email, survey responses, etc.), Customer represents and warrants to BigCommerce
that (i) Customer has all necessary rights to distribute Customer Voluntary Suggestions via
this website or via the Services found at this website, either because Customer

or because Customer has the appropriate distribution rights, licenses and/or
permissions to use, in writing, from the copyright or other owner of the
Customer Voluntary Suggestions, and (ii) Customer does not violate the rights of any third
party by providing the Customer Voluntary Suggestions.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>License to BigCommerce</strong>. BigCommerce will have the right to
use and disclose any Customer Voluntary Suggestions posted to BigCommerce's corporate
websites or submitted directly to BigCommerce for any lawful purpose. In no
event will Customer or anyone else be entitled to any compensation or
acknowledgement for BigCommerce's use of any Customer Voluntary Suggestions. Customer's
provision of Customer Voluntary Suggestions is entirely voluntary and will not create any
confidentiality obligation for BigCommerce. By submitting Customer Voluntary Suggestions,
Customer hereby grants BigCommerce an irrevocable, perpetual, transferable,
non-exclusive, fully-paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide license (sublicensable
through multiple tiers) to: (a) use, copy, distribute, reproduce, modify,
create derivative works of, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, and
publicly display Customer Voluntary Suggestions (or any modification thereto), in whole or in
part, in any format, medium or application now known or later developed, and (b)
use (and permit others to use) Customer Voluntary Suggestions in any manner and for any
purpose (including, but not limited to, commercial purposes) that BigCommerce
deems appropriate in its sole discretion (including, but not limited to, to
incorporating Customer Voluntary Suggestions (or any modification thereto), in whole or in
part, into any technology, product or service. The provisions in this Section
apply specifically to BigCommerce's use of Customer Voluntary Suggestions posted to
BigCommerce's corporate websites or submitted directly to BigCommerce, and not to Customer’s hosted sites. Customer will be solely responsible for any and all of
the Customer Voluntary Suggestions that are submitted through Customer’s account, and the
consequences of, and requirements for, distributing it.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Discussion Areas</strong>. BigCommerce makes no representations or warranties with
respect to any forums, blogs, private messages, emails, or other electronic
discussion mediums made available on or via the Services (collectively, "
		<strong>Discussion Areas</strong>") or with respect to any messages, information, or materials
contained in the Discussion Areas. Customer's use of, or reliance upon, any
such messages, information, or materials is at Customer's sole risk and
expense. BigCommerce does not, and cannot, review all of the information and
materials provided in the Discussion Areas and has no responsibility or
liability for any such information or materials or their use. If BigCommerce becomes
aware of any information or materials that it determines violate these Terms or
the Discussion Areas' policies promulgated by BigCommerce from time to time or
that BigCommerce otherwise deems inappropriate in its sole discretion,
BigCommerce reserves the right to delete, move, or edit any such information or
materials.
		</li></ol></li><li>Export of Services or Technical Data
	<ol><li>Customer may not remove or export from Australia or the
United States or allow the export or re-export of the Services, or any direct
product thereof, including technical data, in violation of any restrictions,
laws, or regulations of Australia, the United States or any other applicable
country.
		</li></ol></li><li>Fees and Payment; Upgrade, Downgrade and Cancellation of
Services
	<ol><li><strong>Fees</strong>. In consideration of the Services provided, Customer
will pay BigCommerce all fees due according to the prices and terms listed on
this website. BigCommerce reserves the right to modify its pricing and terms at
any time, and such changes or modifications will be posted on this website and
effective immediately upon the next renewal, billing period, upgrade or
downgrade of the Services with and/or without notice to Customer. All payments
are NON-REFUNDABLE.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Taxes</strong>. All fees are exclusive of all federal, state, and/or
other governmental sales, goods and services, value-added, harmonized or other taxes, fees
or charges. Customer shall be responsible for all sales, goods and services, value-added, harmonized or other taxes, fees or charges.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Billing Policies and Cycles</strong>. All billing invoices and
payment notifications will be maintained directly in Customer's Account Portal.
The billing cycle begins on the day Customer converts to a paid store (the "Billing Date") and is due on that day each month, partial year or year
thereafter, depending on the Service plan selected and billing terms for
individual Services. Billing related to the purchase of SSLs or Domains are
billed once these products/services have been purchased by Customer.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Payment</strong>. A valid credit card is required for accounts to
process payment. BigCommerce will automatically charge Customer's credit card
on file based on Customer's billing cycle (monthly, partial yearly or yearly,
depending on the Services selected and billing terms for individual Services)
until Customer validly terminates the Services. Fees for prepaid Services are
based on Services purchased, regardless of actual usage and payments made for
such Services are NON-REFUNDABLE. BIGCOMMERCE DOES NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR
CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL DAYS, MONTHS OR YEARS AND DOES NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS TO
CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT USE THEIR ACCOUNTS OR LOG IN.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Unpaid Accounts</strong>. Unpaid amounts are subject to a late
payment charge of 1.5% per month, or the maximum legal rate allowed by law,
whichever is less. If payment is not received within 30 calendar days of the
billing date, BigCommerce will automatically revoke access to Customer's
account. BigCommerce may or may not contact Customer directly to notify
Customer of its unpaid account. Accounts past due over 90 days will
automatically be deactivated.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Disputed Charges/Billing Inquiries</strong>. It is Customer's
obligation to review all charges for accuracy. Customer has 30 days from the
date of billing to contact BigCommerce and/or dispute the charge. Failure to do
so within the specified time frame will constitute Customer's agreement that
all charges are valid and Customer thereby waives any claims it may have had
regarding such charge.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Upgrades</strong>. Should Customer elect to upgrade its prepaid
Services or if such Services are automatically upgraded pursuant to the last
sentence of this Section 7.7, the Billing Date of the next renewal period will
remain the same; however, Customer will be billed immediately for the pro-rata
portion of the upgraded Services fee for the remainder of the current billing
period. For example, if a month-to-month customer is billed on October 9th for
monthly prepaid Services from October 9th to November 8th, and such Customer’s
account is upgraded effective on October 30th, then such Customer will be
charged immediately for the pro-rata usage of the upgraded plan from October
30th to November 8th. On November 9th such Customer will be charged for the
full monthly fee amount of the upgraded plan.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Downgrades</strong>. Should Customer elect to downgrade its prepaid
Services, the downgrade will take effect on the commencement of the next
renewal period. In other words, BigCommerce DOES NOT provide credits or refunds
on downgrades that are effective during the applicable billing period (whether
such period is a month, quarter or year). For example, if a month-to-month
customer is billed on October 9th for prepaid Services from October 9th to
November 8th and such customer downgrades the prepaid Services effective on
October 30th, then the downgrade will take effect on the next billing date,
i.e. November 9th.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>BigCommerce Analytics</strong>. Payments for the BigCommerce
Analytics Service are made in arrears and are based on Customer's store order
volume. Should Customer add the BigCommerce Analytics Service, Customer will be
billed for that Service on the monthly anniversary of Customer's Billing Date,
regardless of the Service plan selected for Customer's prepaid Services. The
BigCommerce Analytics fees due each month will be calculated based on
Customer's store order volume for the preceding 30 days which will determine
the applicable pricing tier as posted on this website. For example, if
Customer's Billing Date is the 15th of every month and Customer adds BigCommerce
Analytics on June 1, Customer will be billed for BigCommerce Analytics on June
15 based on the applicable pricing tier using Customer’s store’s order volume
for the preceding 30 days with the fee prorated 15 days based on usage.
Thereafter, Customer will be billed for BigCommerce Analytics on the 15th of
every month based on the store's order volume during the preceding 30 days from
the Bill Date.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Cancellations</strong>. BigCommerce Services will continue in effect
until Customer validly terminates the Services.
		<br><br>Customer must notify BigCommerce of its intent to terminate
prepaid Services at least 5 calendar days before the billing renewal date. If
notice is not received before such date, such Services will automatically renew
for the subsequent renewal period. For example, if a month-to-month customer is
billed on October 9th for monthly prepaid Services from October 9th to November
8th and such customer provides a valid notice to terminate its account on
November 6th, Customer will automatically be charged for prepaid Services from
November 9th to December 8th and the prepaid Services will terminate on
December 8th. If the same customer provides notice to terminate its account on
November 4th, then the account will terminate on November 8th and such customer
will not be charged for any further prepaid Services on such account.
		<br><br>Customer may terminate BigCommerce Analytics upon request.
If the termination date is after the Billing Date for the Service, Customer
will be billed for BigCommerce Analytics based on the applicable pricing tier
using the Customer's store’s order volume for the preceding 30 days from the
termination date and prorated based on usage. For example, if Customer's
Billing Date is the 15th of every month and Customer terminates with an
effective date of termination on June 8, Customer's final bill for BigCommerce
Analytics will be calculated based on Customer's store’s order volume for the proceeding
30 days as of the termination date and the applicable tiered pricing will be
pro-rated from May 15 through June 8. If Customer terminates BigCommerce
Analytics prior to the first Billing Date after Customer adds the Service,
Customer's final bill for BigCommerce Analytics will be based on the applicable
pricing tier using Customer's store’s order volume for the preceding 30 days
and prorated for usage.

any person's or entity's intellectual property rights, rights of privacy,
rights of publicity or other personal rights is prohibited. BigCommerce may

Copyright Infringement" below).
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Misrepresentation of Transmission Information</strong>. Forging,
misrepresenting, omitting, or deleting message headers, return mailing
information and/or Internet protocol addresses to conceal or misidentify the
origin of a message is prohibited.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Viruses and Other Destructive Activities</strong>. Use of the
Services for creating or sending Internet viruses, worms or Trojan horses, or
for pinging, flooding or mail bombing, or engaging in denial of service attacks
is prohibited. It is also prohibited for Customer to engage in other activity
that is intended to disrupt or interfere with, or that results in the
disruption of or interference with, the ability of others to effectively use
the Services (or any connected network, system, service or equipment) or
conduct their business over the Internet.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Hacking</strong>. "Hacking" and related activities are prohibited. "Hacking" includes, but is not limited to, the following activities: illegally
or without authorization, accessing computers, accounts or networks,
penetrating or attempting to penetrate security measures, port scans, stealth
scans, and other activities designed to assist in hacking.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Anonymous Proxies</strong>. BigCommerce does not allow the use of
anonymous proxy scripts on its servers. They can be very abusive to the server
resources, affecting all users on that server. Customer will not access or copy
any portion of the Services through any automated viewing, downloading or
crawling systems.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Export Control Violations</strong>. The exportation of encryption
software outside of Australia or the United States and/or violations of
Australian or United States law relating to the exportation of software is
prohibited. Customer may not export or transfer, directly or indirectly, any
regulated product or information to anyone outside Australia or the United
States without complying with all applicable statues, codes, ordinances,
regulations, and rules imposed by Australian and United States federal, state
or local law, or by any other applicable law.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Child Pornography</strong>. The use of the Services to store, post,
display, transmit, sell, advertise or otherwise make available child
pornography is prohibited. BigCommerce is required by law to, and will, notify
law enforcement agencies when it becomes aware of the presence of child pornography
on, or being transmitted through, the Services.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Other Illegal Activities</strong>. The use of the Services to engage
in any activity that is determined by BigCommerce, in its sole and absolute
discretion, to be illegal is prohibited. Such illegal activities include, but
are not limited to, storing, posting, displaying, transmitting, selling or
otherwise making available ponzi or pyramid schemes, fraudulently charging
credit cards or displaying credit card information of third parties without their
consent, and failure to comply with applicable online privacy laws. BigCommerce
will cooperate fully with appropriate law enforcement agencies in connection
with any and all illegal activities occurring on or through the Services.
		</li><li><span></span><strong>Other Activities</strong>. This list of prohibitions provides
examples of prohibited conduct, and is not intended to be a complete or
exclusive list of all prohibitions. Engaging in any activity that, in
BigCommerce's sole and absolute discretion, disrupts, interferes with or is
harmful to (or threatens to disrupt, interfere with, or be harmful to) the
Services, BigCommerce's business, operations, reputation, goodwill, customers
and/or customer relations, or the ability of BigCommerce's customers to
effectively use the Services is prohibited. Such prohibited activities include
making available any program, product or service that is designed to or could
be used to violate these Terms. In addition, the failure of Customer to
cooperate with BigCommerce in correcting or preventing violations of these
Terms by, or that result from the activity of, a customer, patron, subscriber,
invitee, visitor, or guest of Customer constitutes a violation of these Terms
by Customer. Without limiting the rights and remedies available to it,
BigCommerce reserves the right in its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate
Customer's access to its account and the Services, with or without notice, and
to take any other action that BigCommerce determines in its sole discretion is
necessary as a result of any behavior by Customer that is illegal,
inappropriate, disruptive to this website, the Services, or to any other user
of this website or the Services, or which otherwise breaches these Terms.
BigCommerce may report to law enforcement authorities any actions that may be
illegal, and any reports it receives of such conduct. When legally required, or
otherwise in BigCommerce's sole discretion, BigCommerce will cooperate with law
enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal activity conducted
using this website or the Services. These prohibitions do not require
BigCommerce to monitor, police, remove or reject any content, information, graphics, photographs or links on Customer’s hosted sites or any Customer Voluntary Suggestions or other
information submitted by Customer or any other user.
		</li></ol></li><li>Backup Storage
	<ol><li>BigCommerce offers its Services to host ecommerce websites,
not to store data. Using an account as an online storage space for archiving
electronic files is prohibited and will result in termination of Services
without prior notice. For its own operational efficiencies and purposes,
BigCommerce from time to time backs up data on its servers, but is under no
obligation or duty to Customer to do so under these Terms. IT IS SOLELY
CUSTOMER'S DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO SEPARATELY BACKUP CUSTOMER’S FILES AND
DATA WHICH MAY RESIDE ON BIGCOMMERCE SERVERS. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL
BIGCOMMERCE BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR LOSS OF CUSTOMER’S FILES AND/OR DATA ON ANY BIGCOMMERCE SERVER.

modify, make derivative works of and use, each licensed Design Theme solely in
conjunction with the BigCommerce platform and the Services. For clarity, the
foregoing license only allows Customer to use each licensed Design Theme for a
single BigCommerce store/website per license purchased. If Customer desires to
use a Design Theme for more than one BigCommerce store owned or operated by
Customer, a new Design Theme license must be purchased for each such store

			</li><li><span></span>We recommend that data is migrated into a store which is not live (visible to the public and/or transacting).
