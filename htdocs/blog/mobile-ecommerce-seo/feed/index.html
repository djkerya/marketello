		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for such an awesome post, Everett! Fantastic details about everything mobile SEO - And none of it is outdated as of yet:) 

One thing I&#039;d like to add to help the readers is that Bigcommerce plans to offer AMP on new Stencil themes and offers it already for Stencil&#039;s Cornerstone 1.6.x theme as a Beta feature  for those that have opted-in - BigCommerce must specifically enable it. To request to opt into the beta, send an email to Community [at] bigcommerce [dot] com. (STENCIL-2944)

For those looking to speed up their Bigcommerce home page speed but do not have, or do not want to convert design to compatible stencil theme, there&#039;s another solution: Customize current mobile template home page to make it AMP valid or compatible. It can be done at this Bigcommerce partner:

http://www.ecommercewebsite.com/google-amp-on-bigcommerce-mobile-home-page-design-installed/

Use coupon code &quot;25ampoff&quot; for 25% off. Converting the home page to AMP and making it similar to the desktop version of the home page design with images and content will make it look good too.

Thanks again Everett, I thorougly enjoyed reading your knowledge-packed article!]]></description>
