After all, the sure fire sign of a healthy brand is a growing number of repeat purchases from already existing customers.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retention-rate.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21330" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retention-rate.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retention-rate.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retention-rate-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retention-rate-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>The above is a screenshot of BigCommerce’s out-of-the-box ecommerce analytics Customer report. You can clearly see the number of new vs. returning customers. A 50/50 split like the one above is a great place to be for a brand. And you can clearly see this particular brand is heavily focused on increasing returning customer spend. </em></p>
<p class="p1">This is because earn net new customers is expensive. It often takes advertising to acquire –– and if they don’t come back to purchase again, you’re return on ad spend stays steady, rather than increasing over time. It also means your customer lifetime value is low (which decreases how much you will be willing to spend on advertising –– and thus will limit your ad visibility).</p>
<p class="p1">Growing your customer lifetime value and building long term customer loyalty takes time, though. It can’t be created overnight.</p>
<p class="p1">It also isn’t rocket science.</p>
<p class="p1">Earning increased repeat business and building customer lifetime value is doable –– and you can start right now.</p>
<p class="p1">First, know that it takes business investment to make LTV a core and measured metric. It must be part of your overall business strategy. This isn’t about a monetary investment. No, you need to invest time in building ways to track and measure your LTV over time.</p>
<h2 class="p5">How 5 Brands Made Customer Lifetime Value a Business Priority</h2>
<p class="p1">There are many ways to build customer lifetime value, but first, let’s define it to make sure we are all on the same page.</p>
<h3 class="p6">What is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)</h3>
<p class="p1">Customer lifetime value, commonly referred to as LTV or CLV, is a business metric that estimates the total predictable repeat purchase rate of a customer over the lifetime of their time with your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">The higher your brand’s LTV (lifetime value) is, the more valuable it is considered in the market. This is because acquiring net new customers is expensive –– and if a customer only purchases from you once, your return on ad spend (ROAS) doesn’t increase over time.</p>
<h3 class="p6">How to Calculate Customer Lifetime Value</h3>
<p class="p1">Customer lifetime value informs nearly every business decision, but none more than ad and marketing spend.</p>
<p class="p1">First, you need to nail down the CLV that will be your north star. There are several ways to do this, but more importantly than which method you go with is consistency once that decision is made (for more on <a href="http://blog.ometria.com/how-to-calculate-customer-lifetime-value-clv-in-ecommerce">manually calculating CLV, Ometria</a> has an excellent tutorial).</p>
<p class="p1">If you are a BigCommerce customer, you can use your Analytics to download and then sort your customers by purchase date.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/clv.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21329" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/clv.png" alt="" width="640" height="323" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/clv.png 1155w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/clv-300x151.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/clv-750x379.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Easily configure customer lifetime value (LTV) by exporting your customer groups and viewing total spend with your company on a customer cohort level. You can even do it by each individual customer.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Better yet, if you are an Insights customer, you get immediate cohort access to customer LTV in a variety of reports.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acquisition-cost.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21328" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acquisition-cost.png" alt="" width="640" height="305" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acquisition-cost.png 1137w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acquisition-cost-300x143.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acquisition-cost-750x357.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>BigCommerce Insights offers 6 LTV reports with easily downloadable cohorts you can use to target ads or emails to increase repeat purchasing rates, or find lookalike customers. </em></p>
<p class="p1">If you aren’t using BigCommerce, you can still get at this information by using your store analytics tool to download customer purchase and order history, and then match repeat customers. You may need to build out your own formula or combine multiple sets of data to get at your customer repeat purchase rate.</p>
<h3 class="p6">How to Use CLV — and Why it Matters</h3>
<p class="p1">CLV (or LTV) should inform nearly every business decision, but none more so than ad spend. The bang you get for your advertising buck is inextricably tied to what you can expect every customer to bring you in the long term — not just their first time purchasing from your store.</p>
<p class="p1">When you combine LTV <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-metrics/">with other metrics</a> like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies/">retention rate</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-is-customer-acquisition-cost-cac/">customer acquisition cost</a>, churn rate, net profit and ROAS, you start to get a very clear picture of what you can do to improve margins.</p>
<p class="p1">A low average ROAS will influence how much you spend on advertising –– likely meaning you won’t be able to afford to bring on net new customers at scale in the long run.</p>
<p class="p1">When you spend your business resources on an ad, the goal is to make sure that ad produces as much revenue as possible. Here’s a quick way to calculate ROAS:</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Gross Revenue from Ad campaign</strong></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">ROAS = _______________________</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Cost of Ad Campaign</strong></p>
<p class="p1">For example, a company that spends $2,000 on an online advertising campaign in a single month. In this month, the campaign results in revenue of $10,000. Therefore, the ROAS is a ratio of 5 to 1 (or 500%) as $10,000 divided by $2,000 = $5.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Revenue: $10,000</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Cost: $2000</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>ROAS = $5 OR 5:1</em></p>
<p class="p1">For every dollar that the company spends on its advertising campaign, it generates $5 worth of revenue.</p>
<h3 class="p6">What is a good ROAS?</h3>
<p class="p1">An acceptable ROAS is influenced by profit margins, operating expenses, and the overall health of the business.</p>
<p class="p1">While there&#8217;s no &#8220;right&#8221; answer, a common ROAS benchmark is a 4:1 ratio — $4 revenue to $1 in ad spend. Cash-strapped start-ups may require higher margins, while online stores committed to growth can afford higher advertising costs.</p>
<p class="p1">This is where LTV comes in. The higher your LTV is, the low your ROAS ratio can be for the short-term (understanding that the ratio will increase over time as the customer purchases additional items).</p>
<p class="p1">Some businesses require an ROAS of 10:1 in order to stay profitable, and others can grow substantially at just 3:1. A business can only gauge its ROAS goal when it has a defined budget and firm handle on its profit margins.</p>
<p class="p1">A large margin means that the business can survive a low ROAS; smaller margins are an indication the business must maintain low advertising costs. An ecommerce store in this situation must achieve a relatively high ROAS to reach profitability. In other words, if you have a low margin, LTV is more important to your business in order to achieve a higher ROAS ratio over time.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, let’s take a look at 5 brands who are using S Loyalty, among other tools and tactics, to build customer loyalty and repeat purchases –– two measurements of a healthy LTV.</p>

<p class="p1">The Cloud Alchemist is a boutique vapor liquid brand based out of Seattle, WA. They design and produce their own products, from initial design, down to laboratory production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">After speaking with Trevor Taylor, founder of The Cloud Alchemist, I learned that their customer loyalty strategy is all about being personable and connecting with their customers, as demonstrated by how frequently they engage directly with their customers to add value.</p>
<p class="p1">“I&#8217;ve talked with people about the birth of a new child, buying their first house, and losing jobs.</p>
<p class="p1">I gave store credit to a customer who&#8217;s hard up, sent spare hard drives to someone building computers for those in need, and even traded a t-shirt in exchange for someone&#8217;s home-made jerky.</p>
<p class="p1">This is not something you can fake, you have to be genuine, but the response to opening up and being human with customers is immeasurable.”</p>
<p class="p1">&#8211; Trevor Taylor, Cloud Alchemist</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">They’re active in their community, participating in Reddit groups, gatherings, Facebook communities, and more. Their team is always transparent about who they work for and where their biases lie. But, getting in front of potential customers as often as possible helps your brand to be seen as a thought leader and a helper –– making that customer’s next purchase decision more likely to be with you.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few other things The Cloud Alchemist does to increase customer lifetime value.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Send relevant, transparent emails</h3>
<p class="p1">A big part of being engaging is being relevant.</p>
<p class="p1">Being relevant doesn’t mean you have to send an individualized and personalized email to every single customer. Instead, it means that we set up your automation streams to address people by their given name (if your form collects it) and prompts them to take an action relevant to the action they’ve just taken on your site.</p>
<p class="p1">For instance, The Cloud Alchemist team emails new customers after a purchase, encouraging them to review the product for the vape community JuiceDB.</p>
<p class="p1">JuiceDB is a leading community review site for the vape industry, and The Cloud Alchemist makes it clear to customers that their review –– good or bad –– cannot be altered by their team. Instead, the brand is dedicated to making sure the best flavors have the highest reviews in the community, despite which ones those are.</p>
<p class="p1">After all, it helps to educate the entire industry.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s what that email looks like:</p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21326" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discount-rate.png" alt="" width="640" height="1585" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discount-rate.png 646w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discount-rate-300x743.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">This is a great way for The Cloud Alchemist to get feedback, see what can be improved, improve customer satisfaction, and also gain exposure with public feedback that’s shared with the community.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Deliver a personal touch</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21325" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-1-300x400.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-1-750x1000.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">With every order that goes out, The Cloud Alchemist team includes a handwritten thank you message on their packing slips.</p>
<p class="p1">Included alongside stickers, cards, and other branded items, they take this opportunity to thank the customer personally for this business. After all, every customer has a choice, and their choice impacts your bottom line. If they choose to do with you, especially in a crowded industry, take that extra step to thank them for their time and prove your dedication to them as a customer. It will often be returned.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Reward customers for their loyalty</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21324" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-calculation.png" alt="" width="640" height="506" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-calculation.png 1554w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-calculation-300x237.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-calculation-750x593.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The Cloud Alchemist uses S Loyalty for their customer loyalty program solution. Like their approach to personalized emails, for their loyalty program, The Cloud Alchemist has turned on storefront notifications to showcase relevant reminders to shoppers about the loyalty program as they visit their site.</p>
<p class="p1">Enabling notifications has helped them with more consistent loyalty program engagement and has increased engagement outside of the segment of users that already engaging with the program.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s what Trevor had to say about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“There were a handful of customers that religiously used their points as they accrued them (mostly at the $10-20 reward mark), but this year we also turned on the email feature to remind customers that they had points to spend 14 days after earning enough to redeem.</p>
<p class="p1">It has been my personal impression that, since setting it up, we&#8217;ve had a marked uptick in returning customers using redeemed rewards and having those orders come through at a more regular and even pace (vs a tendency to have &#8220;hot&#8221; days where stacks of orders come in, generally on Fridays/paydays).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Each of these customer loyalty strategies builds customer lifetime value for The Cloud Alchemist. This is especially important in a crowded industry, where customers have a plethora of choices when it comes to where to purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Be sure to give your customers a feeling of personalization so that when they buy again, they buy from you.</p>
<h2 class="p7">2. How to Earn LTV Utilizing a Quality at Quantity Strategy</h2>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/relationship.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21323" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/relationship.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/relationship.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/relationship-300x190.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/relationship-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Super Hair Pieces is a direct-to-consumer hair piece store. Providing a wide assortment of styles, sizes, and colors, they have one of the largest inventories of hair pieces available online.</p>
<p class="p1">When I spoke with George Li about how they attracted a loyal following of repeat customers, it immediately became clear that their strategy is all about the product.</p>
<p class="p1">By delivering great hairpieces at the best possible prices, Super Hair Pieces has created a fighting force within the hair pieces industry.</p>
<p class="p1">The money they save with a lean strategy, they pass on to their customers. Here’s how it works.</p>
<h3 class="p8">Lower prices for increase loyalty</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21322" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/what-is-ltv.png" alt="" width="640" height="501" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/what-is-ltv.png 1556w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/what-is-ltv-300x235.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/what-is-ltv-750x587.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">When a new potential customer comes to your site, it is better that they come at the recommendation of a friend rather than through an ad.</p>
<p class="p1">Why?</p>
<p class="p1">Because social proof is incredibly valuable, and people believe that brands they are recommended to are better than others –– often even if they aren’t.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are <a href="http://blog.accessdevelopment.com/customer-loyalty-statistics-2016-edition">a couple stats</a> for you to chew on:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">People are 4x more likely to buy something when recommended by a friend</li>
<li class="p1">67% of consumers modify the brands/companies they purchase from in order to maximize points.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Added both of those stats up –– and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-set-up-a-loyalty-program-and-increase-customer-lifetime-value-more-than-150/">getting a loyalty program up and running for your business</a> can mean serious $$$.</p>
<p class="p1">Super Hair Pieces implemented a loyalty program two year ago. The savings that George can offer through points and rewards encourages customer retention, as well as referrals, and allows the brand to focus on delivering what they do best (selling a great product as an affordable price).</p>
<p class="p1">Today, a healthy part of Super Hair Pieces’ customer base are loyal, repeat customers –– all without any major marketing campaigns.</p>
<h2 class="p7">3. How a Niche Brand Makes Gains on Industry-Wide LTV</h2>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21321" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-1.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-1-300x190.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-1-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Swiss Rasoi is an online specialty grocery store that sells Indian spices and ingredients. They’re based in Switzerland and serve the Swiss market with free delivery, and a vast selection of spices and staples needed for Indian cuisine.</p>
<p class="p1">They’ve created a colorful brand filled with quality images that reflect their product offerings –– i.e. Quality ingredients. This brand design is consistent across their online store, as well as, their social media channels, helping to reinforce a consistent, trustworthy message.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s are <a href="http://blog.accessdevelopment.com/customer-loyalty-statistics-2016-edition">a couple more stats</a> for you:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">83% of consumers say loyalty is driven primarily by trust</li>
<li class="p1">26% of consumers mention the terms “trust” and “consistency” as an important element of brand loyalty</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Swiss Rasoi offers traditional products delivered right to your doorstep. With added conveniences like free delivery, unbeatable prices, and access to hard-to-find ingredients, they’ve created a brand where an increasing number of their customers come back to buy more.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Beautiful, resonating content for their community</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21320" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="422" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-2.png 856w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-2-300x198.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-2-750x495.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The Swiss community for authentic Indian spices and ingredients <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/find-product-niche-start-selling-online/">might have started as a small niche</a>, but Swiss Rasoi is creating brand recognition throughout the Swiss food industry. By delivering their color branded images which reflect their offerings, they create content that’s immediately recognizable with clear callouts.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition, every month, Swiss Rasoi hosts flash sales you can only find on their social media channels –– specifically Facebook.</p>
<p class="p1">By offering discounts on their already great prices, flash sales create an urgency for their customers to come back, make more purchases, and add to the brand’s overall LTV value.</p>

<h3 class="p6">More savings for loyal customers</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21319" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="502" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-2.png 1552w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-2-300x235.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-2-750x589.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">In addition to offering their customers savings from offers and flash sales, Swiss Rasoi a loyalty program to give their best customers another avenue for saving on their quality ingredients.</p>
<p class="p1">When free shipping and low prices are standard, offering additional discounts through a loyalty program is something extra that Swiss Rasoi can give back to their loyal customers.</p>
<p class="p1">The more your purchase, the less you pay.</p>
<h2 class="p7">4. How to Play on the Power of Convenience for Increased LTV</h2>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21318" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-300x190.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Based in New Jersey, DBDPet became the largest dry goods vendor at reptile shows after just 6 years in business.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a classic startup story: they started in a garage with one bearded dragon that laid eggs. Now they are expanding beyond a 5,000 sq ft warehouse by breeding exotic animals, and offering supplies for every kind of pet.</p>
<p class="p1">DBDPet realized, however, that it was difficult to explain where to buy supplies for the pets they sold. Today, they strive to be a one-stop shop for all reptile supplies while providing accurate and useful information about the nurturing and care for these pets.</p>
<p class="p1">For DBDPet, their path to customer loyalty was built from their expertise and the steady stream of advice and content they deliver to their community.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Offering expert advice through social media</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21317" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="352" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-1.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-1-300x165.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-1-750x413.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-1-1596x881.png 1596w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Customers that shop at DBDPet come for the supplies, but stay for the advice and knowledge.</p>
<p class="p1">Social media became a way for Buddy and his team to spread their wisdom learned through years of experience in exotic pets.</p>
<p class="p1">They create a constant stream of content for Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, which are essential for them to keep their current customers engaged, while helping to reach new ones.</p>
<h3 class="p6">A loyalty program for a one-stop shop</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21316" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="719" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-2.png 1092w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-2-300x337.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-2-750x842.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">As DBDPet became a one-stop shop for exotic pets, their knowledge and expertise became the foundation of their customer loyalty strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">By offering a broad range of products, they cater to every need of their customers. You can say they are the Amazon of exotic pet supplies –– and we all know how loyal Amazon shoppers are.</p>
<p class="p1">DBDPet uses a loyalty program to further encourage customers to who their one-stop shop for all exotic pet and pet supply needs.</p>
<h3 class="p7">5. Florida Colors Nursery</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21315" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-3.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-3-300x190.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-3-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Florida Colors Nursery is a staple in the Plumeria community. Currently offering more than 1,200 varieties, many of which are their own, they also focus on providing extensive knowledge on growing, grafting, and cultivating Plumeria plants.</p>
<p class="p1">I briefly spoke with Tex Norwood, and it’s obvious that he and his team are fanatics about Plumeria flowers. Their customer loyalty comes from their thought leadership in the shared community around these flowers.</p>
<h3 class="p6">More than a thousand varieties shared on social media</h3>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21314" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4.png" alt="" width="640" height="368" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4-798x457.png 798w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4-300x173.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4-750x432.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4-1596x914.png 1596w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Alongside multiple properties about Plumeria, Social Media has been a primary outlet for sharing the beautiful photos of these plants. With so many colors, combinations, shapes, and sizes, each one is best cared for a little differently than the next.</p>
<p class="p1">They’ve built a loyal following by sharing their latest cultivations, while providing best practices on how to care and keep them healthy. In total, they have thousands of followers within their community engaged with their Facebook page, community websites, and store.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s immediately obvious that Tex and his business partners are experts when it comes to Plumeria. Customers can find an endless bucket of wisdom and knowledge to best grow, graft, cultivate, and enjoy these flowers.</p>
<p class="p1">As for their loyalty program, customers are rewarded each time they buy, adding up to store credit and lower overall cost for the customer (plus great social referrals for the brand).</p>
<p class="p4"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-5.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21313" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-5.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-5.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-5-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-5-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p7">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">These five stores each have a different approach to customer retention and customer loyalty –– ultimately leading to increased LTV –– which proves that there’s no one right way of keeping your customers engaged.</p>
<p class="p1">However, the one thing that all of these have in common is that they offer something that resonates well with their customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Whether that’s a wealth of expertise, affordable prices, or being passionate and personable; the lesson here is to treat your customers well, and they’ll return the favor.</p>

The orders are rolling in and your business is primed for explosive growth.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s it, right?</p>
<p class="p1">Not so fast. While product-market fit and user acquisition are undoubtedly crucial to your business, ecommerce fulfillment is the engine that keeps your car running.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s start from the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="p3">What is order fulfillment?</h2>
<p class="p1">Fulfillment encompasses the entire process of receiving an order and delivering it to a customer. As anyone well-versed in operational ecommerce is aware, this actually encompasses a number of complex steps throughout the supply chain that all play a significant role in how customers perceive your business.</p>
<p class="p1">To name only a few of the steps, proper fulfillment requires:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Warehouse organization</li>
<li class="p1">Order management</li>
<li class="p1">Packaging</li>
<li class="p1">Shipping</li>
<li class="p1">Customer communication</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">But you may not have to do some — or all — of those processes in-house.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are a medium-sized or growing business, it’s likely that you have begun to investigate <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/fulfillment-delivery/">order fulfillment services</a>, and might have experimented with one already. While small businesses can often <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/inventory-management-software/">manage their inventory</a>, packing, and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">shipping</a>, as the operation scales up, additional support is needed and beneficial.</p>
<p class="p1">Product fulfillment is the most important artery supporting the overall health of a quickly growing ecommerce business. Understanding what options are out there, how they can help, and which is best for your business is a critical decision-making process.</p>
<p class="p1">In this guide, we’ll walk through everything you need to know about three of the most popular strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Drop-shipping</li>
<li class="p1">Third-party ecommerce fulfillment</li>
<li class="p1">Self-fulfillment</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">And we’ll look specifically at the following in regards to each of your options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">How to define the various industry terms</li>
<li class="p1">The advantages and disadvantages of each technique</li>
<li class="p1">For which companies or business models <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/dropshipping/">dropshipping makes the most sense (and why)</a></li>
<li class="p1">For which companies or business models third-party fulfillment makes the most sense (and why)</li>
<li class="p1">How to choose an order fulfillment system</li>
<li class="p1">When it’s time to establish your own product fulfilment and distribution center</li>
<li class="p1">Next steps for your business right now</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The ultimate goal with this guide is that you understand what each fulfillment technique is, when to use it, how it works, and how to get started. You can then select the right solution to take your company to the next level and ultimately sell more. Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Defining Order Fulfillment Terms</h2>
<p class="p1">Let’s take a look at how the order fulfillment process works in three common models.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Dropshipping</h3>
<p class="p1">With dropshipping, inventory is not owned before the sale is made.</p>
<p class="p1">The seller is a middleman, often never actually seeing or “possessing” the product, but rather focusing on marketing it to customers and making sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Once goods are sold, the seller has them shipped directly to the customer from a dedicated dropshipper, or the manufacturer.</p>
<p class="p1">Stores that drop ship deal exclusively with marketing and branding, but outsource the logistics of ecommerce, i.e. the fulfillment.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/order-fulfillment.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21298" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/order-fulfillment.png" alt="" width="641" height="514" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/order-fulfillment.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/order-fulfillment-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">There are a variety of dropshipping types –– and in all of which you, the seller, remain the middleman.</p>
<p class="p1">Say you sell furniture that you market through both your website and a brick-and-mortar showroom. With the dropshipping model, every time a customer places an order, you would then place an order with your source.</p>
<p class="p1">By doing so, you keep nothing on hand and your profit is made from the difference between your retail price and the price you pay your source for each product (along with any other associated costs).</p>
<p class="p1">Here is your profit calculation for this model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Profit = Retail Price &#8211; Price Per Product Bought from Dropshipper</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="p1">The dropshipping benefit:</h4>
<p class="p1">It isn’t just startups using dropshipping. Brands like Macy’s and Lord &amp; Taylor use dropshipping from their suppliers to alleviate risk (i.e. the risk of buying too much of a product that just won’t sell).</p>
<p class="p1">Dropshipping helps both startups and larger organizations understand what the market wants before committing fully to creating a custom item, or buying in bulk.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Third-Party Fulfillment</h3>
<p class="p1">With <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-is-a-3pl-third-party-logistics-and-ecommerce">third-party fulfillment</a>, inventory is owned before the sale is made. The seller often purchases or manufactures the product, stores the inventory with the third-party company, and then markets the product in order to sell it.</p>
<p class="p1">When an order is processed, the third party (NOT the online store) packages the order and ships it to the customer. Third parties also usually help with COGS and economies of scale.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21297" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment.png" alt="" width="640" height="432" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment.png 640w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Let’s continue with the same example of a furniture business. With third-party <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/ecommerce-fulfillment/">ecommerce fulfillment</a>, you may still have a website and showroom for marketing, but when a customer places an order, you already have the inventory.</p>
<p class="p1">Your third-party logistics provider (3PL) is contacted (this can be automated on your ecommerce platform), and they package the product and ship it to the customer. Your profit will be the remaining difference between the retail price, the price you pay per product, and the fees you pay your third-party provider.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is what that looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Profit = Retail Price &#8211; Price Per Product &#8211; 3PL fees</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="p1">The 3PL benefit:</h4>
<p class="p1">Using a 3PL to outsource picking, packing and shipping frees up your time to focus on marketing, finding net new customers, nurturing repeat customers and more.</p>
<p class="p1">Brands of all sizes use 3PLs, and most 3PLs integrate directly with ecommerce platform like BigCommerce, so once someone places an order, the system alerts the 3PL to pick, pack and ship –– no manual work on your end needing to be done.</p>
<p class="p1">3PLs are best for brands which have their own, unique product (in dropshipping, you are using a supplier’s product), no inventory space and want to focus on acquisition rather than shipping.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Self-Fulfillment &amp; Shipping</h3>
<p class="p1">With self-fulfillment (or “direct fulfillment”), you own the inventory and fulfill orders yourself — no outside party involved.</p>
<p class="p1">Often, a warehouse is leased where pickers and packers handle the orders and a WMS (Warehouse Management Software) is purchased as well. The warehouse usually acts as the distribution center, or “hub” for all of your fulfillment.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/supply-chain.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21296" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/supply-chain.png" alt="" width="641" height="384" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/supply-chain.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/supply-chain-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In our same furniture business example, you have your own warehouse space for storing inventory and handle fulfilling the orders in-house. You might even use your own workforce to pack and ship items.</p>
<p class="p1">In the self-fulfillment model, profit is the difference between your retail price and the costs associated with buying inventory, storing it, and fulfilling orders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Profit= Retail Price &#8211; Inventory Buying &#8211; Inventory Storing &#8211; Fulfillment costs</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="p1">The self-fulfillment benefit:</h4>
<p class="p1">With self-fulfillment, you are in control. For startups, choosing self-fulfillment may save you money (though certainly will cost you in time) as you pick, pack and ship items yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">For larger organizations, self-fulfillment gives you control over exactly how your items are picked and packed, and when they are shipped to meet customer expectations.</p>
<p class="p1">Brands choosing self-fulfillment are often particular about the delivery experience, which means more control during packing is required.</p>
<h2 class="p7">Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Each Fulfillment Technique</h2>
<h3 class="p3">Drop-Shipping</h3>
<p class="p1">Although a drop-shipping model creates an easy and inexpensive way to add products to your online store, those same low barriers to entry are a double-edged sword.</p>
<p class="p1">This can be a great way to get going, and for efficient operations, can even sustain growth. Understanding the pros and cons before you start is crucial to drop-shipping success.</p>
<h4 class="p4">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Easy to start:</strong> Drop-shippers provide the products and the shipping, so all you need to do is focus on sales.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Minimal business development:</strong> You’re leveraging the network of your drop-shipper, instead of personally building the relationships with every supplier. Essentially, every new partner allows you to grow by a significantly large number of new products.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>More products, faster:</strong> Growth in ecommerce begins with adding more products to your website. Integrating a drop-shipper’s products with your business is simple and straightforward because all you’re doing is supporting the links and learning the prices—not lining up any other part of the logistics.This allows more people to discover you and increases the number of touchpoints by which interested shoppers can encounter your brand.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Affordable:</strong> Low overhead makes drop shipping a great starting place for online retailers. All you do is pay for inventory when a sale is made, so you avoid operational expenses like warehousing. Profitability is not guaranteed, though, which we’ll get to in the next section.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Test before committing:</strong> Since you don’t incur overhead, you can test out the viability of new markets for existing products anywhere you can establish a drop-shipper service.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Focus on what you do well:</strong> The convenience of a hands-off product fulfillment experience thereby enables businesses to focus on other priorities, which is especially advantageous to new companies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p4">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>No customization:</strong> Drop shipping usually means virtually no support for custom products. To achieve this type of support and customization, your dropshipper would have to function as a warehouse.  Unfortunately, this is not likely unless their margins on custom products were worth the time and effort — in which case, the margins would likely not make sense for you.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Lower quality control:</strong> Since the seller is removed from the fulfillment process, you’re entrusting your brand’s reputation to another party — while maintaining accountability. Buyers usually don’t think about fulfillment models or drop shippers. If a defective product arrives or there is a miscommunication about the shipment, your customer doesn’t want to hear that it was out of your control; all they care about is the overall experience.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Reduced brand power: </strong>Your products are produced by others, so it’s more difficult to establish a unique brand. The reduced quality control only increases the risk to your brand.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Competitive (dis)advantage:</strong> Low barriers to entry mean it’s hard to establish a competitive advantage over other businesses. You’re competing on price, and that can easily become a losing game.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Scale:</strong> Logistics can become challenging as a business scales up, especially when coordinating with multiple drop-shippers.</li>

<h3 class="p3">Third-Party Ecommerce Fulfillment</h3>
<p class="p1">Third party fulfillment can provide you with a national or even global footprint of warehouses, allowing you to reach out customers faster while taking advantage of shipping discounts.</p>
<p class="p1">However, picking, packing, and storage fees can cut into your profit margin, particularly for slim-margin stores.</p>
<h4 class="p4">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Inventory can be purchased in bulk</strong> in order to improve profit margins.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>No investment is required</strong> for warehouse space/real estate, WMS software, or a workforce to pick and pack orders.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>There is an added convenience of outsourcing</strong> the process to a trusted professional.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Shipping discounts</strong> can be much better than if you were to negotiate on your own.
<ul>
<li class="p1">I.e: Your business ships 5,000 packages per month, but the third-party ecommerce fulfillment company may be handling 150,000 orders per month. They’re going to be able to get better shipping rates with FedEx/UPS than you can alone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p4">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Quality can be compromised.
<ul>
<li class="p1">You have to do your due diligence: a third-party ecommerce fulfillment company controls your ecommerce business’s final handoff of value to your customers. In other words, they have the opportunity to make or break your customer satisfaction levels, which affects the lifetime value of these customers on your business.</li>

<h3 class="p3">Self-Fulfillment</h3>
<p class="p1">Self-fulfillment, when done correctly, can add a huge competitive advantage to you store.</p>
<p class="p1">The problem is it can be extremely capital intensive, and one needs to think carefully about the location of their warehouse, as well as the time it will take to operate your own logistical process on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<h4 class="p4">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>It offers 100% control</strong> of inventory and the pick, pack, and ship process.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>It can be low-cost</strong> when the business is small because you are just paying for shipping (and doing the work yourself).</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Anyone can do it.</strong> You don’t need any contacts (as long as you have space to store products, address labels, and packing resources such as packing slips).</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>For businesses shipping significant volume</strong>, negotiated shipping rates through FedEx, UPS, and/or USPS can become a competitive advantage.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p4">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1">It is time-consuming. Packing all of the products yourself will take time. As orders increase, this can take up most of your day.</li>
<li class="p1">It is costly as the business grows and can be very burdensome for a young business. You need the following:
<ul>
<li class="p1">Warehouse space</li>
<li class="p1">Warehouse equipment</li>
<li class="p1">Additional staff</li>
<li class="p1">Order fulfillment software requirements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">With these pros and cons in mind, let’s look more closely at how each technique works, situations where each is most beneficial, and tips on getting started.</p>

<h2 class="p7">When Does a Drop-Shipping Model Make Sense?</h2>
<p class="p1">Being that drop-shipping has a low price of entry and therefore presents a limited amount of risk, it can be a good solution for a lean startup looking to break into a market, or for an established business that wants to test out a new market.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s dig into how this technique can be utilized for companies of your size.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Drop-Shipping for Startups</h3>
<p class="p1">Let’s say you’re a travel blogger with tens of thousands of followers. A lot of your followers want to get your “swag,” such as hats, t-shirts, and the new travel bag that you designed.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re not sure if you want to invest a ton of time and money into a new ecommerce business, but you find an on-demand tee-shirt printer and hat embroiderer who will drop-ship orders for you.</p>
<p class="p1">By utilizing them, you can start processing orders and have the drop-shipper print and embroider your products as the orders come in. If orders really take off, great, then you know the idea will work and you can look into ordering your shirts, hats, and whatever new products you want to buy in bulk.</p>
<p class="p1">If they don’t take off, then you’re not in a bad position because you haven’t built up an inventory.</p>
<p class="p1">Drop-shipping allows you a chance to break into a market, establish your brand, and generate a small amount of income that you can use to fuel bulk purchase orders and eventually increase your profit margins.</p>
<p class="p1">It can be a smart tactic for startups, but you should note that this isn’t the same path you’d take if you were an existing company looking to try out a new market.</p>

<h3 class="p3">Drop-Shipping for Existing Companies</h3>
<p class="p1">Let’s say you run an ecommerce store selling high-quality children’s toys. You’re great at what you do and have earned a very loyal following with your customer base.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, you have a wonderful relationship with your third-party fulfillment provider, which handles all your inventory coming in from suppliers overseas, as well as a few boutique suppliers in the U.S.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21295" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-1.png" alt="" width="641" height="193" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-1.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-1-300x90.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You decide that you want to explore other channels that the company can enter with new products. Given the strong customer base your business already has, you decide to test out sales for quality child strollers.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21294" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-2.png" alt="" width="208" height="193" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">At this point, you could look for a mass supplier for strollers, invest in an initial bulk order, and begin marketing them to test customer interest. However, you are then at risk of losing your investment if the products don’t sell, or at a minimum, tying up cash in a bunch of inventory that sells very slowly.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, you could use the “bullets before cannonballs” approach, where you test the waters before going in full-force.</p>
<p class="p1">Do this by hiring a drop-shipper and beginning to market the new product lines to test customer interest before investing in the products.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21293" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-3.png" alt="" width="641" height="365" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-3.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-3-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">This strategy effectively removes the risk, allowing your established business to remain agile while testing a new market.</p>
<p class="p1">Sure, your profit margins may be lower on a per-unit basis, but partnering with a drop-shipper allows you to instantly launch a new product on your online store and test your assumptions before making a big cash investment.</p>
<p class="p1">Lando Landis, founder of <a href="https://www.rockerrags.com/search.php?search_query=luggage">RockerRags</a>, sells apparel for those seeking a rock-and-roll lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1">Most of his apparel sells for less than $30, but customers were still eager to purchase versions of the classic <a href="https://www.rockerrags.com/search.php?search_query=luggage">Pan Am luggage sets</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-21292 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-pan-am.png" alt="" width="500" height="402" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-pan-am.png 500w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-pan-am-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Rather than tie up several thousand dollars in the Pan Am inventory, Lando established a drop-shipping relationship with the manufacturer to handle the order fulfillment for the Pan Am merchandise.</p>
<p class="p2"> As Lando explained,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“This ended up being a great move because demand for the Pan Am product line tends to be pretty cyclical. Around the holidays it spikes, and sometimes in the spring. Because of the drop-shipper, I don’t have to worry about allocating cash to buy inventory up front but I still get the advantages of offering the products for sale online.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="p3">How to Land Your Drop-Shipping Partnership</h3>
<p class="p1">Dave Hermansen, who operates <a href="https://storecoach.com/">StoreCoach</a>, helps businesses and entrepreneurs establish and operate their online stores.</p>
<p class="p1">Dave operates nearly 60 independent stores of his own, 80% of which utilize drop-shipping fulfillment to some extent.</p>
<p class="p10"><img class="wp-image-21291 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-5.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-5.png 1439w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-5-300x157.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-5-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Dave has the following tips:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Find the top ranking specialty store for the product you want to drop-ship</strong>: Do research on the Google search volume for these products and the top selling brands, to better understand what opportunity exists if you were to acquire a small % of total search volume and sales.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Go to the root</strong>: Use Google to find the manufacturer for the product/brand. Most of the time the brand and the manufacturing company use the same name, (think Sony products and Sony manufacturing) but other times things may be less obvious. A simple (or advanced) Google search is the best place to start. You want to find the company who owns the manufacturing process of the products you want to sell, and then get the contact information for their sales team. Cross-referencing the manufacturer’s company name with Linkedin is an easy way to accomplish this.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Engage with the Sales Team, but leave out all mention of drop-shipping at first</strong>: The reality is manufacturers are bombarded with drop-shipping requests every week. Dave suggests intentionally leaving out all mention of drop-shipping at first. Instead, once you’ve developed a relationship with the sales rep, use a phrase like this:
<ul>
<li class="p1">“..we really want to add your brand to our store, but we want to see what products sells best for your product line… Do you mind if the manufacturer ships direct for the first 90 days, as we test out the new product line…?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Sometimes the manufacturer will refuse, if so, ask for the contact details for their 2-3 largest distributors</strong>: Then, use this information to repeat step 3.
<ul>
<li class="p1">Often times, dealing with a distributor can be more advantageous than dealing with the manufacturer because distributors likely deal with multiple brands, giving you an even wider opportunity to add products via a drop-shiping model to your store!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p4">A Drop-Shipping Drawback for Larger Brands</h3>
<p class="p1">There comes a point in the life of every business where customers take a risk on a new idea because of your brand. You’ve got a lot of existing, loyal customers who will hold anything new to your old standards of quality and care.</p>
<p class="p1">One concern with drop-shipping for established businesses is that you’re handing control of your products and customer service over to another company. This will limit your ability to brand an offer and may ultimately cut against your larger marketing efforts if your next product is an extension of an existing line.</p>
<p class="p1">Drop-shipping can cause this to get away from you because you’re sourcing and selling from multiple warehouses, which could cause inventory shortages. Plus, you’re no longer sticking to your branding; you’re selling something that any other company can partner with your drop-shipper to sell.</p>
<p class="p1">We often hear larger companies pitched about using drop-shipping when they want to expand and test a new market. It is cheaper than creating deals, but you ultimately are trading in name recognition for early, low-margin sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Every ecommerce brand knows that good reviews sell. If you look through your highest-rated reviews and find mentions not only of your products, but also your customer service teams and shipping times, drop-shipping may take away what your customers have come to appreciate and expect.</p>
<h2>3 Chief Drop-Ship Considerations</h2>
<p class="p1">So what can you expect when hiring a drop-shipper? Here are a few of the common practices.</p>
<h3 class="p4">1) Predefined Product Selection</h3>
<p class="p1">Each drop-shipper will give you a list of products that you can sell based on their manufacturing partners. Exclusive are sometimes available, but opportunities tend to be limited.</p>
<p class="p1">Drop-shippers should tell you the minimum price you can set for a product (when set by the manufacturer), which will allow you to make some revenue off of each sale.</p>
<h3 class="p4">2) Drop-Ship Fee</h3>
<p class="p1">There is a standard fee in the industry, which is typically charged on a per-item basis to cover the drop-shipper’s costs for packing and shipping an item. The amount typically ranges from $2 to $5, but can be higher, depending on the type of product.</p>
<p class="p1">Fees can be paid as soon as an order is placed, or within a certain time frame set out in your invoice terms.</p>
<h3 class="p4">3) Minimum Monthly Order</h3>
<p class="p1">Many drop-shippers require a minimum amount on your initial order to weed out the less serious customers. For example, you may encounter a $200 minimum order when your product only costs $50.</p>
<p class="p1">This is normal.</p>
<p class="p2">You can simply deposit the minimum amount, and it will be a credit in your account.</p>
<h2 class="p3">What to Look for in a Drop-Shipper</h2>
<p class="p1">When choosing a drop-shipper, here are a few tips to keep in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>If you know which product you want to sell</strong>, contact the manufacturer directly and ask for their wholesale distributors. Then, contact the distributors on the list and ask if they drop-ship.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Look for up-to-date technology such as a thorough online catalog</strong>, real-time inventory management, online searchable purchase history, and the like. These will help to enable a seamless experience for you and your customers.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Ask how they process orders</strong>. It’s very convenient to place orders by email. However, some providers are limited to taking orders over the phone or strictly through the website. Depending on your level of order automation, you’ll likely want to find a drop-shipper that can match or enhance your ordering process.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Good location is important</strong>. The distance your drop-shipper is from your customers will affect delivery time and their satisfaction levels.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Look for good customer support</strong>. It is best if you have your own customer service representative assigned to you and any issues you may have.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In summary, drop-shipping is a low-risk technique that is good for breaking into new markets. As you saw in both the examples, it can lead you to the place where it makes sense to invest in bulk purchasing. When that happens, third-party ecommerce fulfillment can help.</p>
<h2 class="p7">When to Partner with a Third-Party Fulfillment Company</h2>
<p class="p1">Understanding when and how to choose a fulfillment solution partner are critical steps to a successful online business.</p>

<p class="p1">With so many orders placed, the question of how Craig was single-handedly going to fulfill over 4,000 orders to his eager customers became a primary concern.</p>
<p class="p1">With the daunting task of over 4,000 orders to be fulfilled, Craig partnered with a fulfillment specialist in the eastern part of the country to complement his location in Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p class="p1">Craig explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“the fulfillment company was a huge help with the massive number of orders placed on KickStarter, but once those orders were fulfilled, I realized that having only one product (in five different colors), along with smaller quantities of orders streaming in after the KickStarter campaign, it was fairly easy for me to handle most of the fulfillment on my own.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Now Craig leverages his fulfillment partner for other benefits, such as the discounted shipping rates for international shipments, or spikes in order volume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“My 3PL was able to provide significantly better international shipping rates, so they handle all non-domestic orders, and sometimes international orders if volume spikes,” Craig said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">While <a href="https://theairhook.com/">AirHook</a>’s surge in KickStarter orders is a great problem to be dealing with, it’s critical for growing and established brands to understand what core competencies are driving their business growth, and to ensure that your company is able to focus on those functions that will continue to “move the needle” for your online store</p>
<p class="p1">Having a dependable fulfillment partner, either a supplement to your drop shipping or self-fulfillment operations, or to handle your order fulfillment altogether, is a great way to ensure that your time is spent on those core competencies. Let’s take a closer look at when it’s a good idea to partner with a 3PL and the factors you should consider when choosing one.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">If you are a growing startup that’s finally hit enough buyers to outgrow storing and shipping products out of your mom’s basement (congrats!), it’s a good time to turn to a 3PL.</li>
<li class="p1">If you are an existing small- to mid-size established business (with online revenue in the high seven or low eight figures) and your distribution network is not a core competency, 3PL will also be helpful.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Choosing a 3PL means not having to deal with the major financial and logistical demands that come with fulfillment. Instead of investing in forklifts and other expensive, constantly depreciating equipment, you can focus on growing your marketing exposure.</p>
<p class="p1">You won’t need to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars annually on warehouse space, employees that present liability, and expensive software, but can instead focus on existing product design and testing.</p>
<p class="p1">A 3PL is a surefire way to loosen up cash flow back into more important functions that increase your revenue in the long run.</p>
<h2 class="p3">How Third-Party Fulfillment Providers Work</h2>
<p class="p1">Billing from one provider to the next may vary greatly, but they generally will include the following fulfillment operations and billing charges.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Fulfillment Operations</h3>
<p class="p1">The invoice that a 3PL sends you might list a dozen separate charges, but most of them tend to fall into one of three broad categories.</p>
<h4 class="p1">1. Receiving Fees</h4>
<p class="p1">Receiving fees cover the cost of (drumroll, please) receiving containers full of products that need to be properly inventoried. They can be assessed in a number of ways. You may be charged:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">An hourly labor fee to unload a container</li>
<li class="p1">A flat fee for the task</li>
<li class="p1">By the pallet, box, or even item</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you sell small items like iPhone cover cases, getting charged by the item (even if it’s something piddling like $0.25) might end up being much more expensive than simply paying a flat fee to unload a whole container full of them. You’ll have to do the math and factor in the volume you sell to determine which rate makes the most sense for you.</p>
<h3 class="p1">2. Storage</h3>
<p class="p1">The other major fee—and this can be a big one—is for storage. Some companies charge by the pallet, while others go by the cubic foot. It’s also good to know that prices can fluctuate throughout the year.</p>
<p class="p1">Amazon, for example, is known for charging more for storage in the peak holiday shopping season, between October and January; other 3PLs have followed this demand-based model and have higher prices for storing inventory when there’s less available space in warehouses.</p>
<h3 class="p1">3. Picking</h3>
<p class="p1">A lot of time goes into finding one particular product in a warehouse that may be the size of 10 football fields (or more), and it still needs to be shuttled over and packed after it’s found. That’s why a common fee charged by 3PL providers is for picking a product off the shelf and running it over to the packing station.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, the pricing model itself may vary.</p>
<p class="p1">While some companies may charge you a flat per-item fee, others might charge extra if an item is over a certain weight limit or is especially fragile, since heavier or delicate items require extra labor to ensure proper handling.</p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Packing</h3>
<p class="p1">Once the package has been removed from its shelf in inventory, it goes to the packing stage. Some 3PLs include packing as part of their picking services. Others charge additional fees for basic packing supplies like boxes and padding.</p>
<p class="p1">Make sure to ask about what sort of packaging your partner uses.</p>
<p class="p1">Envelopes weigh less and take up less space than cardboard boxes, but sacrifice security in the process. Some of your products might involve kitting, such as combining three SKUs into one box.</p>
<p class="p1">When that happens, a 3PL might charge you a small fee to cover the extra labor involved. Additional packing-related charges include fulfillment fees, order insert fees, and outbound shipping fees (more on shipping fees below).</p>
<p class="p10"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-7.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21289" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-7.png" alt="" width="640" height="193" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-7.png 640w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-7-300x90.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4">5. Shipping Rates</h3>
<p class="p1">One of the major advantages offered by 3PLs is the discounted rate for shipping, which is passed on to clients.</p>
<p class="p1">Chances are your business isn’t moving the same volume of goods as an entire fulfillment warehouse, so it’s beneficial to let a 3PL take control of your operation and pass along those savings to you.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead of going directly to UPS or FedEx, letting the 3PL negotiate rates for you can save you a hefty chunk of change, particularly if your volume is not at a level where it’s a negotiating asset for you with the carriers.</p>
<p class="p1">3PL’s can also help you secure discounted freight shipments, both from the port to the fulfilment house, better <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/dimensional-weight-calculator/">DIM weight factors</a>, and for international shipments.</p>
<p class="p10"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-8.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21288" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-8.png" alt="" width="640" height="386" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-8.png 1024w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-8-300x181.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-8-750x453.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Once you begin to shop around and compare providers, you’ll find that different providers cater to different needs. For example, check out these niche ecommerce fulfillment services.</p>
<h3 class="p3">6. Niche Fulfillment Services</h3>
<p class="p1">One of the best ways to identify a successful fulfillment partner is to look for a fulfillment warehouse that specializes in <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/find-product-niche-start-selling-online/">your product type’s niche</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Do all of your products contain a lithium-ion battery, thus making them fall under a hazmat classification?</li>
<li class="p1">Are you shipping mostly small, lightweight bi-fold wallets?</li>
<li class="p1">Or large electronics?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">As you can imagine, the pick, pack, and ship operations for an <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/clothing-apparel/">online store selling t-shirts</a> is going to look and operate very differently than a warehouse picking and shipping boxed furniture. If your products fall under a hazmat classification, it can be especially important to find a fulfillment partner who can ensure that your shipments don’t break any laws.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, companies like <a href="https://www.printful.com/">Printful</a> specialize in on-demand printing and fulfillment of posters, apparel, and accessories.</p>
<p class="p1">If you already have your apparel printed and ready to distribute, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/whiplash/">Whiplash Fulfillment</a> is a perfect match, particularly with their low USPS rates for those lightweight packages.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other end of the spectrum, <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/">Red Stag Fulfillment</a> specializes in ecommerce stores with an average parcel weight greater than 5 pounds and hazmat products that ship via FedEx or UPS.</p>
<p class="p1">By identifying a fulfillment provider that fits your niche, your business can not only save a significant amount of money with tailored shipping discounts, but can also avoid major headaches down the road, and even legal liabilities such as hazmat compliance.</p>
<h3 class="p3">7. Location of Your Fulfillment Partner</h3>
<p class="p1">Another critical but often overlooked question is choosing the <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/choosing-location-fulfillment-warehouse/">location of your fulfillment center</a>. In order to keep shipping costs down, it’s best to choose a provider that is strategically located near your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">This is great for smaller shops with relatively concentrated (geographically) customers, but for larger shops who ship products across the country, your outbound shipping information likely mirrors the general populous of the U.S.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s say you live and operate your ecommerce store from Miami Florida. One of the worst things you can do is limit your search for a drop-shipper, your own warehouse space, or a 3rd party fulfillment partner, to only the Miami, FL area.</p>
<p class="p1">Besides having some pretty expensive land, Miami is located in a far corner of the country meaning your parcels are going to take longer, and cost more to reach your customer’s addresses.</p>
<p class="p10"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/efulfillment-service.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21287" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/efulfillment-service.png" alt="" width="641" height="407" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/efulfillment-service.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/efulfillment-service-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If your volume is high enough, another factor to consider is sales tax nexus. Most states add on sales tax based on the destination of the items you ship, but there are a few exceptions</p>
<p class="p1">Notably, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Montana don’t levy sales tax on remote sellers (neither does Alaska, but it goes without saying that you probably want to have your logistics HQ somewhere in the lower 48).</p>
<p class="p1">Those states offer close proximity to major populations centers on the East Coast, West Coast, and Upper Midwest.</p>
<p class="p10"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21286" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-satisfaction.png" alt="" width="641" height="407" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-satisfaction.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-satisfaction-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Lastly, on the subject of location, there’s no rule saying that your entire fulfillment operation has to be centered in just one place. If you have about equal demand on both sides of the country or in both the Far East and Europe — it’s sensible to stock your items in multiple locations.</p>
<p class="p1">With this understanding of the structure of 3PLs and how they work, here’s some advice on what to look for in potential providers.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Interview Questions for 3PLs</h2>
<p class="p1">The provider you choose will determine the quality experienced by your customers, which is vital to the success of your business.</p>
<p class="p1">Being so, a lengthy interview process should be the norm. Here are 20 questions to ask your potential fulfillment partner during the interview process:</p>
<p class="p10"><img class="wp-image-21285 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3pl-questionnaire.png" alt="" width="158" height="152" /></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Removing price from the equation, why does your company stand out from the competition?</li>
<li class="p1">What sort of new technology have you introduced in the last year, and has it enhanced processes?</li>
<li class="p1">How does your employee turnover compare to industry levels, and what do you do to ensure a secure, productive, and safe environment? Do you offer incentives for high performance?</li>
<li class="p1">What sort of plans do you have in place for peak-demand scenarios such as Black Friday or other major product rushes?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you have compliance and KPI reporting that allows us to view shipping in real time?</li>
<li class="p1">How do you deal with freight claims, returns, and other less-than-ideal outcomes?</li>
<li class="p1">If there was a natural disaster, power outage, software hack, or other major disruption, how would your company react?</li>
<li class="p1">How do you coordinate with freight companies to manage shipping and account for lost or damage claims?</li>
<li class="p1">Can you provide references from clients with a similar business profile/history?</li>
<li class="p1">How many current customers do you have, how many warehouses (and where are they), and who’s on the executive team?</li>
<li class="p1">Which shipping carriers do you work with? Do you handle international shipping? What are your rates?</li>
<li class="p1">What fees do you charge? What about the “hidden” ones?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you have in-house IT and hardware repair specialists to make sure all software and equipment is running smoothly?</li>
<li class="p1">When is your cut-off time? What about operating hours?</li>
<li class="p1">What sort of value-added services, such as kitting and SKU management, do you offer?</li>
<li class="p1">What software do you use for inventory management purposes, and can you integrate on the back end of my company’s ecommerce platform? (Magento, SquareSpace, Shopify, etc.)</li>
<li class="p1">Do I sign a month-to-month contract or is it long-term?</li>
<li class="p1">How much of the U.S. can you reach within two days via ground shipping? Three days?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you provide email notifications to customers when an item has shipped?</li>
<li class="p1">Can you guarantee that you won’t ever be responsible for delayed, damaged, or lost items?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Download The Questionnaire</h3></p>
<p class="p1">If you’d like a thorough questionnaire, here’s a helpful <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/roots/assets/pdf/Fulfillment_Provider_Questionnaire_-_RSF_Answers.pdf">printable resource</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">Once you have the answers to these questions, analyze whether the provider looks like a good option. If they do, it would be wise to visit the fulfillment facility and see it for yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, it can’t hurt to do a split test. Ask for a 30-day trial period with two, or even three different fulfillment centers so you can compare them head-to-head and decide which one is best for your business.</p>
<p class="p1">By following these guidelines, businesses will be able to find a 3PL that helps their business scale up, improve profit margins, and deliver high-quality products to their customers.</p>
<p class="p1">While a 3PL is the right solution for many businesses, there are some cases where establishing your own product distribution may be advantageous. Let’s take a closer look at what is involved in this third technique and when it’s a good idea.</p>
<h2 class="p7">When to Establish Your Own Product Distribution</h2>
<p class="p1">The reality is, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/target-market-analysis/">your target market</a> may not leave drop-shipping or a third-party fulfillment partnership as viable options.</p>
<p class="p1">If your ecommerce store sells high-end, one-off, leather briefcases with custom lining, unique pocket placements, and tailored embroidery, then your business model is simply not suited for sending pallets of your product off to a fulfillment warehouse.</p>
<p class="p1">When Kayde Johnson-Anderson first founded <a href="http://www.shoplabu.com/">LaBu</a>, her goal was to create a successful side business, selling handcrafted jewelry and home goods.</p>
<p class="p10"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21284" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-la-bu.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-la-bu.png 1439w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-la-bu-300x157.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-la-bu-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Like many other startups, Kayde set up her fulfillment operation from her home in California in order to have easy access to photographing new products being added to the store and to be able to ensure adequate packaging for her first orders.</p>
<p class="p1">While Kayde has recently gone full-time operating and growing the online store, she knows she’s not quite to the point where hiring her first full-time employee to handle the pick, pack, and ship operations is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.blacknbianco.com/">Black n Bianco</a>, an online store selling children’s formal wear, started out as a retail store in California before launching its BigCommerce shop online.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-black-bianco.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21283" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-black-bianco.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-black-bianco.png 1439w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-black-bianco-300x157.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-black-bianco-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">When sales began to fall for the brick-and-mortar storefront, the Black n Bianco team decided to focus on developing the company’s online presence by expanding to multiple sales channels and marketplaces, including Sears, eBay, and Kmart.</p>
<p class="p1">Robert, the company’s web manager, explained that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“managing the inventory of a brick-and-mortar store, along with the retail store, meant that we had most of the assets (including two full-time employees to handle picking and packing) in place to handle our own fulfillment. That said, using order fulfillment software tools like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/channeladvisor/">ChannelAdvisor</a> to manage inventory across multiple platforms was a critical feature we were missing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">As businesses grow, many companies choose to vertically integrate their operations with a desire to cut costs and maintain a higher level of control over processes. This can be a great business decision for a company, but with a capital-intensive investment such as an in-house fulfillment operation, businesses should wholly evaluate the total cost of such an endeavor.</p>
<p class="p1">Understanding <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/which-online-businesses-benefit-from-the-use-of-a-fulfillment-center/">which online businesses benefit from a fulfillment partner</a>, versus keeping operations in-house, is a critical evaluation step that should be thoroughly carried out before buying warehouse space. Let’s take a look at some of the issues that could be faced starting your own in-house fulfillment operation.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Understanding the Costs of Self-Fulfillment: Both Financial &amp; Time</h2>
<p class="p1">For bigger businesses looking to establish their own fulfillment operation (also called “direct order fulfillment”), the sheer number of costs and new liabilities can be overwhelming when setting up your own fulfillment center.</p>
<p class="p1">Below, we’ve outlined some of the primary consideration to look into.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Land &amp; Warehouse Space</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Rental Rate: $4 to $14 (per sq. ft.)</h4>
<p class="p1">Besides the base square footage cost, the term length of your lease contract is another primary issue to consider.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Tax implications</h4>
<p class="p1">Having a physical presence may change your requirement to charge sales tax to your customers. See the BigCommerce guide on ecommerce<a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-sales-tax/"> sales taxes</a> for more information on navigating the spider web of state taxes.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Location</h4>
<p class="p1">If your ecommerce store is purchasing or leasing warehouse space, chances are you’re looking in your immediate area. Check back to our earlier section, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jd9Oq1kSm18iHvepFqh1ZRsj0ju5pFBra4eliW6ABmE/edit#heading=h.rt1uky9qmfrk">Location of Your Fulfillment Partner</a>, for a guide on how to evaluate the best location for your product distribution.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s also fairly unlikely that you’ll have multiple warehouses of your own, at least at first. If you’re located on one of the coasts or one extreme corner of the country, you need to weight the increased cost of shipping your orders to customers further away, as well as the extended time it may take for your customers to receive an order. Ask yourself, “How valuable is being able to reach all of my customers in two days?”</p>
<h3 class="p4">Operational Capital Expenditures</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Pallet Racking:</strong> $50 to $80 per pallet position (not including installation)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Forklifts:</strong> $800 to $1,100 per Month</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Trailer loading docks:</strong> $250,000 per Dock</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Conveyors</strong>: Belted ($150 to $200 per foot), Gravity ($50 to $120 per foot.)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Computers/Tablets/Phones:</strong> (for integration with new warehouse management software) $1,000+</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p4">Software</h3>
<p class="p1">Figuring out what software tools are needed to plug in with your BigCommerce store and manage with warehouse operations can be a daunting task.</p>
<p class="p1">Platforms such as <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shiphero/">ShipHero</a> can be a lifesaver versus the time and expense of trying to create your own software program. Furthermore, software solutions such as <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/skubana/">Skubana</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shipstation/">ShipStation</a> are a great if you need to consolidate orders from multiple storefronts or marketplaces, or sync availability with a drop-shipper or third-party fulfillment partner.</p>
<p class="p1">Other apps, such as <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/aftership/">AfterShip</a>, can be a lifesaver by passing all parcel tracking information along to your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">The necessary software solutions exist in the BigCommerce App store. Sure, there’s usually a monthly or per-order cost associated with each one, but the real cost to consider is the day-to-day managing of integrations between multiple apps, your storefront, and your customers, which in itself can create a need for a new full-time tech guru at your company.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Workforce</h3>
<p class="p1">How easy will it be for you to hire and train (plus training materials and SOP documentation) a workforce to run your warehouse? You may only need two or three additional people, but depending on the size of your existing workforce, an increase in headcount could have <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/answers/we-are-about-to-hit-50-employees-what-are-some-of-the-hr-compliance-areas-i-should-consider/">other implications on your business</a>.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Seasonality</h4>
<p class="p1">If you’re going to be hiring new people, you need to have a plan in place to deal with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/holiday-hiring-help-how-to-find-quality-employees-for-the-holiday-rush/">seasonality, particularly around the holidays</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Shipping Rate Discounts with Carriers</h3>
<p class="p1">Negotiating your own shipping discounts can be a hard mountain to climb, but once established, these discounts can serve as a competitive advantage and even an additional profit center for your business.</p>
<p class="p1">The primary factor when weighing your negotiating power is your monthly order volume</p>
<p class="p1">The more you ship, the more negotiating power you’ll have with carriers. A secondary factor is the weight distribution of your volume.</p>
<p class="p1">If the majority of your outbound parcels are within a 5-pound weight bracket, this concentration of volume can help you earn the best discounts where it will save you the most money. Keep in mind that thanks to the ongoing changes to <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/dimensional-weight-calculator/">dimensional weight</a>, your 3-pound container of protein may actually end up being billed at 7 or 8 pounds.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, for businesses who have low volume, or whose volume is spread thin across the weight tables, a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/#cmtoc_anchor_id_2">profitable ecommerce shipping strategy</a> may be hard to establish.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Changes to Core Competency</h3>
<p class="p1">The biggest question to ask is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Will setting up my own fulfillment operation give me a unique competitive advantage?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Going back to Craig Rabin’s example with the launch of <a href="https://theairhook.com/">The AirHook</a>, when your ecommerce store hits it big and sees a massive uptick in orders, it’s critical that you take advantage of this positive trend and fulfill orders in such a way that your customers’ expectations are exceeded (or, at a minimum, met), in order to ensure a continued relationship with these customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Often, this means offering free two-day shipping, with orders shipped on the same day, 100% perfectly picked orders, and fast return processing.</p>
<p class="p1">For most ecommerce stores, these areas of focus are outside the core competencies that created the growth in order volume in the first place. Since <a href="https://theairhook.com/">The AirHook</a> only sells a single product in a handful of different colors, Craig is able to manage the month-to-month domestic order fulfillment following the KickStarter surge.</p>
<p class="p1">But for ecommerce stores with hundreds or even thousands of SKUs, a valuable third-party fulfillment provider is a critical partnership to have to ensure that your time is spent handling the primary drivers of your business, such as <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/content-marketing-ecommerce-traffic/">growing your online traffic</a>, or carrying out <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/visual-merchandising/">innovative new marketing tactics</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p7">Final Word</h3>
<p class="p1">Now that you understand the three main options for ecommerce fulfillment — including when to use them and how to get started — you’re ready to take a look at your business and decide which is the best fit.</p>
<p class="p1">The first step is to understand what your goals are if you’re evaluating a new fulfillment technique.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Are you looking to improve your warehouse/pick, pack, ship efficiency?</li>
<li class="p1">Are you looking to save on shipping cost?</li>
<li class="p1">Are you looking to expand your product offerings?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Also, understand what stage your business is in, and where you hope a new order fulfillment model will help to evolve.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Are you a startup on a lean budget looking to start making sales? Or an established business that wants to test out a new market?
<ul>
<li class="p1">Is your goal to grow your business over the next 5 years and then sell the company? Or are you long-term focused and looking to find a fulfilment partner that can enable your company to grow for decades?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1">For medium-sized businesses that already have demand for their products or services and have the capital to invest in inventory, 3PLs are a great fit. You can outsource all of the hassle to experts, increase your profit margins, and focus on the parts of your business that will impact your bottom line the most.</li>
<li class="p1">Lastly, if your online store specializes in high-end speciality items, self-fulfillment is often the way to go. Just understand all that’s involved from a time and capital perspective before committing to this model.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The right solution for you is going to depend on what type of product or services you are selling and where your business is in its development.</p>
<p class="p1">Keep this guide on hand to refer back to and identify the right technique based on your unique situation. If you have any questions, send them over in the comments section below.</p>
<p class="p1">Order fulfillment is a truly integrated part of your supply chain that all other business aspects depend on, so choose wisely!</p>

<ol>
<li>Get people to visit your store.</li>
<li>Do everything in your power to turn those visitors into customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The former usually requires a fair chunk of time and money, which puts even more emphasis and importance on the latter.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to just have quality products and a good-looking storefront: you need to engage your visitors and stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways online stores engage customers is with popups and banners. These on-screen interactions aren’t so different from a sale sign in the front window of a brick-and-mortar store, or a sales clerk asking if you’d like to join their loyalty program.</p>
<p>Popups aren’t a recent invention, of course.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/">The first popup ad</a> flashed onto the scene in the mid-’90s, and since then online marketers have weighed the downsides of using popups — annoying customers, interrupting user experience, even slowing down page speeds — with the fact that <strong>popups are really, really effective</strong>.</p>
<p>How effective?</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>One study found that switching from a sidebar form to a lightbox-style popup design increased email signups by 1,375%.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>One study found that switching from a sidebar form to a lightbox-style popup <a href="https://blog.aweber.com/email-marketing/easy-secret-more-subscribers.htm">increased email signups by 1,375%</a>. Another business tried using a popup to capture email signups and saw a <a href="https://thrivethemes.com/10x-increase-case-study/">10x increase in subscription rate</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a fan or not, using popups is a surefire way of attracting visitors’ attention, whether it’s to collect an email address, promote a sale, or something else. Even the ugliest popups generally convert well — which is why nearly every website uses them.</p>
<p>While popups aren’t a new phenomenon, what is relatively recent is the development and proliferation of more elegant, more manageable popup solutions.</p>
<p>In 2017, not only do users expect to see popups when they visit websites, but marketers, including online store owners, have tools for creating popups that look great and serve their customers’ interests.</p>
<p>That last point is key to using popups well, and it’s something we’ll expand on later in this post when we share some best practices for using popups in your store.</p>
<p>For now, just remember that <strong>popups should always offer the customer a benefit</strong>. As an online store owner, if you don’t have a mutually beneficial reason for showing a popup, then it’s probably not worth it.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>If you don’t have a mutually beneficial reason for showing a popup to a customer, then it’s not worth it.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>When we designed <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/pixelpop-popups-banners-with-exit-intent/">Pixelpop</a>, our goal was to give online businesses a way of doubling down on the world-class customer experience we had in mind when we designed <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">all 67 Stencil themes currently in the BigCommerce theme store</a>. We wanted to help merchants get the most out of every person who visits their store, whether that means converting them into sales now or collecting their email to increase the chance of converting them in the future.</p>
<p>In the end, we built a popup app that’s incredibly easy to use, and that makes it easy for any store owner to create an assortment of <a href="https://blog.justuno.com/10-inspiring-examples-of-email-pop-up-designs-and-why-they-work">great-looking popup designs</a> and banners designed to engage visitors, boost conversions, and drive sales.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we’ve thought a lot about what it means to create a winning engagement strategy, from the popup types and options you should consider, to exactly how to match your popup to your brand and BigCommerce theme.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll share what we’ve learned and give you the tools necessary to make sure you’re engaging every visitor in the best way possible.</p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Get Started Now</h3></p>
<p>Check out Pixelpop in the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/pixelpop-popups-banners-with-exit-intent/">BigCommerce App Store</a>.</p>
<p></div>
<h2>Rule #1. Start collecting email addresses</h2>
<p>If you’re already doing this, kudos! You’re off to a great start.</p>
<p>If not, now is the time to add Pixelpop to your store (it takes two seconds) and create an email signup popup. Go on, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/pixelpop-popups-banners-with-exit-intent/">add the app right now</a>. We’ll be here when you come back.</p>
<p>Here’s what it should look like right before you launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-01.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21156" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-01.png" alt="pop up window" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-01.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-01-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-01-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>So why is collecting email addresses so important? For one thing, no matter how great your products are, no matter what special deals you’re offering, you’re never going to convert every shopper who visits your store.</p>
<p>The vast majority are going to poke around for a bit, see what you have to offer, and then bounce off in search of the next great deal.</p>
<p>By using an email signup popup, you give yourself a chance at re-engaging those visitors and selling to them in the future — not just once, but over and over again.</p>
<p>And if you’re one of those people who believe email marketing is dead? Consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thedma.org/blog/data-driven-marketing/saturday-stat-series/">66% of online customers</a> have completed a purchase as a result of a marketing email</li>
<li>Email prompts purchases at <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/emarketer-review-key-2013-trends-coverage-areas-platform-growth/">3 times the rate</a> of social media</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/data/public/reports/benchmark-reports/EXCERPT-BMR-2013-Email-Marketing.pdf">72% of people</a> prefer to receive promotional content through email (compared to 17% who prefer social media)</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is, if you’re not using a popup to collect email addresses, you’re missing out on a big opportunity and an even bigger chunk of sales.</p>
<p>In 10 minutes, you can create an email signup popup and sync it to MailChimp or Conversio so that signups are automatically added to your mailing list of choice. If you use a different email service provider, you can also download a CSV file with collected email addresses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-02.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21157" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-02.png" alt="ecommerce pop up design" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-02.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-02-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-02-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Easily style your pop-up to fit your brand and needs. </em></p>
<p>When the busy shopping periods hit and it becomes even more expensive to acquire traffic, you’ll be glad to have a list of customers who are familiar with your brand and products, who you can target with specialized sales and offers.</p>
<h2>Rule #2. Run popups with planned campaigns</h2>
<p>Pixelpop supports more than just email signups. In fact, it offers 7 popup types in total:</p>
<ol>
<li>Email Signup</li>
<li>Announcement</li>
<li>Page Promotion</li>
<li>Coupon Code</li>
<li>Social Follow</li>
<li>Custom Image</li>
<li>Cookie Disclaimer</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, you’re obviously not going to run all of these things at once, but you can pick and choose what and when to promote, and how to work popups into your various campaigns.</p>
<h3>Free Shipping Banners &amp; Popups</h3>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">if you offer free shipping</a>, it’s always a good idea to announce that loud and proud at the top or bottom of the page. BigCommerce themes offer a built-in banner area that works well for this, but its customization is rather limited compared to the diversity of options supported by Pixelpop.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-03.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21158" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-03.png" alt="how to create popups" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-03.png 2516w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-03-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-03-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can see the <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Creating-Editing-Banners">built-in BigCommerce banner</a> at the bottom of the above screenshot.</em></p>
<p>To create a shipping banner that really grabs customers’ attention, you’ll need a solution from the app store. There are standalone apps dedicated to this functionality, but with Pixelpop all you need to do is create an announcement popup and select “bar” when picking your shape.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-04.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21159" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-04.png" alt="create a pop up with Pixelpop" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-04.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-04-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-04-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Pixelpop version of a banner on a BigCommerce store. These can replace the out-of-the-box banners. </em></p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Can you afford to offer free shipping?</h3></p>
<p>If you don’t offer free shipping, you should take a moment to consider if it could be a good option for your store. Start by <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.ca/ecommerce-answers/what-average-order-value/">calculating your average order value</a> for the past few months, increase that by 10-20%, and try offering free shipping on any order over that amount.</p>
<p></div>
<h3>Sales &amp; Promotion Banners &amp; Popups</h3>
<p>Similar to free shipping, if you’re running a holiday sale or any other promotion, you’ll want to make sure visitors know about it the moment they land on your page.</p>
<p>Using a page promotion popup, you can direct traffic to a featured or discounted product page, or even a special piece of content like a sales page or gift guide.</p>
<p>Here’s an example view while the pop-up is in build mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-05.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21160" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-05.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-05.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-05-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-05-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3>Coupon Code Banners &amp; Popups</h3>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>96% of U.S. shoppers say they look for and use coupons.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>The coupon code popup is also ideal for promotions, as it displays a coupon code that visitors can use to get a discount at checkout. (And if you don’t believe in coupons, consider the <a href="http://retailmenot.mediaroom.com/2014-09-08-We-Are-a-Coupon-Nation">96% of U.S. shoppers</a> who report using coupons!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-06.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21161" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-06.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-06.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-06-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-06-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can create pop-ups that take up the entire screen, but still mesh with your brand. </em></p>
<p>Versatility was key when we were designing Pixelpop. We wanted to give merchants an all-in-one tool they could use in conjunction with every campaign, whether that meant building their mailing list, getting more social followers, or clearing out inventory with a weekend sale.</p>
<p>If you’re doing something special for your store, don’t just sit back and expect customers to find out about it. Create a popup and deliver your message loud and clear.</p>
<h2>Rule #3. Time your popups effectively</h2>
<p>Before publishing a popup, review the settings available and make sure each popup is appearing in the right place, at the right time. Pixelpop offers a range of scheduling and delay options, which you can use to refine your engagement strategy.</p>
<p>Here is what that interface looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-07.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21162" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-07.png" alt="" width="640" height="294" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-07.png 1348w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-07-300x138.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-07-750x345.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-08.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21163" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-08.png" alt="" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-08.png 1572w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-08-300x199.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-08-750x499.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Scheduling is simple enough — choose a start and end date for your popup window to appear — but there’s plenty of room for finesse when it comes to delays.</p>
<p>With Pixelpop, you have your choice of several types of delays, including page delays (number of pages viewed), scroll delays (percentage of page scrolled), timed delays (amount of time spent on page), and every online marketer’s favorite: exit-intent delays (we’ll explain those in a sec).</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>Using a slight delay gives potential customers a chance to see what your store is offering before you try to sign them up for anything.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>In the case of sales and special offers, you generally want to show those popups as soon as possible, which means not using any delays. However, with other popups, such as email signups and coupon code offers, it can be better to hold off for a little bit.</p>
<p>Using a page delay of 2-5 pages, using a scroll delay of 60-70%, or using a timed delay of 10-20 seconds is a good way of letting your visitors look around before asking for their email address. Using a slight delay gives potential customers a chance to see what your store is offering before you try to sign them up for anything.</p>
<h3>Exit-Intent Popups</h3>
<p>Delaying a coupon code popup is a similar way of building incentive, and it’s also a perfect use case for the much-ballyhooed exit-intent popup. If you haven’t heard of these little beauties, basically what they do is wait until the last possible moment before the visitor is about to leave your store, and then pop onto the scene in all their conversion-driving glory.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-09.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21164" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-09.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-09.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-09-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-09-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The reason exit-intent works so well with coupon code popups (and email signups, for that matter) is because you give the visitor the maximum amount of time to get interested in your products without interrupting their experience, and then, right when they’re about to leave, you get a perfect opportunity to convert them.</p>
<p>In a brick-and-mortar world, that would be like having a clairvoyant sales associate who knows exactly how long to leave the customer on their own before engaging them with an offer.</p>
<p>So how effective are exit-intent delays?</p>
<p>Consider that the current global cart abandonment rate hovers <a href="https://www.listrak.com/digital-marketing-automation/multichannel-marketing-solutions/email-marketing/shopping-cart-abandonment-index.aspx">somewhere around 77%</a>. Studies have shown that exit-intent offers can recover a significant chunk of lost sales by convincing shoppers to stick around or come back later with a special coupon code or email marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Try creating a coupon code popup in the shape of a “full-screen takeover,” enable exit-intent to offer customers a 10% discount, and see what kind of conversion lift you get.</p>

<p></div>
<h2>Rule #4. Use advanced targeting for even better results</h2>
<p>Speaking of refining your engagement strategy, you can tailor popups for certain audience segments. If you want to only show it to people from a certain country, or only on certain pages, or only to people arriving from a certain email campaign — more power to you.</p>
<p>There’s lots you can do with Pixelpop’s targeting options. If you want to customize your messaging or offers for different global audiences, or run regional sales based around national holidays (Cinco de Mayo sale, anyone?), you can enable geo-targeting with the “Target by location” option.</p>
<p>Here is what that interface looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-10.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21165" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-10.png" alt="" width="640" height="372" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-10.png 1373w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-10-300x174.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-10-750x435.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>If you want to draw attention to a sale on a individual product, you can create a special popup that appears only on that product page using the “Target By Page” option.</p>
<p>Again, here is what that interface looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-11.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21166" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-11.png" alt="" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-11.png 1375w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-11-300x197.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-11-750x492.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>One highly effective way you can use advanced targeting is with the <em>“Target By URL/UTM Parameter”</em> option. What this means is the popup will only show to customers arriving at your site from a specified URL (or partial URL).</p>
<p>If your customer is arriving from an email or ad campaign, you can use a banner or popup to welcome them to your site and reiterate an offer or promote a product they’ve seen before. This creates a more cohesive link between your emails, ads, promotions, etc. and your online store – and often increases conversions.</p>
<p>And again, what the interface looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-12.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21167" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-12.png" alt="" width="640" height="412" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-12.png 1373w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-12-300x193.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-12-750x482.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Next time you send an email to your mailing list, create an accompanying popup with a coupon for 10% off as a thanks for being a loyal subscriber, and add a UTM parameter which you can then paste into your targeting options.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you’re running an ad with a specific product featured in it, create a popup on your store advertising a discount on that product, and then attach a UTM parameter to both your ad and your popup’s targeting options.</p>
<h2>Rule #5. Match your popups to your theme</h2>
<p>One of the best things about Pixelpop is its rich, easy-to-use popup editor that lets you pick from a range of popup themes and custom fonts, colors, shapes, sizes, and styles. A live preview lets you see how your popup looks in your store as you edit it, including the option to preview what it looks like on mobile devices and tablets.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-13.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21168 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-13.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-13.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-13-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-13-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Easily customize your pop-up to match your site’s theme and branding across all devices.</em></p>
<p>If you’re a Stencil user, all the better, because now is a good time to remind you that Pixel Union, the ecommerce design agency behind Pixelpop, is the same team that designed <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">all 67 themes currently available in the BigCommerce Theme Store</a>.</p>
<p>What that means is you’re working with the very same design ethos that went into creating your BigCommerce storefront. Not only that, but you have access to Pixel Union’s customer support team, the same nice folks you would contact if you ever needed help with your theme.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re a Blueprint user, don’t despair:</strong> Pixelpop is fully compatible with all Blueprint themes, and its versatility makes it easy to boost engagement with a popup that matches your store.</p>
<h3>Which Popup Styles to Use with Your Stencil Theme</h3>
<p>On that note, picking the right popup design for your store is important. Take an image-heavy theme like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/geneva-bold/">Geneva</a> or <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/lookbook-standard/">Lookbook</a>, for example. To complement its full-width design, you’ll want a clean, crisp popup that doesn’t detract from your beautiful product photography. A solid black or white background, depending on the tone of your images, is always a good call.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-14.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21169" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-14.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-14.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-14-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-14-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>On the the other hand, if you use a more classic, grid-based theme like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/foundry-classic/">Foundry</a> or <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/venture-bright/">Venture</a>, you can be a bit more daring in your popup design. You still want it to complement the page’s fonts and colors, but don’t be afraid to design a popup that grabs the customer’s attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-15.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21170" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-15.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-15.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-15-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-15-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Also think about where on the page your popups appear and how that will affect your theme. If you use a theme like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/merchant-classic/">Merchant</a>, which has a modal-shaped feature area and CTA button designed right into the carousel, avoid modal-shaped homepage popups and stick to bars, cards, and full-screen takeovers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-16.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21171" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-16.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-16.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-16-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-16-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Conversely, a dual-column theme like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/capacity-bright/">Capacity</a> is perfect for a nicely designed modal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-17.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21172" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-17.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-17.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-17-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-17-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Pixelpop’s full-screen editor features a color picker with hex code support so you can easily implement your brand’s color scheme. Every popup theme also comes with an assortment of hand-picked font options, so you can find one that complements your theme.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-18.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21173" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-18.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-18.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-18-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-18-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>At the end of the day, you’ll dramatically improve your customers’ experience and build trust by making sure your popups look professional and match the look and feel of your store.</p>
<h2>Rule #6. Follow best practices for creating popups</h2>
<p>Before we sign off with our final call to go try our popup maker, Pixelpop, (that one doesn’t count), we thought we’d lay down a few final ground rules or best practices for using popups.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep your messaging clear and succinct.</strong> We could easily have included this as part of the last rule, as succinct copy has a lot to do with good design. Do everything you can to avoid having your copy go on for more than a couple of lines. More importantly, make sure your messaging is clear, engaging, and consistent with your brand’s voice. Don’t be afraid to be funny!</li>
<li><strong>Don’t clutter the page with popups.</strong> How would you like to visit an online store and find popup ads popping up all over the place? Well, neither would your customers. As a rule, stick to a maximum of two popups on any given page, and never use the same shape twice on a single page. Bar-shaped popups are the easiest to pair with additional popups.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate with a mailing service like MailChimp or Conversio.</strong> Who wants to deal with CSV files and manual imports and exports? Not us. Connect your Email Signup popup to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/mailchimp/">MailChimp</a> or <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/conversio/">Conversio</a> to have all new signups be automatically synced to your mailing list of choice.</li>
<li><strong>Test it, including on mobile.</strong> Whatever popup solution you’re using, don’t make the mistake of publishing a popup without testing it first. That means double-checking links and checking to see how it looks on mobile. Pixelpop’s live preview lets you see right in the editor how it will appear on tablet and mobile phones, which can save you a ton of time.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure it meets Google’s mobile-friendliness guidelines.</strong> On that note, if you didn’t hear, <a href="https://www.pixelunion.net/blog/google-mobile-popup-crackdown-online-store/">Google rolled out some changes to its algorithm</a> earlier this year with the goal of making the web more friendly to mobile users. Pixelpop’s “Google Mobile-Friendly” setting makes sure your popups comply with these new guidelines, automatically condensing your popups into bars when loaded on mobile devices, so you don’t need to worry about taking an SEO hit.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure it offers a benefit to the customer.</strong> We mentioned this near the start of the post, and truth be told, it’s the one piece of advice we want every merchant to keep in mind when creating popups for their store. If you’re going to disrupt a visitor’s browsing experience, you should make sure you’re doing it in a way that will make them say “Thanks!” and not “Go away!”</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, there are lots of ways you can engage visitors in a mutually beneficial way — offering a discount or special promotion, telling them about a product they might find interesting, linking to a piece of content you’ve written to help them find what they’re looking for, and so on.</p>
<p>At their core, popups are a way of bringing you closer to your customers — giving you what you both want, and making everyone happy.</p>

Even if you only had $1,000 to invest in 1997, today you’d have more than $626,000.</p>
<p class="p1">But who could have predicted back then that an online bookstore would, in two decades time, become one of the world’s most dominant online stores –– offering everything from the books they started with to the high-end fashion that resisted for so long?</p>
<p class="p1">20 years ago, there were a measly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/01/business/money-starts-to-show-in-internet-shopping.html">40 million people</a> using the internet in the U.S., and online sales generated only $2.4 billion. In 2017, more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2237/internet-usage-in-the-united-states/">287 million people in the U.S. alone</a> use the internet –– and online sales are expected to hit <a href="http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/report-online-retail-sales-hit-0-billion-01">$440 billion by year end</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">That is an 18,650% increase in global internet usage and an 18,233% increase in online sales.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Since 1997, there has been a 18,650% increase in global internet usage and an 18,233% increase in online sales.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Amazon’s stock price has risen in equal measure, from $18 in 1997 to around $948 at the time of writing –– a 5,166% increase.</p>
<p class="p1">This is no chicken and egg problem –– clearly the internet and online sales came first. But these days, it’s hard to tell whether Amazon grows larger as the internet and online sales do, or if the internet and online sales grow larger as Amazon does.</p>
<p class="p1">Either way, the relationship is symbiotic, and though for much of Amazon’s history small business and other verticalized online sellers made an enemy of the marketplace, <a href="https://www.junglescout.com/bright-future-for-amazon-sellers/">those tides are very quickly changing</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">After all, as the ecommerce industry hits one milestone after the other –– so, too, does Amazon.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Ecommerce + Amazon Facts and Stats</h2>
<p class="p1">You might feel the quickening pace at which ecommerce adoption and innovation is hitting market.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your business may be having to turn to online for inbound sales in an industry where business has historically been conducted over the phone.</li>
<li class="p1">Or perhaps you are now having to look to AI to implement new buyer journeys for Gen Z purchasers.</li>
<li class="p1">Or perhaps you simply feel the pressure to give your shoppers the options for free or two-day shipping –– just to compete in today’s competitive ecommerce market.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You are not wrong in that feeling. The innovative steps and measures taken today by online brands are part of an ongoing story about modern human convenience and the technology we wield to achieve it.</p>
<p class="p1">And Amazon has been a large part of the story for 20 years. Let’s take a look.</p>

<h2 class="p3">The Converging of Retail</h2>
<p class="p1">As you can see, 2016 was a pivotal year for online brands when it came to sentiment about selling on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, as the world’s 5th largest company, online brands have come to understand that trying to compete with Amazon is not an effective business strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, these brands have turned to finding ways to leverage the marketplace to their advantage –– growing sales and driving revenue through channels beyond their webstore.</p>
<p class="p1">Looking only at BigCommerce merchants, we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">20% of BigCommerce customers have connected their websites to at least one additional channel, like Amazon.</li>
<li class="p1">Of merchants who have enabled Amazon, roughly 12% of cumulative GMV comes through Amazon.</li>
<li class="p1">According to a recent survey of BigCommerce merchants, 73% of SMBs are considering expanding to sell on Amazon or eBay in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">The Amazon Timeline</h2>
<p class="p1">Here is what the past 20 years look like, visually, as Amazon and other online brands converge –– offering merchants additional product options, prices and convenience at every step along the way.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21068" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic.jpg" alt="amazon timeline" width="500" height="2950" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic.jpg 500w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic-300x1770.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">What does this mean for your brand?</h2>
<p class="p1">Selling on Amazon may not be the right choice for all brands –– depending on the products you sell and the stage of growth you are in.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s look at a few ways to determine whether your brand is ready to sell on Amazon.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Offer Unique Items, Not Third-Party</h3>
<p class="p1">According to James Thomson, Partner at the Buy Box Experts and former Head of Selling on Amazon, the products that do best on Amazon are unique items. This means goods you manufacture and sell yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is a short list of BigCommerce merchants <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-success-stories/">selling successfully</a> both on their webstore and on Amazon to give you an idea of what “unique products” means:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Dazadi</li>
<li class="p1">Austin Bazaar</li>
<li class="p1">Kap7</li>
<li class="p1">The Dairy Fairy</li>
<li class="p1">BeachRC</li>
<li class="p1">Folding Chairs and Tables</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">In general, if you both make and sell your own unique products, you are a good candidate for selling and succeeding on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Is Your Business a Good Fit for Amazon?</h3></p>
<p class="p1">In this piece, James Thomson gets in-depth about <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/what-to-know-before-selling-on-amazon/">who should (and more importantly, who should *not*) sell on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">Set Up Your Amazon Channel Right – The First Time</h3>
<p class="p1">There are plenty of nuances to successfully selling on Amazon, in the same way there are nuances to successfully selling on your webstore. Here are a few to watch out for:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Get your taxes in working orders:</strong> immediately upon signing up a new seller account, go into the Settings –&gt; Tax Settings, and designate not only in which states you want Amazon to collect state sales tax, but also set the “Use default Product Tax Code” setting to “A_GEN_TAX.”</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Measure profitability accurately:</strong> Don’t average everything out, and look only at your overall sales numbers and margins. Start thinking about every SKU you sell on Amazon as having its own P&amp;L, its own market forces, and its own level and types of competitions. Such an approach has helped many a seller rationalize its catalog, focusing on bottom line growth ahead of all other financial goals.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Look out for duplicate listings from competitors:</strong> Duplicate listings on Amazon can be an effective way for competitors to divert traffic away from your product listings back to theirs. It’s worth, at least once a quarter, to search the whole Amazon catalog for duplicate listings of your items.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Amazon Pitfalls and What You Need to Know Is Skip Right Over Them</h3></p>
<p class="p1">James Thomson is back at it again giving you all the dirty details to the most common selling on Amazon mistakes –– and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-selling-pitfalls-problems/">how to make sure you don’t make any of them</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">Know if You Need to Outsource</h3>
<p class="p1">If selling on Amazon is new for you, remember that you do not have to do all of the selling, setup or optimization by yourself. It may be worth it for your to hire a few outside and experienced sources to help you with tasks so you can focus on both your webstore and your Amazon channel growth.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ve put together a list of more than 230 companies that do just that, and sectioned them out by the service they offer and how to know you need them.</p>
<p class="p1">You can get the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-solution-provider-directory/">free directory</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Amazon-Directory-Solutions-Providers/dp/1544287208/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494445539&amp;sr=1-2">buy it on Amazon</a> to keep a physical copy on hand.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Looking to Optimize Your Amazon SEO?</h3></p>
<p class="p1">You’re in luck! Use our <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-asin-lookup-tool/">free ASIN Lookup tool</a> to figure out which keywords your competitors are using to rank highly on Amazon –– and then alter your strategy to boost your rankings (and your sales).</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">Sell What Works</h3>
<p class="p1">Folding Chairs and Tables now sees more than 10% of their revenue coming directly from Amazon –- and they’ve only been selling on Amazon a couple months.</p>
<p class="p1">How did they become so successful so fast?</p>
<p class="p1">By focusing on a single product they sell nowhere else on the web.</p>
<p class="p1">Using their BigCommerce Analytics, they were able to see which products sell the best together and offered a table + chairs listing combo on Amazon that immediately beat out other listings and drove increased sales to their brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, they are exploring additional product bundle launches on Amazon –– keeping their offerings on the marketplace and on their webstore different for the various audiences that shop on either one.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">If your brand is a fit to sell on Amazon, start doing so now. Amazon isn’t going anywhere –– and as they expand to additional markets and continue to invest in the latest and greatest in ecommerce innovation, your brand and products will be right there along for the ride.</p>
<p class="p1">20 years ago, had you invested, you’d be half a million dollars richer. Don’t let the opportunity pass you by again.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">You’ve reached the tipping point.</p>
<p class="p1">One last major site outage. One bug undetected for months that could have cost you millions (but you thankfully caught!). One more feature that will cost way too much and take much too long to build. One last peak season losing sleep wondering if the infrastructure will hold this time around.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-platforms/">It’s time to switch ecommerce platforms</a>. It’s time to get it right this time. It’s time to empower your brand to focus on marketing and selling your goods, not on being technologists just trying to keep your site alive.</p>
<p class="p1">Now what?</p>
<p class="p1">It’s time to find the right fit for your unique business, which means it&#8217;s <a href="https://saleswarp.com/selecting-a-new-ecommerce-platform-the-rfp-process/">time to issue an RFP</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">An RFP (Request for Proposal) standardizes your evaluation criteria across the 3-5 select vendors you choose to send it to. It effectively puts every platform out there on an equal playing field. You are, after all, asking each vendor the same questions. You can then benchmark answers directly against one another –– without any sales chatter to trip you up.</p>
<p class="p1">Implied in this is something rather simple: if you don’t send an RFP, each vendor will likely sell you on what they have –– removing your ability to judge each platform effectively across the business critical requirements of your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">RFPs help you minimize the number of platforms you bring into phase 2 of <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration/">your re-platforming project</a>: platform demo presentations. Simply by a vendor responding to an RFP, you are clearly shortlisting which solution will work best for your unique requirements, which vendor took the process seriously and which have already committed to winning your business.</p>
<p class="p1">But RFPs aren’t easy. They aren’t designed to be. The questions you want to ask each vendor span internal departments and needs –– and even within those have various prioritizations.</p>
<p class="p1">To help you begin this process as easily as possible, my team is giving away the templatized RFP we offer to large merchants we speak with who are just beginning on this journey.</p>
<h2 class="p3">How to Use an RFP</h2>
<p class="p1">When handing this document off to brands, I typically accompany it with a few best practices to help them navigate the waters. Here’s what I share with them.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>The effort a vendor puts into the RFP is also a signal of their commitment to your requirements.</strong> So, pay attention to the quality of responses you get. Make sure the platforms you speak with are putting some skin in the game.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>In the RFP itself, there is a column of priority.</strong> That’s the first column after the question. For that part, be sure to get internal sign off on which aspects are business critical and which others might not be as important. This will help you to determine the right platform for your needs, and guide the platforms you send the RFP to on which items are the most important to properly explain. Be sure the priorities are set right for each question before you send it off.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use this as a starting point.</strong> Please personalize it to your business requirements. There might be migration questions that are not relevant to you and there might be questions missing that might be important to your business. Look through each section and confirm that these are your most business critical requirements. Be sure the priorities are set right for each question &#8211; BEFORE you send it off.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>This is an RFP template that helps you to get started.</strong> It is definitely best accompanied with a cover letter with further details on pricing needs and services requirements. Traditionally, this part is done in a Word document, not Excel, and includes business scope, pricing expectations and service requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Here are the 188 questions you’ll want clarity on before you begin to narrow down your ecommerce platform choices when approaching a migration.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="750" height="383" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BC_PS.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BC_PS.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BC_PS-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p class="p1">Ecommerce as we once knew it no longer exists. Gone are the days in which brands had the luxury of choosing which selling channel best fit their specific needs. While today you can still opt to focus more intently on a specific channel, for the most part, the most <a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/the-most-successful-retailers-are-increasingly-omnichannel/">successfully scaling retailers</a> are those which place products in front of customers, no matter where they are.</p>
<p class="p1">This often means that a brand must strategically utilize all channels –– or what many in the commerce industry call maintaining an “<a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/omnichannel-increasing-product-discoverability">omnichannel presence</a>” –– including hosting operations via a brick-and-mortar location, an ecommerce site, social commerce and marketplace participation with giants like Amazon, eBay, Rakuten and Jet.com.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>The channels with the steepest learning curves are marketplaces –– specifically eBay and Amazon.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=The+channels+with+the+steepest+learning+curves+are+marketplaces+%E2%80%93%E2%80%93+specifically+eBay+and+Amazon.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/the-inside-scoop-on-ebay-channel-management-proven-to-save-time-increase-sales/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">In a nutshell, everything is commerce these days. And while that may mean your business has the unique opportunity to capitalize on actively shopping audiences, you first need to ensure that your time spent with each channel is worth the investment. In other words, you need to get each channel up and running efficiently before you can confidently push shoppers to those brand extensions.</p>
<p class="p1">For many mid-market brands, the channels with the steepest learning curves are marketplaces –– specifically eBay and Amazon. Luckily, there are software solutions out there which have been built entirely around these channels with one goal in mind: to ease the complexity.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href="http://info.bigcommerce.com/amazon-solution-provider-directory">230+ Amazon Seller Software Solution Providers</a></em></p>
<p class="p1">Today, we’re highlighting one such company: inkFrog, an eBay channel manager and one of Bigcommerce’s most utilized applications within <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/">our marketplace</a>. The app helps to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Sync inventory between your online store and eBay</li>
<li class="p1">Manage your entire eBay business from one application</li>
<li class="p1">List to eBay using a template and profile builder</li>
<li class="p1">Manage multiple eBay IDs from one app</li>
<li class="p1">List to any eBay channel including eBay.com, eBay.ca, eBay.uk, eBay.au, eBay.de, eBay.fr, eBay.it, eBay.in, opening your business up to international opportunities</li>
<li class="p1">Manage auto relist and other post sale rules</li>
<li class="p1">Send/receive eBay messages directly from inside the application</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Below, we talk to three retailers about their inkFrog usage and how it has helped grow their business. Note: all of these stores sell both on Amazon and eBay. inkFrog is specifically for eBay listing management.</p>
<h3>Could you describe your experience using inkFrog?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>Richard Sault, Owner at <a href="http://www.saltdogcycling.com/">Salt Dog Cycling</a></em>: inkFrog is easy to use with the Bigcommerce and eBay integration, and the product page templates work well and are simple to set up. There are a few marketing tools which are also a bonus. Also, compared to some of the alternative applications, inkFrog is cheaper. It&#8217;s recently gone to a paid version, but it is still affordable and brings in a lot more business than the price of the app.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Kathy Ruddell, Owner at <a href="http://www.thenextbesthing.com/">The Next Best Thing</a></em>: [The application is] extremely easy to use. You can get your listing to a sales channel within a minute once all your templates are set up. And, my inventory [management] has been spot on.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Joe Peyton, Director of Marketing at Creative Play, which manages the online site <a href="https://www.foldingchairsandtables.com/">Folding Chairs and Tables</a></em>: We’ve been selling our products on eBay for several years. Prior to inkFrog, we were having to process orders from multiple channels. This app allows us to process orders from one area through Bigcommerce. We’ve been using InkFrog since it was originally a free app. Although it’s growth in popularity has required them to charge for the service, it’s still a wonderful app for our eBay order fulfillment.</p>
<h3>What are some of the main business benefits of using inkFrog?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>Sault</em>: I&#8217;m using inkFrog to sell on eBay and, at the same time, keep track of stock. I think it&#8217;s definitely one of the best apps on Bigcommerce and, turnover wise, we now do about the same [amount of business] on eBay as we do on the website –– although the fees on eBay are a big pain. Certain products sell better on eBay than they do on the website.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Ruddell</em>: The templates make the listing look more professional and it’s worth the small fee you pay to have your inventory in line.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Peyton</em>: The templates we’ve created through inkFrog allow us to quickly add, edit and remove products from eBay without needing to navigate through eBay’s website. Also, printing packing slips from eBay doesn’t provide us the branding we would like. inkFrog allows us to print customized packing slips with our logo on them so our customers know the company they ordered from on eBay.</p>
<h3>Do you have any advice to offer for those just getting started with the app or with the eBay marketplace in general?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>Sault, whose company uses eBay to push traffic back to the ecommerce site</em>: We integrate our eBay PayPal account with MailChimp to help collect customer email addresses so we can market the website. We&#8217;ve also added details like a phone number and website address in our eBay banner to try and get customers to buy from our website or a least take a look. It&#8217;s a tricky area on eBay using website addresses and phone numbers, but this is how we do it.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Ruddell</em>: Patience. It takes some time, but once you are a top rated seller, your products sell much faster.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Peyton</em>: Test different products. Consider the fees included when listing through eBay when figuring pricing. Unless you have an eBay store account, don’t list one product with multiple quantities. You’re limited by how much you can list so start with smaller quantities until you start to see certain products sell. Also, make sure to keep track of products with color or size variations that have quantities set on them so they don’t sell out.</p>
<h3>And finally, are there any other application and integrations you use for your Bigcommerce store?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>Sault</em>: The only other app I&#8217;m using on the website is <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/email-marketing-automation/">Remarkety</a>, which I think is good for keeping in touch with customers. It&#8217;s still fairly early days for us using this, so I don&#8217;t feel I can fully review it, but I think it&#8217;s good and we are building a few re-marketing campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Ruddell</em>: I haven’t really tried out very many, but I do use <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/sweet-tooth/">Sweet Tooth</a>. I love the free plan.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Peyton</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/yotpo-social-reviews/">Yotpo for product reviews</a>: We especially like how customers can post reviews straight from the email sent rather than clicking a link to another page to post a review.</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shipperhq/">ShipperHQ</a>: We ship a lot of freight, and we’ve used this app to integrate our carriers to display real time freight rates.</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/justuno/">JustUno</a>: This has increased our newsletter subscribers 300% since signing up.</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/stampscom-print-usps-shipping-labels/">Stamps.com</a>: We ship several orders by USPS each day and this app allows us to batch and print multiple shipment labels at once and automatically upload tracking. Saves us time.</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/sift-science/">Sift Science Fraud Prevention</a>: This app is fairly new for us, but helps rate and catch fraudulent orders. It has saved us from two fraudulent orders totaling over $4,000.</li>
</ul>

There are endless posts and theories about how to monetize Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and whatever flavor of the month network is getting press (i.e. Periscope, Snapchat, Vine, Quora, Reddit, etc). There’s social media fatigue setting in for many brand owners, retailers and marketers, and you can’t blame them. “Brand awareness” is a nebulous term, and its value is difficult to quantify, much less its ROI.</p>
<p class="p1">What social networks even matter? What social network isn’t resource intensive, isn’t likely to generate backlash from a flippant community manager, and offers a measurable return on investment? Pinterest.</p>
<h4>There are three major reasons to take a long hard look at Pinterest.</h4>
<h3>1. Pinterest is Big</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-and-pinterest-in-social-commerce-2013-10">Business Insider reported</a> that in the second quarter of 2013, “Pinterest accounted for 23% of global social-mediated e-commerce sales.” That was almost equal to Facebook, despite a userbase five times smaller. The network itself is massively larger today than 2013. From March 2014 to March 2015, <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/04/29/pinterest-evan-sharp-users/#_9wxV5J5JiqP">Pinterest&#8217;s user base climbed 25% year-over-year</a> to 72.8 million monthly active users.” Its userbase is now estimated to have passed 100 million active users.</p>
<h3>2. Pinterest Actually Drives Sales</h3>
<p class="p1">Pinterest isn’t just big; it actually drives ecommerce sales. According to a fascinating and insightful <a href="http://go.curalate.com/white-paper/visual-marketing-analytics-the-rise-of-visual-social-media">Curalate whitepaper</a>, Pinterest is the second largest referral traffic driver to retail sites. It drives more traffic to than Reddit, YouTube, and Twitter combined!</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, Pinterest users have an average order value 75% greater than Facebook users, and the average shopping cart size of a Pinterest user is $170 — making <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/grow-your-pinterest-audience/">Pinterest marketing a high-ROI activity</a>.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-user-by-categories.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15567" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-user-by-categories.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-pinterest-user-by-categories" width="637" height="479" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-user-by-categories.png 637w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-user-by-categories-300x226.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Pinterest helps users make purchases in all categories.</em></p>
<p class="p1">People use Pinterest specifically to shop; for many, it functions as a cross-site wishlist. A <a href="https://www.millwardbrowndigital.com/pinterest-and-the-power-of-future-intent/">Millward Brown study</a> found that 93% of Pinterest users use Pinterest to plan for purchases, and 87% said Pinterest helped them decide what to purchase.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-users-buying-power.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15568" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-users-buying-power.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-pinterest-users-buying-power" width="695" height="435" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-users-buying-power.png 695w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-users-buying-power-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Pinterest users have more than twice the buying power of an average Internet user.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Pinterest also delivers an affluent audience. <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/What-Potential-Does-Pinterest-Have-as-an-Advertising-Platform">comScore</a> finds that Pinterest users spend twice as much online as the average Internet user, and a <a href="http://connexity.com/blog/2012/10/online-consumer-pulse-pinterest-vs-facebook-which-social-sharing-site-wins-at-shopping-engagement/">BizRate Insights</a> survey found that 30% of users had an annual household income over $100,000.</p>
<h3>3. Pinterest is Easy and Uses Your Already Existing Site</h3>
<p class="p1">Perhaps most importantly, there’s a super low threshold to entry with Pinterest. The beauty of Pinterest is that it doesn’t take hiring another community manager to capitalize on the opportunity.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike Facebook or Twitter, 85% of brand engagement comes from a brand’s website and not their page on Pinterest. All you need to do is optimize your product images and prepare for Pins from your website.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-sephora-page.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15570" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-sephora-page.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-sephora-page" width="693" height="436" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-sephora-page.png 693w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-sephora-page-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Every product image on your website is a potential Pin –– which on average is Repinned 8 times.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Customers will Pin images from your website, whether you facilitate it or not. If you’re not prepared, a Pin will take your image out of context and you will lose out on potential customers. You should ensure your product images are the highest quality and follow these Pinterest best practices.</p>
<h2>5 Hugely Important Pinterest Best Practices</h2>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-best-practices.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15564" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-best-practices.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-pinterest-best-practices" width="685" height="452" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-best-practices.png 685w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-best-practices-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Customers can buy directly from Pinterest if you set up Buyable Pins. img source: pinterest.com</em></p>
<p class="p1">There’s a lot of ways to use Pinterest as a business. Here’s how to get started.</p>
<h3>1. Optimize your product images</h3>
<p class="p1">Pinterest users Pin images to boards, like an Internet version of old school magazine clippings. As an retailer, you’ve already got thousands of product images on your website that you’re eager to get in front of as wide of an audience as possible. Every single image on your site could be Pinned by a potential customer; in fact, it may already have been Pinned.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-consistent-images.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15560" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-consistent-images.jpg" alt="pixelz-social-media-consistent-images" width="750" height="328" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-consistent-images.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-consistent-images-300x131.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Consistency is quality for product images.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Make sure your images are as professional as possible. Consistency is quality when it comes to product images. You want all your images to be perfectly lit, in full focus and processed identically. They should be aligned, cropped consistently, color corrected, shadowed optimally and be as appealing as possible to your customer.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-smartphone.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15571" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-smartphone.jpg" alt="pixelz-social-media-smartphone" width="750" height="537" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-smartphone.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-smartphone-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>You can use your smartphone to take high quality images on a budget. Img source: pixelz.com</em></p>
<p class="p1">You don’t have to spend a bundle to have quality images. You can setup a minimal photography studio, build out a production team, and run an efficient product photography studio on a budget. You can even even take professional photos with a smartphone.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-camera.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15559" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-camera.jpg" alt="pixelz-social-media-camera" width="750" height="573" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-camera.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-camera-300x229.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Use the proper aperture, ISO, and white balance for your studio conditions. Img source: pixelz.com</em></p>
<p class="p1">If you have the budget for a DSLR camera, lighting setup and studio space, awesome! Ensure you have the correct camera settings. Your aperture, ISO and white balance are major factors in your ultimate image quality.</p>
<p class="p1">Prepare your product with simple styling and cleaning techniques, use a white or neutral background and consider how to effectively use shadows.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, se responsive design to optimize your site and product images for the mobile web. The modern web is largely mobile, and Pinterest is no exception. In fact, they’re an extreme case: Venturebeat reports that <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/31/80-percent-of-pinterests-traffic-comes-from-mobile-devices/">80% of Pinterest traffic is mobile</a>. Make sure you optimize your product images for mobile with responsive design.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-21-at-7.35.35-AM.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15572" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-21-at-7.35.35-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-12-21 at 7.35.35 AM" width="750" height="315" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-21-at-7.35.35-AM.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-21-at-7.35.35-AM-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/pixelz-image-editing-service/"><br />

<h3>2. Add the Pin It button to your website</h3>
<p class="p1">After optimizing your product images, adding the Pin It button is the single most important thing you can do. It’s easy, it’s quick, it brings more impressions and traffic, and you get data on what people are Pinning. If you do nothing else, do this.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pin-button.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15563" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pin-button.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-pin-button" width="750" height="208" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pin-button.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pin-button-300x83.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">The Pin It button only takes a single line of code.</p>
<p class="p1">Pinterest makes it simple. Create a <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en/set-your-business-account">business account</a>. Go to Bigcommerce and<a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Verifying-Your-Store-with-Pinterest#verify"> verify your store</a>. Then, <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en/pin-it-button">get a Pin It button</a>. It’s a single line of code, and now you’ve amplified your reach tremendously. You’ll have access to analytics, and your logo will be added to any Pin from your website.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-logo-on-pins.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15561" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-logo-on-pins.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-logo-on-pins" width="689" height="356" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-logo-on-pins.png 689w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-logo-on-pins-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Your logo is added to Pins from your website after you set up the Pin It button.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Now it’s both easier for people to Pin your images AND identify the source with your logo. That means someone who sees your product images from a Pin or Repin is more likely to find your store and make a purchase.</p>
<h3>3. Set up Product Pins (Rich Pins)</h3>
<p class="p1">Website owners can add more information using Rich Pins. For ecommerce store owners, Rich Pins are particularly useful for Product Pins, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pinterest/products-we-love/">like these</a>. They make it easier for people to buy from you.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-legos-idea.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15566" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-legos-idea.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-pinterest-legos-idea" width="558" height="478" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-legos-idea.png 558w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-pinterest-legos-idea-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Product Pins add real time pricing, availability, and purchase location into a Pin.</em></p>
<p class="p1">A Product Pin includes real time pricing, availability and where to buy. They take a lot more work than the Pin It button does, but the value is obvious. If you look at your analytics and are seeing real traction from Pinterest, then it’s worth investing some developer time into the <a href="https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/rich-pins/products/">meta tag markup that enables Product Pins</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>Note: Bigcommerce customers can use our <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Using-Rich-Pins">Pinterest Rich Pins plugin</a> to assist with this process.</em></strong></p>
<h3>4. Create Targeted Pinterest Boards</h3>
<p class="p1">While most Pins will come directly from your website, if you have the resources, you should build out your own Pinterest page. It will increase Pins of your product, allow you to react to analytics, provide you the opportunity to create targeted boards and you can create a brand identity by engaging socially.</p>
<p class="p1">Be social. Don’t just Pin your own product images. You’ll quickly be tuned out if you only care about yourself and are endlessly self-promoting. Engage with the community and Repin relevant inspirational content; like and comment on Pins that are related to your business.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-madewell.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15555" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-madewell.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-madewell" width="673" height="253" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-madewell.png 673w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-madewell-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Madewell’s top December boards are themed around gifting, holiday parties, and cold weather.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Create multiple boards and organize them logically. You can base a board around a theme, like holidays and seasons, around product categories, or anything else that provides targeted content. You can have as many boards as you want, so it makes sense to refine your boards and make them snackable. Just make sure there are enough Pins to give the board some weight, and choose an attractive cover that accurately represents the board.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-sephora.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15556" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-sephora.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-sephora" width="750" height="289" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-sephora.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-sephora-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Sephora has boards themed around daily Pins to provide followers regular content.</em></p>
<p class="p1">You can provide current content with boards that are focused on in-the-moment happenings, like “Trending Now.” A board like Sephora’s “Makeup of the Day” is especially effective because it enables them to Pin user content and engage with their customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Note that Sephora has two daily boards side-by-side: one is user content (“Makeup of the Day”), and the other is product images (“Today’s Obsession”). If someone is following both boards, a connection is drawn from the product to its use in real life, context that increases the likelihood of converting a sale.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-tory.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15557" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-tory.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-tory" width="750" height="276" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-tory.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-tory-300x110.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Tory Burch categorizes boards by color for creative collections.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Color based collections are popular and effective, which makes sense if you consider the keyword based nature of search. If someone searches for “yellow purse,” it’s good to put as many as possible in front of them.</p>
<p class="p1">What colors get the most shares? A <a href="http://blog.curalate.com/2014/02/06/8-image-features-that-shine-on-pinterest/">Curalate study</a> of image characteristics found that reddish-orange colored photos are shared the most, and that images with multiple dominant colors get more shares. They also found that shares drop from 200-400% if your image has 40% or more background, and that images without faces get 23% more shares.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember to use taller images for Pins, because they look better on mobile. Your images should be at least 600px wide and have as little text as possible on the image itself.</p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-lowe.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15554" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-lowe.png" alt="pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-lowe" width="750" height="282" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-lowe.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pixelz-social-media-boards-on-pinterest-lowe-300x113.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Lowe’s uses boards to provide DIY inspiration.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Pinterest is based around aspiration and inspiration, so boards with creative images that provide context for your product are always a good idea. Lowe’s home improvement has boards that are entirely product images, but they also have inspirational project boards. Show your customers why they want your product by demonstrating the results of a purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Pin what’s popular, based on your own Pinterest analytics. If you see an image is performing well, try Pinning similarly themed images. Make sure you use a clear and fun description, because that will make it easier for users to find when searching. Include keywords, even if visually obvious, in order to optimize for search. Use hashtags.</p>
<h3>5. Sell directly from Pinterest with Buyable Pins</h3>
<p><center><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-21-at-7.42.40-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15573" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-21-at-7.42.40-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-12-21 at 7.42.40 AM" width="547" height="416" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-21-at-7.42.40-AM.png 547w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-21-at-7.42.40-AM-300x228.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" /></a></center></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Buyable Pins let users buy directly from the Pinterest app.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Buyable Pins let you sell directly from the Pinterest app for iOS and Android. It doesn’t have any effect outside of the app, but remember that 80% of Pinterest use is mobile.</p>
<p class="p1">Keep in mind that this is a new feature, so right now it only works for some select brands and users of a handful of ecommerce platforms. Bigcommerce merchants can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/pinterest">sign up for Buyable Pin testing</a> to make it easy for shoppers to buy on Pinterest.</p>
<h2>Be “Pinteresting”</h2>
<p class="p1">It’s pretty hard to get away from puns on the internet, but Pinterest is so proud of their “Pinteresting” piece of wordplay. It’s a dad joke, but it’s also good advice. Increasing Pins of your content, especially product images, will increase your sales.</p>
<p class="p1">If you can expand your reach, increase engagement and improve conversion rates –– and all with just a couple lines of code –– you have to do it. Optimize your product images, add the Pin It button, and embrace the pun. Be Pinteresting.</p>

In fact, this year’s Black Friday saw a <a href="http://cardnotpresent.com/news/cnp-news-nov15/Online_Shoppers_Set_Records,_Outnumber_Those_in_Stores_on_Thanksgiving,_Black_Friday_-_Nov__30,_2015/">record number of online shoppers</a>. For the first time in history, online sales exceeded transactions in brick-and-mortar shops.</p>
<p class="p1">The not-so-good news? There are <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-is-click-fraud-identify-and-prevent-fraudulent-clicks/">more fraudsters than ever</a> targeting online businesses. Credit card fraud attempts grew <a href="http://cardnotpresent.com/news/default.aspx?id=12529">from 2014 to 2015</a>, and thanks to the October EMV roll-out that makes physical credit cards much harder to counterfeit, experts predict that more criminals will move online. When examining the numbers from other countries that implemented EMV cards, retailers saw exponential growth in <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/protect-your-online-store-fraud/">online ecommerce fraud</a> in the following years, increasing <a href="http://www.fico.com/en/wp-content/secure_upload/Mercator-for-FICO-EMV-whitepaper.pdf">anywhere from 30-60%</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>Retailers saw growth in online fraud following EMV activation, increasing anywhere from 30-60%.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Retailers+saw+growth+in+online+fraud+following+EMV+activation%2C%C2%A0increasing+anywhere+from+30-60%25.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/5-types-of-fraud-to-watch-for-in-the-new-year/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">So, what can merchants operating online do to prepare for the inevitable flood of shoppers, both good and bad? Knowing how to spot the suspicious shoppers is key, and we’ve pulled together the most common types of fraud that you might encounter.</p>
<h2>Big Spenders</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ITA18FXIBL.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15547" src="http://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ITA18FXIBL.jpg" alt="ITA18FXIBL" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ITA18FXIBL.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ITA18FXIBL-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If you notice a user purchasing many high-value goods or many variations of the same product (for example, 15 gold watches or 20 silver rings in varying sizes), you might have a fraudster looking to maximize a stolen credit card number before it’s cancelled. The fraudster behind this type of order often purchases as many items as possible that can be easily resold, within a short time frame.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, sometimes your shoppers are just exceptionally generous gifters or opulent buyers. Follow up on these transactions with excellent and thorough customer service. Arming yourself with lots of data can quicken the decision to process such orders right away or cancel them. If you have a fraud prevention solution in place, it can help you pull social media links, email account age and purchase history to verify a shopper’s identity.</p>
<h2>Reshippers</h2>
<p class="p1">Reshippers are fraudsters that use an intermediary to make their orders look less suspicious. As buying and selling online grew more popular, retailers quickly learned that international orders could be riskier than domestic ones. To <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/minimize-disputes-and-chargebacks/">avoid the pain of chargebacks</a> or black market reselling, many retailers may make business rules to automatically ban any overseas orders.</p>
<p class="p1">In order to get around this barrier, fraudsters based abroad make purchases (usually with stolen credit card information) and use individuals or freight companies in the same country as the store to act as the shipping address for orders. Then the packages are forwarded along to their final destinations, where their contents may be sold on the black market. When scammers use a reshipper, they’re able to bypass basic static fraud detection rules.</p>
<p class="p1">Read up on <a href="http://blog.siftscience.com/blog/behind-the-signal-doral-fl">Doral, FL</a> and research some of the other common reshipper postal codes in order to quickly separate out the potential reshipper fraudsters from the legitimate shoppers.</p>
<h2>Credit Card Testing</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ZOM5QYEIMV-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-15548" src="http://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ZOM5QYEIMV-1.jpg" alt="ZOM5QYEIMV (1)" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ZOM5QYEIMV-1.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ZOM5QYEIMV-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If a cyber-crook has a stash of stolen credit card numbers, you may notice a series of unusually small purchases from a user or two. The goal of credit card testing isn’t really to buy a bunch of things; rather, the fraudster is trying to determine which credit card numbers are still valid and which have been canceled. Especially if you offer free shipping or a “guest” check-out process, credit card testers may be drawn to your shop to try out as many cards as possible before going in to buy the big-ticket items.</p>
<p class="p1">Smart fraud solutions can highlight suspicious IP address activity or device fingerprints. Keep an eye on accounts that either prefer guest checkout, that have <a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/credit-card-fraud/">suspicious characteristics</a> or exhibit unusual buying behavior.</p>
<h2>Refund Fraud</h2>
<p class="p1">Imagine being thrown in jail for a crime that you didn’t commit … without a trial. That’s what refund abuse can feel like for online merchants. This type of fraud occurs when a customer bypasses the retailer by going straight to their bank to dispute a purchase. The customer may say that the order never arrived (even when it did) or that their credit card was stolen (when it wasn’t). The bank will issue a refund to the customer and deduct the transaction from the merchant, often with an added fee.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>The shoppers that commit refund fraud look and act like legitimate customers.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=The+shoppers+that+commit+refund+fraud+look+and+act+like+legitimate+customers.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/5-types-of-fraud-to-watch-for-in-the-new-year/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">This type of fraud is a challenge, since the fraudsters skip the merchant altogether. Often falling under the umbrella of “friendly fraud,” the shoppers that commit refund fraud look and act like legitimate customers. Retailers that suspect refund fraud may add identity verification steps, like signature-required delivery and phone-call follow-ups.</p>
<h2>Promo and Coupon Abuse</h2>
<p class="p1">If you offer coupons or promotional credit for shoppers to invite friends, you may be opening yourself up to promo code abuse. Whether it’s a sale deal or a loyalty code for inviting friends, abuse of these promotions lose you money –– if you offer $5 in store credit for every friend that a shopper refers, a fraudster can create hundreds of fake email addresses, and gather all of that free credit on your site.</p>
<p class="p1">Identifying fake and linked accounts is the key to avoid losing money on promo code abuse. Employing an anti-fraud solution that uses machine learning to actively learn and dynamically adapt to changing fraudster tactics can keep retailers ahead of the scammers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="p1">It may be familiar advice, but communication is key to keeping legitimate customers happy and reducing the number of scammers on your site. Open, frequent dialogue between your marketing, customer service and risk departments will protect your bottom line while growing your top line. Start off your new year right by staying ahead of these fraudsters; your bank account and legitimate customer-base will thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="750" height="383" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WP1KHDXGOY.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WP1KHDXGOY.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WP1KHDXGOY-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p class="p1">Ecommerce solutions have come a long way in just a few years. A lot of brick-and-mortar businesses have already tried to go online with limited results. If your last website was built in 1998, 2005 or even in 2011, the odds are high that you are using a solution that does less, costs more and takes more maintenance than some of the newer solutions.</p>
<p class="p1">New tools offer polished branding and more engaging customer experiences. Inventory management has become easier and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/ecommerce-analytics/">detailed reporting</a> helps business owners make well-informed decisions. Businesses are tracking their customers while saving time and getting better insights into their business. Most importantly, success no longer requires technical expertise with platforms dedicated to ease-of-use and service.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>Businesses are now saving time and getting better insights into their business.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Businesses+are+now+saving+time+and+getting+better+insights+into+their+business.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/10-new-tools-and-strategies-for-brick-and-mortar-businesses-looking-to-grow-online/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">There is no perfect-for-everyone solution, so make sure you are thinking about what makes your business unique. There are many new industry-standard features that can help almost any business.</p>
<h3>Built for Sales</h3>
<p class="p1">Your business exists to make money. Your ecommerce site exists to generate sales. Almost any website can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/accept-credit-cards-and-payments/" target="_blank">accept credit cards</a>, but that does not make it an ecommerce store. One of the biggest differences between a website and an ecommerce platform is that an ecommerce platform is built for sales every step of the way.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>Your business exists to make money. Your ecommerce site exists to generate sales.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Your+business+exists+to+make+money.+Your+ecommerce+site+exists+to+generate+sales.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/10-new-tools-and-strategies-for-brick-and-mortar-businesses-looking-to-grow-online/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">The engineers and designers working behind the scenes at ecommerce platform companies spend years thinking about the way that your customers navigate through pages, the various design themes you can choose from, the focus on images and descriptions and the one-page checkout experience. Every step is made to say, “I am valuable, interesting and trustworthy.” The best even have extra tools like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/cart-abandonment-software">Bigcommerce’s Abandoned Cart</a>, which automatically emails anyone who starts to checkout and then leaves without finishing their purchase. This tool alone saves an average of 15% of would-be-lost sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Just getting on a platform built with that philosophy can boost your conversion rate instantly.</p>
<h3>Easy-to-Use, High Quality Branding</h3>
<p class="p1">Before online customers consider paying for anything, they are going to see your site’s design. Its look and feel will affect their opinions whether they want it to or not.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>Your site&#8217;s look and feel will affect consumer opinions on whether they want to purchase or not.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Your+site%27s+look+and+feel+will+affect+consumer+opinions+on+whether+they+want+to+purchase+or+not.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/10-new-tools-and-strategies-for-brick-and-mortar-businesses-looking-to-grow-online/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">Professional design shops can cost thousands of dollars. They are great for taking your image to the next level, but new ecommerce solutions give business owners access to slick, professional site design with free or low-cost templates that you can install with no technical expertise. With hundreds of templates to choose from, businesses can find a look that matches the personality of the shop.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, having a mobile friendly site is more important than ever. Customers want to look at your site while on-the-go or while standing in your brick-and-mortar shop. Mobile use is so common that <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-news-4-24-15/">Google factors it in</a> when deciding how high to rank your site. If your site isn’t mobile-friendly, you will slide lower on Google rankings, making it harder for customers to find you.</p>
<h3>Integrated Inventory Tracking</h3>
<p class="p1">For a business selling in multiple places, integration is key. If you use the wrong tools, it could be like running two businesses at the same time. You’ll be managing two different inventories, managing different sales lists and accidentally selling items you don’t have in stock anymore. That mistake creates negative customer experiences and wastes everyone’s time.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>For a business selling in multiple places, integration is key.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=For+a+business+selling+in+multiple+places%2C+integration+is+key.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/10-new-tools-and-strategies-for-brick-and-mortar-businesses-looking-to-grow-online/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">New integrated tools allow you to automatically sync up your product details and stock levels. Customers will be able to see what’s in stock, when it’s in stock –– without you paying attention every second of the day.</p>
<h3>Remote Access &amp; Reporting</h3>
<p class="p1">SaaS systems offer incredible freedom to business owners. Remote access means that as a business owner or manager, you can login to your management system from anywhere and see how your business is performing, identify inventory issues, help resolve mistake or just track sales performance. You are free to get things done wherever you are and not be tethered to any one location. Check out this <a href="http://tools.bigcommerce.com/total-cost-of-ownership-calculator/">ROI calculator</a> for on-premise versus SaaS solutions to get an idea of your cost savings, too.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>SaaS systems offer incredible freedom to business owners.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=SaaS+systems+offer+incredible+freedom+to+business+owners.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/10-new-tools-and-strategies-for-brick-and-mortar-businesses-looking-to-grow-online/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">Better yet, get an advanced reporting system that will let you closely track how your products are performing. You can make quick adjustments to inventory or prices to get the most out of your product line. Maybe your best selling online products are different from your best in-store products.</p>
<h3>Customer Tracking &amp; Loyalty</h3>
<p class="p1">The best ecommerce and in-store tools will help you gather detailed information about your customers. The most basic tool is collecting contact information. Those details will help you create long lasting relationships and grow your customer base. But, even more than that, you will be able to see how your best and worst customers behave, identify patterns and test new promotions or behaviors to start creating more loyal customers and drive more referrals.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>The best ecommerce tools will help you gather detailed information about your customers. </em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=The+best+ecommerce+tools+will+help+you+gather+detailed+information+about+your+customers.+&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/10-new-tools-and-strategies-for-brick-and-mortar-businesses-looking-to-grow-online/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">Don’t forget about content, either. Let your customers write content for you by posting reviews of your products right on the site itself. This strategy is one of the easiest ways to build trust.</p>
<h3>Unified Accounting</h3>
<p class="p1">Having multiple systems never gets more complicated than during tax season. If you can find a system that will automatically update your sales and accounting information into one place, you will save hours of frustration. You may also save hundreds or even thousands of dollars in accounting fees.</p>
<h2>The Right Growth Patterns for Your Business</h2>
<p class="p1">Make a one-, five-, and ten-year plan. There are a lot of different strategies that successful businesses use to expand online. It may be overwhelming to take all of them in at once. And, something that worked for someone else may not be the best fit for your particular business.</p>
<p class="p1">What makes your business unique? What are some key strengths?</p>
<p class="p1">Below are some examples of common growth opportunities that will be relevant to some businesses, but not to others. If any of them sound familiar, be sure to think about how your software solutions will help or hinder your growth down the road.</p>
<h3>Trade Shows &amp; Pop-up Shops</h3>
<p class="p1">There are often opportunities in your area to reach new local customers without committing too much extra investment. Do your products travel well? Are there tourist events in the area? You may consider hiring an employee to represent your business at <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wholesale-or-bust/">a temporary location</a>. If you do, try to find an integrated POS system that can go mobile and stay connected to your website.</p>
<h3>Changing Your &#8220;Home Base&#8221;</h3>
<p class="p1">Will the way you do business change in the next five years? When selecting your next software solution, you will probably be thinking about one system as more important and the others as less important. Maybe you are 95% in-store and you don’t really care about your online solution right now, so anything will do as long as it works with your in-store solution.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>Find a platform with lots of growth options through partners and integrations.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Find+a+platform+with+lots+of+growth+options+through+partners+and+integrations.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/10-new-tools-and-strategies-for-brick-and-mortar-businesses-looking-to-grow-online/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">We have seen this equation change when folks don’t expect it. An online side project becomes a fully grown ecommerce success story, taking over 50% or more of the business’s revenue. You don’t need to make huge sacrifices, but make sure you consider the whole platform and potential future success. If you can, find a platform with lots of growth options through partners and integrations.</p>
<h3>Opening a Second Location or Warehouse</h3>
<p class="p1">If you are storing all your products in one place now, will that always be the case? Maybe in a few years a second retail location will become available. Maybe your website will be so successful that you start storing separate ecommerce inventory in a warehouse. Some platforms can manage multiple locations much easier than others.</p>
<h3>Selling to Different Audiences Online</h3>
<p class="p1">As you learn more about your online customers, you may realize that there are a couple of different audiences you want to speak to at once. This will be especially true for businesses that combine retail and wholesale. Will you need a second website? Can your website segment your customers with different content and prices?</p>

Retailers failing to recognize that simply will not be successful, or as successful, in today’s current commerce climate. The following <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2015/01/20/10-new-findings-about-the-millennial-consumer/">data points</a> are repeated often, but they drive the point home:</p>

</ul>
<p class="p1">This data makes the argument that if you win a millennial’s purchase, you win their loyalty. Why does this matter? Because there are 80 million millennials in the U.S. alone and they represent about a fourth of the entire population, with $200 billion in annual buying power.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>There are 80 million millennials in the U.S. alone, with $200B in annual buying power.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=There+are+80+million+millennials+in+the+U.S.+alone%2C+with+%24200B+in+annual+buying+power.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/bigcommerce-yotpo-the-bottom-line-benefits-of-customer-review-automation-as-explained-by-three-successful-retailers/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">You want the customer lifetime value of a millennial, but you have to earn it –– authentically. Ads aren’t your solution here. Pricing, while important to millennials (a generation which knows well how to search for online deals and the lowest price), doesn’t outweigh convenience or empathy. Loyalty is the currency in which millennials deal –– but you have to prove to them you’re worthy.</p>
<p class="p1">Brands demonstrate their value via social proof and customer reviews. Reviews have become so important, in fact, that some studies are showing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/16/who-millennials-trust-and-dont-trust-is-driving-the-new-economy/">millennials trust online strangers</a> (i.e. reviews) more than their friends or family (i.e. traditional word of mouth marketing). That’s a huge shift in the way retailers think about marketing, loyalty and customer engagement. And, for many smaller retailers out there nipping at the heels of the bigger box brands, this is one aspect of the marketing game that is difficult to execute well.</p>
<p class="p1">Why? Because it takes time, and managing multiple selling channels, ensuring your inventory is properly accounted for and getting items out to customers in a way that competes with Amazon’s timeliness is hard enough.That makes it easy for customer engagement outside of social media and product delivery to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="p1">This is where Yotpo comes in –– an ecommerce integration which automates the gathering of reviews process and then combines all reviews into a mini-site, giving your brand ample customer testimony and promotional content as well as increasing your SEO.</p>

<p class="p1">In fact, Yotpo is one of the most popular ecommerce tools in the business, used by more than 15,000 online stores. It’s likely that if you’ve left a review for a product, assuming you bought from a brand rather than a marketplace, you’ve used Yotpo to do so.</p>
<p class="p1">Given the popularity of the app, we caught up with a couple Bigcommerce merchants using Yotpo to get the insights into how well it works, how it has helped their business and more.</p>
<h3>Could you describe your experience using Yotpo with your Bigcommerce store?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>Scott Gutschke, President at <a href="https://www.gtechfitness.com/">GTech Fitness</a></em>: The ability to post product reviews from my store directly to Facebook and Twitter definitely helps create a social buzz about the product itself, as well as helping to promote the Gtech Fitness brand.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>Daniel Nunney, Owner at <a href="https://www.golfcartgarage.com/">Golf Cart Garage</a></em>: We’ve used the Yotpo app for Bigcommerce for about a year and a half. We originally started out with the free plan and in the past six months bumped it up to their premium plan. We’ve had great success with reviews and the Yotpo app. Many of our competitors do not utilize reviews, so it has been a very nice differentiator in our industry.</p>
<h3>How do you use the Yotpo app to increase sales and better connect with your customers?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>Daniel Nunney, Owner at <a href="https://www.golfcartgarage.com/">Golf Cart Garage</a></em>: We send a “Please provide your review” email 10 days post-sale, and then again 24 days post-sale, if they haven’t yet given a review. We’ve had very good participation from our customers. In addition, we include a “site reviews” section where customers can view reviews specifically about our store. This has been a nice feature that we’ve added to our homepage.</p>

<p class="p1">We also use the comment and Q&amp;A features to really connect with customers. This allows us to connect directly with customers who provide reviews or have specific questions. Most importantly these comments/Q&amp;A’s show up on product pages which give prospective customers more information and a view inside how we communicate/take care of customers. Awesome stuff.</p>
<h3>Have there been any unexpected outcomes from using the app?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>Scott Gutschke, President at <a href="https://www.gtechfitness.com/">GTech Fitness</a></em>: I went back and forth with Yotpo for a while, not sure if I wanted to use them. They were extremely patient with me, responsive and great to work with, so I’m forever sold now.</p>

<p class="p1">Prior to using Yotpo, getting customer reviews on a regular basis was almost non-existent. Yotpo makes it much easier for customers to actually review products. Plus, it is much easier on me as a store owner by taking the burden from me to try and collect reviews.</p>
<h3>What advice would you give a business considering installing the app?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>Scott Gutschke, President at <a href="https://www.gtechfitness.com/">GTech Fitness</a></em>: Install it. If you are looking for an all in one solution to collect product reviews, Yotpo makes it simple.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>Daniel Nunney, Owner at <a href="https://www.golfcartgarage.com/">Golf Cart Garage</a></em>: Do it. At least for our business, it has been one of the most important CRO methods that directly increased sales.</p>
<h3>Are there any other apps in the Bigcommerce marketplace you’d recommend?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em>Scott Gutschke, President at <a href="https://www.gtechfitness.com/">GTech Fitness</a></em>: <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/order-desk/">Order Desk</a>. It helps me to keep orders organized.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Daniel Nunney, Owner at <a href="https://www.golfcartgarage.com/">Golf Cart Garage</a></em>: <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/aftership-shipping-and-order-management/">AfterShip</a>. This app gives you the ability to let your customers know when products ship, when they are out for delivery and when they’ve been delivered. Many customers compliment us on these emails.</p>
