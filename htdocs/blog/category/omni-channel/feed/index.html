Optimizing it can help you to:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Save money</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">Ship products to customers</a> in a timely manner</li>
<li class="p1">Keep your ecommerce store running as smoothly as possible</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Inventory ties into every element of your store, from supply, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-warehousing/">to warehousing</a>, to order fulfilment and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p class="p1">But, great inventory management can also increase your sales.</p>
<p class="p1">How? Managing your inventory properly across all of your sales channels helps to lower your product cost and increase shipping speed – ultimately earning you increased customer loyalty and love.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the Amazon model –– and it isn’t out of reach for your business.</p>
<p class="p1">If you scale too quickly without <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/inventory-management-software/">the proper inventory management setup</a>, you may find yourself running out of stock (or having to raise your prices to avoid selling out, resulting in unhappy customers), losing track of your inventory (which warehouse was that in again?), or losing profit margins to inefficient processes.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the most important methods, concepts, and techniques that you can employ right now to ensure that doesn’t happen, and your inventory management solution is an asset not a liability, for your business.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Use Data to Make a Difference</h2>
<p class="p1">Managing inventory creates data, which you can use to streamline processes and improve your inventory and order management.</p>
<p class="p1">If you know how much you sell, when you sell it and hopefully why –– you can use that data to calculate how much stock you should have and when. That way, you can switch to more effective management options, predict sales, and manage your actual stock to create value.</p>
<p class="p1">At <a href="http://www.webretailer.com/lean-commerce/crucial-chad-rubin-amazon/">Think Crucial</a> – my personal ecommerce venture –– we used inventory data to scale a small Amazon store into a multi-channel ecommerce business, driving <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/selling-on-amazon/">$5 million in revenue per year</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">We looked at sales by channel, per period, turn, costs, profit per product, and average product lifespan. The data enabled us to improve inventory management and to forecast sales, which reduced unnecessary stock and cut costs.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21212" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="539" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana.jpg 1283w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana-300x253.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana-750x632.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Like Think Crucial, you can use inventory data to calculate how much stock you need throughout the year.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Connect with Skubana Now</h3></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">Want to use Skubana to help manage your multi-channel inventory? <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/skubana/">There&#8217;s a one-click app for that</a>.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"></div></p>
<h3 class="p3">Forecast Sales</h3>
<p class="p1">Sales forecasting is a skill that will allow you to use your existing data for future predictions.</p>
<p class="p1">While you can use statistical analysis or a tool for the purpose, simply projecting your current sales data (hopefully 1-5 years) onto a line chart and following the line up at the same rate of increase will allow you to make reasonable predictions.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if you have sold product A for 18 months with an average sales growth of 1.2% per month, you can estimate that you will continue to see that same growth.</p>
<p class="p1">This tells you how much of each product you are likely to sell for any given period, because you can use the previous year&#8217;s sales for that month or week to predict your sales for the coming year.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are a BigCommerce merchant, you can use BigCommerce&#8217;s out-of-the-box analytics to drill down into your individual product or SKU sales over various periods –– and use that to forecast.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s what that looks like on the backend:</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21201" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend.png" alt="" width="640" height="404" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend.png 1165w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-300x189.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-750x473.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-5.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21206" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-5.png" alt="" width="640" height="287" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-5.png 1392w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-5-300x134.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-5-750x336.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You’ll likely need to update your forecast model once per quarter –– adjusting based on actual growth versus expected growth to improve future predictions –– which is where the export tool comes in handy.</p>
<p class="p1">Effective forecasting can be thrown off by abnormalities in one sales channel, so the better your grasp on your demand generation, the better you can predict overall trends.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is a view BigCommerce merchants can use to drill down into channel activity:</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21205" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4.png" alt="" width="640" height="328" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4.png 1155w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4-300x154.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4-750x384.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21202" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="254" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-1.png 1138w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-1-300x119.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-1-750x298.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3">Identify Trends</h3>
<p class="p1">Sales trends include events like holidays, cold and hot weather, and popular opinion that drive sales up or down for one product or another, as well as trends in behavior.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, an ecommerce store specializing in selling teddy bears with hearts could expect to see a rise in sales around Valentine&#8217;s day, but also throughout spring, when couples tend to get engaged or married.</p>
<p class="p1">Identifying your sales trends should be a simple matter of identifying spikes in sales and pinpointing why — then adjusting inventory levels accordingly. If you can identify why sales have gone up, you can decide if that spike is a one-time thing or will happen again next year under the same circumstances.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, a spike in sales for rain boots before a hurricane means that you can probably skip using that trend in forecast data, but the same spike in May, which is typically a rainy month, probably means it&#8217;s a seasonal trend.</p>
<p class="p1">Beyond identifying trends that are driving up sales for inventory management, it’s smart to identify trends beforehand and prepare marketing campaigns to drive even more revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a basic calendar for the U.S for 2017. <a href="http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/usa/">You can see other countries here.</a></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21208" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-calendar.png" alt="" width="640" height="390" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-calendar.png 716w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-calendar-300x183.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3 class="p3">Know Your Par Levels</h3>
<p class="p1">Par levels, or Periodic Automatic Replenishment, is the minimum stock you can have on hand when you place a new order.</p>
<p class="p1">Par is basically safety stock, which prevents you from selling out in between orders.</p>
<p class="p1">You can calculate your Par level using:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Lead time</li>
<li class="p1">Sales forecast</li>
<li class="p1">Seasonal demand</li>
<li class="p1">Any back orders you may have</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you don&#8217;t have backorders and you&#8217;ve calculated seasonal demand into your sales forecast, par level is a simple calculation.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Lead Time x Expected Sales Per Period = Safety Stock</em></p>
<p class="p6"><strong>See this in action</strong></p>
<p class="p1">If you sell an average of 10 units per day and have a lead time of 21 days, you must have a minimum stock of 210 units when you place a new order.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>10 x 21 = 210</em></p>
<p class="p2"> However, you should add an additional safety margin.</p>
<p class="p1">You might still need some time to add the new stock to your inventory, the order might be delayed, you might have returns, and you might have an unexpected surge in sales.</p>
<p class="p1">For this reason, you should calculate at least 10% over your minimum safety stock. In this case, 221 units would be enough to ensure that you won&#8217;t sell out under normal conditions.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>210 x .1 = 21</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>210 + 21 = 221</em></p>
<p class="p1">Tools like Skubana allow you to automate this process by setting <a href="https://support.skubana.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003960047-Auto-Reorder-Rules-">automatic reorder points</a> based on par levels, so your inventory never dips below par. These levels are set automatically by the system and changed constantly based on how your items are selling.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21207" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6.png" alt="" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6.png 698w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6-300x147.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Par levels need to be reported out on a business level, across channels — including Amazon, physical store, and your webstore. Failing to account for one of these can throw off your ability to fulfill and manage orders from any sales channel.</p>
<p class="p1">On BigCommerce, you can see revenue from your various channels, including storefront, Amazon, Instagram, Facebook, eBay, etc. To see orders from those channels and measure Par levels, you’ll need to export your order list.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21203" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="285" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2.png 1136w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2-300x133.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2-750x333.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3">Keep an Eye on Sales Turns</h3>
<p class="p1">Sales turnover for your industry can help you to better understand how much product you should keep on hand based on the industry.</p>
<p class="p1">If you have access to trade benchmarks for your industry, you can use those.</p>
<p class="p1">Otherwise, <a href="https://www.retailowner.com/Benchmarks">Benchmarks.com</a> offers free industry standards which you can use as a guideline. Simply find the inventory turnover for your industry, and divide the period in a year you want to use by that number.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, let’s look at days, weeks, or months.</p>
<p class="p1">If we were to apply that with the category &#8220;online shopping&#8221; which has an average inventory turnover rate of 5.5, we could calculate that a turn is 2.18 months, 9.45 weeks, or 66 days, which is the maximum inventory supply you should have on hand.</p>
<p class="p1">That is:</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>12 months / 5.5 = 2.18</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>52 weeks / 5.5 = 9.45</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>365 days / 5.5 = 66.36 </em></p>
<p class="p1">Once you have calculated your turns, you can use this rate to directly calculate your maximum inventory per period. This rate is simply your calculated sales for the period x the turnover period.</p>
<p class="p1">In most cases, you should not have more than 1 turns worth of inventory on hand at any one time.</p>
<p class="p1">Chances are that you already have the data to perform these calculations.</p>
<h2 class="p6">The Just in Time Inventory Model</h2>
<p class="p1">You can also use these same calculations to integrate new multichannel inventory management models.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, JIT or Just in Time inventory is a model that focuses on reducing costs by stocking the minimum amount to prevent a stock out event.</p>
<p class="p1">This allows you to reduce warehousing volume, take some of the burden off inventory management, and reduce total inventory storage costs.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2011/WCE2011_pp904-908.pdf">Toyota</a> is possibly one of the largest and most notorious companies to implement JIT inventory. Using it, Toyota was able to reduce costs, reduce storage costs, improve lead times, reduce waste, and reduce employee man-hours spent in counting and quality checking stock.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21213" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota.png" alt="" width="640" height="331" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota.png 1452w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota-750x388.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3">Is Low Inventory Always the Solution?</h3>
<p class="p1">While it can be tempting to think that keeping your inventory as low as possible is the easiest way to save money, you must also consider your supplier or manufacturer.</p>
<p class="p1">Ordering to the manufacturer’s EOQ or Economic Order Quantity allows you to save considerably on product purchase costs. If you order less, you will pay more per product, which may not offset the cost saved in warehousing and inventory management. If your demand is over EOQ, this is likely not a consideration.</p>
<p class="p1">Great inventory is about keeping enough stock on hand to meet customer demand so that you can fulfill quickly, while keeping it low enough to reduce costs and the burden on your warehousing.</p>
<p class="p1">And with customers making purchases from more touchpoints than ever before, you need to have the infrastructure to support multi-channel fulfillment.</p>
<p class="p2">Grant Yuan, President at <a href="https://www.cuttingboard.com/">CuttingBoard LLC</a>, attributes much of his business’s growth to proper inventory management across channels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Prior to inventory management software, we would manually sync our inventory levels each night using spreadsheets. It was tedious work that no one wanted to do.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, once CuttingBoard.com became bigger and we carried more SKUs, we started getting issues with stock outs and overselling product on places and having to cancel shipments.</p>
<p class="p1">It resulted in an extremely poor experience for our customers.</p>
<p class="p1">We realized we needed an automated system to update our inventory on the fly. Luckily, after testing a few systems, we found Skubana and have been with it ever since.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, we use Skubana to pull in our BigCommerce, eBay and Amazon orders into one centralized platform, which saves countless hours versus logging into each system separately.</p>
<p class="p1">I am a firm believer in embracing technology and tools that make our store deliver a superior experience for not just our customers, but my staff using our systems. This one in particular makes me very happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="p3">Understand Actual Profits</h2>
<p class="p1">While great inventory management can help you to reduce total costs, it can also help you to understand them so that you better understand your minimum sales points, which will allow you to make better use of repricing automation, marketing, sales and offers, and other tools to streamline sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Real cost of inventory is the total cost of the product, warehousing, delivery, marketing and merchandising.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Freight costs <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Cost of backorders<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Actual cost of inventory<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Interest on money borrowed for inventory <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Inventory damage/loss/theft <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Management costs <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Order management and inventory control</li>
<li class="p1">Dead stock <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Warehousing costs (rent, maintenance, electric, gas, inspections, employees)<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can calculate warehousing costs by determining how much of your warehouse the product uses, and dividing total costs by that.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if your top selling product is 1/100th of your inventory, 10% of your total warehousing costs belong to that product.</p>
<p class="p1">You can perform similar calculations to estimate freight costs per product. If you receive a shipment with 100 products, you can divide shipping costs based on product volume.</p>
<p class="p1">Your total sales per product minus the total costs of that product is your actual profit per product.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if you have an inventory value of $100,000 for Product A, which will drive $500,000 in total sales, you could use the following example to see an idea of where your money might be going.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21215" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="996" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet.jpg 650w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet-300x467.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In this example, you are spending 26.8% of total earnings on inventory without considering marketing, merchandising, website costs, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">You can easily perform a full calculation, including items like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Ecommerce software<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Merchandising <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Marketing <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Inventory management software<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Accounting <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Website hosting <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In most cases, your actual profits will go up and down depending on the time of year, market trends, seasonal demand, and other factors.</p>
<p class="p1">You can use your sales forecasts to calculate your total costs for each turn, which will allow you to make better decisions for marketing. Inventory costs are typically between 10 and 40% of total inventory value.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if you know your total costs, you can set better minimum pricing, which will allow you to use automatic repricing. This can help you to maintain the lowest cost product without undercutting yourself, so that you can own Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200401830">buy box buttons</a>, earn features on Walmart, and make Jet.com work for you.</p>
<p class="p1">Taking a step back to understand the whole supply chain can reveal insights you miss while head down in day-to-day operations.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Streamline Multichannel Inventory Management to Improve Customer Satisfaction</h2>
<p class="p1">Inventory management plays a large part in customer satisfaction because it impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Logistics</li>
<li class="p1">Order availability</li>
<li class="p1">Costs</li>
<li class="p1">Delivery times</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For example, some ecommerce businesses attempt to reduce inventory as much as possible by working with drop shipping or by spot ordering, but this reduces your ability to turn fulfill orders so that the customer gets them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">Jason Boyce, co-founder and CEO of Dazadi, understands this well –– and even cut his business off <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-failure-to-success/">from $2,000,000 in revenue</a> in order to increase customer satisfaction for the long run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“We noticed our performance metrics, on time delivery and order errors were significantly higher with our drop shippers than they were with our own inventory, with our own fulfillment centers. We had to make a drastic change,” says Boyce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">“So, we set out to open additional fulfillment centers and end our drop shipping relationships.  Today, we have four across the country, excluding the stuff we send off to Amazon FBA. Doing this forced us to reduce how many SKUs we offered, but now, we can focus on each individual SKU as an asset and build it up with SEO and customer satisfaction from purchase to delivery.”</p>
<p class="p1">Good inventory management will allow you to optimize your inventory control to balance between being able to quickly fulfill orders while keeping warehousing and managing costs as low as possible.</p>
<h2 class="p6">Real Time Inventory</h2>
<p class="p1">Integrating tools for <a href="https://www.skubana.com/multi-channel-inventory-management/">real-time inventory management</a> allows you to manage and track orders across sales channels, so that you always know your real inventory and don&#8217;t drop below par level.</p>
<p class="p1">This makes it easier to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Track re-order points to prevent a stockout</li>
<li class="p1">Track actual sales</li>
<li class="p1">Prioritize fulfilment for popular items</li>
<li class="p1">Manage returns and replacement items.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Each of these will, in turn, boost your order fulfilment speed so that customers get the item they want as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p6">EDI</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://support.skubana.com/hc/en-us/articles/219080177--HOW-TO-Adding-Bigcommerce-as-a-Sales-Channel">Setting up an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) integration</a> can save you money and allow you to speed up your inventory processes, because you can:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Communicate orders more quickly</li>
<li class="p1">Automate order forms</li>
<li class="p1">Automatically track shipments</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This allows you to reduce lead times so that you have to carry less total inventory and can improve communication with customers, while investing less in manual data entry.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a quick overview of how to set up BigCommerce as a sales channel on Skubana. Find <a href="https://support.skubana.com/hc/en-us/articles/219080177--HOW-TO-Adding-Bigcommerce-as-a-Sales-Channel">step-by-step instructions here</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">While quality inventory control and management typically requires investing in sales forecasts, technology, and data, it is well worth your time and money to do so. Inventory impacts your ecommerce store at every level, and improving it can save and earn you money for the long term.</p>

Even if you only had $1,000 to invest in 1997, today you’d have more than $626,000.</p>
<p class="p1">But who could have predicted back then that an online bookstore would, in two decades time, become one of the world’s most dominant online stores –– offering everything from the books they started with to the high-end fashion that resisted for so long?</p>
<p class="p1">20 years ago, there were a measly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/01/business/money-starts-to-show-in-internet-shopping.html">40 million people</a> using the internet in the U.S., and online sales generated only $2.4 billion. In 2017, more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2237/internet-usage-in-the-united-states/">287 million people in the U.S. alone</a> use the internet –– and online sales are expected to hit <a href="http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/report-online-retail-sales-hit-0-billion-01">$440 billion by year end</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">That is an 18,650% increase in global internet usage and an 18,233% increase in online sales.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Since 1997, there has been a 18,650% increase in global internet usage and an 18,233% increase in online sales.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Amazon’s stock price has risen in equal measure, from $18 in 1997 to around $948 at the time of writing –– a 5,166% increase.</p>
<p class="p1">This is no chicken and egg problem –– clearly the internet and online sales came first. But these days, it’s hard to tell whether Amazon grows larger as the internet and online sales do, or if the internet and online sales grow larger as Amazon does.</p>
<p class="p1">Either way, the relationship is symbiotic, and though for much of Amazon’s history small business and other verticalized online sellers made an enemy of the marketplace, <a href="https://www.junglescout.com/bright-future-for-amazon-sellers/">those tides are very quickly changing</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">After all, as the ecommerce industry hits one milestone after the other –– so, too, does Amazon.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Ecommerce + Amazon Facts and Stats</h2>
<p class="p1">You might feel the quickening pace at which ecommerce adoption and innovation is hitting market.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your business may be having to turn to online for inbound sales in an industry where business has historically been conducted over the phone.</li>
<li class="p1">Or perhaps you are now having to look to AI to implement new buyer journeys for Gen Z purchasers.</li>
<li class="p1">Or perhaps you simply feel the pressure to give your shoppers the options for free or two-day shipping –– just to compete in today’s competitive ecommerce market.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You are not wrong in that feeling. The innovative steps and measures taken today by online brands are part of an ongoing story about modern human convenience and the technology we wield to achieve it.</p>
<p class="p1">And Amazon has been a large part of the story for 20 years. Let’s take a look.</p>

<h2 class="p3">The Converging of Retail</h2>
<p class="p1">As you can see, 2016 was a pivotal year for online brands when it came to sentiment about selling on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, as the world’s 5th largest company, online brands have come to understand that trying to compete with Amazon is not an effective business strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, these brands have turned to finding ways to leverage the marketplace to their advantage –– growing sales and driving revenue through channels beyond their webstore.</p>
<p class="p1">Looking only at BigCommerce merchants, we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">20% of BigCommerce customers have connected their websites to at least one additional channel, like Amazon.</li>
<li class="p1">Of merchants who have enabled Amazon, roughly 12% of cumulative GMV comes through Amazon.</li>
<li class="p1">According to a recent survey of BigCommerce merchants, 73% of SMBs are considering expanding to sell on Amazon or eBay in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">The Amazon Timeline</h2>
<p class="p1">Here is what the past 20 years look like, visually, as Amazon and other online brands converge –– offering merchants additional product options, prices and convenience at every step along the way.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21068" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic.jpg" alt="amazon timeline" width="500" height="2950" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic.jpg 500w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic-300x1770.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">What does this mean for your brand?</h2>
<p class="p1">Selling on Amazon may not be the right choice for all brands –– depending on the products you sell and the stage of growth you are in.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s look at a few ways to determine whether your brand is ready to sell on Amazon.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Offer Unique Items, Not Third-Party</h3>
<p class="p1">According to James Thomson, Partner at the Buy Box Experts and former Head of Selling on Amazon, the products that do best on Amazon are unique items. This means goods you manufacture and sell yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is a short list of BigCommerce merchants <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-success-stories/">selling successfully</a> both on their webstore and on Amazon to give you an idea of what “unique products” means:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Dazadi</li>
<li class="p1">Austin Bazaar</li>
<li class="p1">Kap7</li>
<li class="p1">The Dairy Fairy</li>
<li class="p1">BeachRC</li>
<li class="p1">Folding Chairs and Tables</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">In general, if you both make and sell your own unique products, you are a good candidate for selling and succeeding on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Is Your Business a Good Fit for Amazon?</h3></p>
<p class="p1">In this piece, James Thomson gets in-depth about <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/what-to-know-before-selling-on-amazon/">who should (and more importantly, who should *not*) sell on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">Set Up Your Amazon Channel Right – The First Time</h3>
<p class="p1">There are plenty of nuances to successfully selling on Amazon, in the same way there are nuances to successfully selling on your webstore. Here are a few to watch out for:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Get your taxes in working orders:</strong> immediately upon signing up a new seller account, go into the Settings –&gt; Tax Settings, and designate not only in which states you want Amazon to collect state sales tax, but also set the “Use default Product Tax Code” setting to “A_GEN_TAX.”</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Measure profitability accurately:</strong> Don’t average everything out, and look only at your overall sales numbers and margins. Start thinking about every SKU you sell on Amazon as having its own P&amp;L, its own market forces, and its own level and types of competitions. Such an approach has helped many a seller rationalize its catalog, focusing on bottom line growth ahead of all other financial goals.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Look out for duplicate listings from competitors:</strong> Duplicate listings on Amazon can be an effective way for competitors to divert traffic away from your product listings back to theirs. It’s worth, at least once a quarter, to search the whole Amazon catalog for duplicate listings of your items.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Amazon Pitfalls and What You Need to Know Is Skip Right Over Them</h3></p>
<p class="p1">James Thomson is back at it again giving you all the dirty details to the most common selling on Amazon mistakes –– and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-selling-pitfalls-problems/">how to make sure you don’t make any of them</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">Know if You Need to Outsource</h3>
<p class="p1">If selling on Amazon is new for you, remember that you do not have to do all of the selling, setup or optimization by yourself. It may be worth it for your to hire a few outside and experienced sources to help you with tasks so you can focus on both your webstore and your Amazon channel growth.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ve put together a list of more than 230 companies that do just that, and sectioned them out by the service they offer and how to know you need them.</p>
<p class="p1">You can get the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-solution-provider-directory/">free directory</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Amazon-Directory-Solutions-Providers/dp/1544287208/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494445539&amp;sr=1-2">buy it on Amazon</a> to keep a physical copy on hand.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Looking to Optimize Your Amazon SEO?</h3></p>
<p class="p1">You’re in luck! Use our <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-asin-lookup-tool/">free ASIN Lookup tool</a> to figure out which keywords your competitors are using to rank highly on Amazon –– and then alter your strategy to boost your rankings (and your sales).</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">Sell What Works</h3>
<p class="p1">Folding Chairs and Tables now sees more than 10% of their revenue coming directly from Amazon –- and they’ve only been selling on Amazon a couple months.</p>
<p class="p1">How did they become so successful so fast?</p>
<p class="p1">By focusing on a single product they sell nowhere else on the web.</p>
<p class="p1">Using their BigCommerce Analytics, they were able to see which products sell the best together and offered a table + chairs listing combo on Amazon that immediately beat out other listings and drove increased sales to their brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, they are exploring additional product bundle launches on Amazon –– keeping their offerings on the marketplace and on their webstore different for the various audiences that shop on either one.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">If your brand is a fit to sell on Amazon, start doing so now. Amazon isn’t going anywhere –– and as they expand to additional markets and continue to invest in the latest and greatest in ecommerce innovation, your brand and products will be right there along for the ride.</p>
<p class="p1">20 years ago, had you invested, you’d be half a million dollars richer. Don’t let the opportunity pass you by again.</p>

<p class="p1">Whether it be through email campaigns, advertising or content marketing, brands must find a way to entice shoppers to buy – with their brand and at that moment – more so than ever before.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, we’re excited to share a new way BigCommerce merchants can make marketing campaigns even more successful — <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/buy-button/">the BigCommerce Buy Button</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Why We Built a Buy Button</h2>
<p class="p1">In 2015, there were a slew of announcements about Buy Buttons, which press wrote about as the next evolution of &#8216;social commerce.&#8217;</p>
<p class="p1">Fast forward 2 years and Buy Buttons haven&#8217;t yet taken off on social media, and brands continue to look for new, creative ways to sell products off-site –– making marketing campaigns and content more shoppable with less friction in the purchase process.</p>
<p class="p1">In those two years, it became clear that there was a need for a consolidated Buy Button brands themselves could own and launch. Giving brands the power, allows them to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Execute on campaigns more quickly, through both owned and third-party channels</li>
<li class="p1">Standardized reporting on Buy Button success across their company</li>
<li class="p1">Allow for various marketing and sales channel owners to use and launch buy buttons as needed</li>
<li class="p1">Customize Buy Button purchasing funnel flows as necessary for the campaign and in line with individual brand standards</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This follows the same logic as any emerging industry. At first, there are a disparate amount of options which later conglomerate into only a few, the most useful winning the lion’s share.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to Buy Buttons, that market is still relatively untapped –– forcing store owners and online marketers to use a variety of buttons across a variety of platforms with mixed reporting and analytics data to prove value.</p>
<p class="p1">Our engineers set out to fix that.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Install the BigCommerce Buy Button</h3></p>
<p class="p1">With a single click, BigCommerce customers can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/buy-buttons/">begin using the Buy Button right now</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">A Buy Button Built for Customization and Analytics</h2>
<p class="p1">Today, BigCommerce’s Buy Button officially launches within Channel Manager. Already, more than 400 online stores have installed the button and begun using it. We’ve interviewed many of them, worked through bugs and are now confident that the BigCommerce Buy Button is ready for the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">From a user perspective, the flow to create a card, button, or link is very intuitive. Plus, I love all the options already built-in. Having those customizations already there is really important because a lot of other platforms that have options to embed iframes are cookie-cutter. The amount of options on BigCommerce’s Buy Buttons is what really caught my attention at first.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, having the option to put Google tracking analytics or UTMs on it is really important to me. Honestly, inputs like that just plain make sense –– otherwise you wouldn’t be able to track success.</p>
<p class="p1">– Kyle Glaser, Founder and CEO, <a href="http://store.parkway.tv/">Parkway.tv</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The BigCommerce Buy Buttons allow shoppers to buy individual products right from your blog, website, emails and more. Now, you can make mini shopping experiences outside of your BigCommerce store to sell on other websites, in emails, through ads and on your own site, as needed.</p>

<p class="p1">This button is unlike those you will find elsewhere on the web –– whether it be on social media, in an email platform or even on another ecommerce platform provider.</p>
<p class="p1">First and foremost, they allow you to choose how you want to link the button. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">A card</li>
<li class="p1">A button</li>
<li class="p1">A link</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21038" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="302" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2.png 1389w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2-300x142.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2-750x354.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">From there, you can choose to send those who click on the card, button or link either to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Checkout page</li>
<li class="p1">Shopping cart</li>
<li class="p1">Product page</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21039" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="302" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1.png 1391w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1-300x142.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1-750x354.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">For the card and button options, you can choose to open the page in a pop-up window, on a new tab or in the same tab. In addition, you can add a UTM source code to track the performance of your Buy Buttons in both your BigCommerce and Google Analytics.</p>

<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21031" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="365" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1.png 1179w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1-300x171.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1-750x428.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And then you can dive deeper into that campaign tab, here:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21032" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4.png" alt="" width="640" height="256" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4.png 1111w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4-300x120.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4-750x300.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of how your Buy Button campaign UTM would appear on the backend.</em></p>
<p class="p1">In addition, Buy Button conversion will soon appear in the store performance dashboard, and  will display orders that come from <em>direct-to-checkout</em> links (which you can choose as you set up your buy button).</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21033" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics.png" alt="" width="640" height="301" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics.png 1110w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-300x141.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-750x353.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">Advanced Buy Button Customization and Analytics</h2>
<p class="p1">Beyond the basic UTM tagging, button-type choice and UX flow, we’ve also built in advanced features to allow for further customization to match your brand and better sync with your Google Analytics for goal and conversion tracking.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at how quickly I was able to customize the button just by playing around with it.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksEotH9IoQY" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">The Google Analytics ID is where you will input your <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en">Google Tracking ID</a> to track traffic, clicks and conversion on the button. Here is how you find your tracking ID:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Sign in to <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/web/#home/">your Analytics account</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">Click <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6132368">Admin</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">Select an account from the menu in the ACCOUNT column.</li>
<li class="p1">Select a property from the menu in the PROPERTY column.</li>
<li class="p1">Under PROPERTY, click Tracking Info &gt; Tracking Code.
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977">tracking ID and property number</a> are displayed at the top of the page.</li>
<li class="p1">Information about tracking apps is displayed under Mobile app tracking &#8211; <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7373305">Using the SDK</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">The <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6086097">tracking-code snippet</a> for your website is displayed under Website tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">The Google Analytics ID on the BigCommerce Buy Button now saves between sessions on the same device, so you only have to input it once.</p>
<h3 class="p7">User-Level Access and Usage</h3>
<p class="p1">At first install, the Buy Button is only available for account owners to use. You can edit this and allow additional members of your team to create their own buttons, cards or links as needed.</p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Store-Owner?q=user+accounts&amp;l=en_US&amp;fs=Search&amp;pn=1">Store Owner</a> can create / delete users and grant permissions from <a href="https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/settings/users">Account Settings › Users</a> under Single-Click Apps.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Install the BigCommerce Buy Button</h3></p>
<p class="p1">With a single click, BigCommerce customers can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/buy-buttons/">begin using the Buy Button right now</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">Where and How to Use the BigCommerce Buy Button</h2>
<p class="p1">There are a variety of use cases for the BigCommerce Buy Button and a few best practices for each. The most common ways the 412 brands already using the button are implementing it are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Email campaigns</li>
<li class="p1">Blogs</li>
<li class="p1">Affiliates, Influencers and Press</li>
<li class="p1">AdRoll</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Here are exactly how to use the BigCommerce Buy Buttons in each use case above, and recommended best practices.</p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Buttons + Email Campaigns</h3>
<p class="p1">Because email providers vary on how they serve up iFrames, we do not recommend you use the Button or Card option in any of your emails. If you do, it is likely that many of your customers will not see the button, and instead will see a blank space.</p>
<p class="p1">This is true even if the button shows up and works well in preview. This isn’t an iFrame issue, it is a permissions issue on the side of the user in their email account.</p>
<p class="p1">That said, you can use the Buy Button link option in your email CTA to push people directly to product page, cart or checkout page. Many email management systems, like MailChimp, provide their own buttons that you can customize, so all you need to do is drop in the BigCommerce generated link, and you’ll achieve a streamlined customer checkout experience.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21040" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email.png" alt="" width="640" height="241" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email.png 1395w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email-300x113.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email-750x282.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Depending on the ultimate goal of your email campaign, you may want to use various customer flows.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Checkout:</strong> Send customers direct to checkout if you are pushing customers to buy a single product “Right Now.” If you are using urgency or scarcity to drive up conversion, this is a good quick-to-checkout option, think flash sales, holiday sales, or “Only a Few Left in Stock!”</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Cart:</strong> Send customers direct to the shopping cart if you are looking to increase AOV from a particular customer cohort. For instance, if you have a Free Shipping offer running on banners across your site for orders over $100, send an email campaign that links to cart –– showing customers they only need $20 more of product to hit the free shipping threshold. You can easily set this up in the <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Using-Discount-Rules">discount tab on your BigCommerce backend</a>.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product page:</strong> Send customers direct to product page if you are introducing a new product, want to show off social proof or trying to drive additional traffic to a product page. Note that you may lose customers along the journey to conversion by starting higher in the funnel with this option. That said, if the customers are relatively new to your brand, this is a good option.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Remember, the best performing email campaigns only have 1 or 2 CTAs. Use the link within a CTA button provided through your email provider to track performance on your Google and BigCommerce Analytics.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>What Sending 100 Million Emails Taught Me About What Doesn’t Work</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/email-marketing-engagement-tips/">Noah Kagan details what works –– and what doesn’t –– when it comes to email marketing engagement.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Button + Blog</h3>
<p class="p1">The publishing industry has long had trouble working to monetize their efforts in the new digital age. Similarly, ecommerce brands have struggled to focus on content marketing efforts that don’t equally show off their product and push people back to conversion.</p>
<p class="p1">The transition between on-site content and checkout is often fraught with difficulties (and a bunch of various touchpoints that lose customers along the way).</p>
<p class="p1">With the BigCommerce Buy Button, you can eliminate that on your own blog and focus more on content marketing to drive traffic and increase your search engine ranking.</p>
<p class="p1">For this tactic, you can use any of the Buy Button options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Button</li>
<li class="p1">Card</li>
<li class="p1">Link</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You may even want to use various versions.</p>
<p class="p1">Some brands have used the Button option to advertise mentioned products throughout and at the end of posts. Here’s an example from the <a href="https://www.dvestore.com/">DVE Store</a>:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21035" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example.png" alt="" width="640" height="1429" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example.png 1395w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example-300x670.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example-750x1675.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You can also use the linking option to link out to products exactly where they are mentioned in posts, allowing the reader to click-to-purchase and strengthening your domain with interlining.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>The Content Strategy to 3x Sales</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/content-marketing-ecommerce-traffic/">One BigCommerce customer walks you through exactly what he did to 3x growth through content marketing alone. </a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Buttons + Affiliates, Influencers or Press Linking</h3>
<p class="p1">Many online brands use affiliates, influencers or the press to grow online awareness and push new customers to the site. The most important part of this type of work is being able to track the number of click-throughs and conversion in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Compensate affiliates or influencers properly</li>
<li class="p1">Determine which outlets work best for the brand (and then invest more heavily in those areas)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is where the UTM source and Google Analytics ID can be especially helpful. By giving influencers, affiliates and interested press the link to a product with these tracking mechanisms in place, you can track success across both your BigCommerce and Google Analytics.</p>
<p class="p1">The link option is most recommended here, but customer journey flow you use again depends on your desired outcome and audience.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Direct-to-checkout:</strong> This option is most useful when working with affiliates and influencers who send you the most qualified, ready-to-checkout traffic.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Direct-to-cart:</strong> This option is most useful for affiliates and influencers who send higher-funnel customers potentially looking for a Free Shipping or Discount offer at cart level.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product page:</strong> This most useful for press gift guide round ups, where consumers are still top of funnel and new to your brand, wanting to get to know you and your product before adding to cart.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Buttons + AdRoll</h3>
<p class="p1">Because of the built-in tracking mechanisms and the tracking mechanisms you can install on your site on the BigCommerce backend, you can use the links within AdRoll campaigns and track performance across those campaigns.</p>
<h3 class="p7">What are AdRoll campaigns?</h3>
<p class="p1">AdRoll campaigns are ads placed across the web to drive customers back to your site. You can use them to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">target net new customers</li>
<li class="p1">retarget site visitors</li>
<li class="p1">retarget existing customers to drive up AOV and lifetime loyalty</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">To add the AdRoll pixel to your BigCommerce site (which will track performance of the ads), you can install it in either the Google Analytics box in the BigCommerce control panel or the Footer Scripts box on Stencil if you are using a Stencil theme.</p>
<p class="p7"><strong>The Google Analytics Box in BigCommerce</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">People have to be able to find you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">In this way, Amazon works similarly to Google –– using an algorithm based search functionality that displays results for consumers based on a variety of factors.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike your webstore, however, getting found on Amazon is a constant battle.</p>
<p class="p1">You cannot build lifetime loyalty with your Amazon customers, meaning you can’t use email nurture streams to bring them back to you. Instead, you have to rely on search all the time.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">On Amazon, you have to rely on search – all the time.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">This makes it even more important that your products show up on page 1 of Amazon, and ideally in listing 1-3.</p>
<p class="p1">We worked with Amazon SEO expert Bryan Bowman in the Fall of 2016 to publish a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seo-strategy/">comprehensive, step-by-step guide to ranking on page 1 of Amazon</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">That content is invaluable, and it has helped hundreds of sellers increase their rankings and their sales on Amazon. In fact, we get emails pretty regularly telling us this.</p>
<p class="p1">Check it out (all SIC):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">I&#8217;d like to send you a big heart felt thank you for saving my business!</p>
<p class="p1">Up until April, I was selling approximately 18 units per day on Amazon. I noticed as I added more listings, my rank would increase and sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Then I noticed that my ranking fell from page 2 to page 8.</p>
<p class="p1">Sales and the sessions dropped by more than half, but my conversion rate was a still a healthy ~17%.</p>
<p class="p1">So I dropped my price to cost and cranked up the PPC. My rankings returned however it couldn&#8217;t be sustained</p>
<p class="p1">I was being out ranked by women&#8217;s corsets and listings that have been out of stock forever.</p>
<p class="p1">It wasn&#8217;t until I read your article &#8220;How To Master Amazon SEO&#8221; that I considered rearranging the Product Title. I didn&#8217;t consider that the keyword at the beginning of the title had more weight than any other words.</p>
<p class="p1">After I rearranged the title and, I fell to the floor with shock! I was on Page 1!</p>
<p class="p1">Have I wasted all this time by not updating the Product Title? So I rearranged the title, lowered the price and re-introduced PPC.</p>
<p class="p1">Sales and ranking returned.</p>
<p class="p1">THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">You can’t make up that kind of review –– and it got us over here at BigCommerce thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">How else can we help Amazon sellers sell more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">And to that, we’ve come up with a solution.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The ASIN Lookup Tool</h2>
<p class="p1">We worked with our product team to create an ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) lookup tool. After all, the Amazon ASIN database is open to the public, but not everyone knows how to leverage their API to look up a relevant ASIN number.</p>
<p class="p1">With this tool, you just drop in the link of the product, then do a reverse lookup based on the ASIN number of the product. We’ll email you the results, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">ASIN #</li>
<li class="p1">Detail Page URL</li>
<li class="p1">Title</li>
<li class="p1">Manufacturer</li>
<li class="p1">Label</li>
<li class="p1">Studio</li>
<li class="p1">Product Group</li>
<li class="p1">Product Type Name</li>
<li class="p1">EAN</li>
<li class="p1">Binding (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;ll make frequent updates to this tool to add more robust features, such as ISBN and other product identifiers.</p>
<p class="p1">But that leaves the million dollar question: how can this tool help grow your business? The answer — SEO!</p>
<h3 class="p1">Let’s take the Amazon seller’s example above…</h3>
<p class="p1">Had he been able to do a reverse ASIN lookup on Page 1 results for the search queries he wanted to rank for, he would have been able to see immediately that his product title was vastly different than the titles of ranking products. Plus, if applicable, he may have seen that his product group and product type name were also off.</p>
<p class="p1">All of these details are particularly important to Amazon’s search algorithm –– but are often hidden from view of regular web browsers.</p>
<p class="p1">Our new ASIN generator tool removes that layer –– emailing you all available information on a product the ranking of which you want to replicate.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Here is Your Free ASIN Lookup Tool</h2>
<p><iframe style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 3px; margin-left: 2.5%;" src="https://moar-tools-moar-progress.com/amazon/asin-tool.php" width="95%" height="400"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">Keep in mind, reviews matter a lot for Amazon SEO as well. Keywords and categorization alone won’t get you to the top, but they will certainly help.</p>
<p class="p1">Many Amazon sellers have long been wondering how to get an Amazon ASIN number, and an easy solution has finally arrived.</p>

<p class="p1">Jeff Cohen of Seller Labs walks you through all the reasons why, and even maybe why not, you’d want to launch a webstore to supplement your Amazon business. The best reason he finds is so that you don’t get cut off at the ankles.</p>
<h3 class="p4"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ShopTalk-Amazon-Handout-2754-6x9-print-booklet-AK.pdf">Amazon Pay Drives 20% of Sales</a></h3>
<p class="p1">Within 2 weeks of implementing, multiple BigCommerce customers are seeing more than 20% of their customers checkout through Amazon Pay. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ShopTalk-Amazon-Handout-2754-6x9-print-booklet-AK.pdf">Here’s what they have to say</a>:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Increased mobile conversion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“By building these integrations with companies like Amazon Pay, BigCommerce provides non-household brands, like me, instant credibility. This equals a clear path to ~5% conversion rates on mobile with over 80% of sales on mobile.” – Brandon Chatham, NatoMounts</p>
<p class="p1">“The Amazon Pay button has been great, especially with our mobile device customers. Mobile customers are looking for easier ways to shop and the Amazon Pay button offers that. We’ve seen a considerable gain in mobile-based sales since we’ve implemented it.” – Mark Hawley, Metal Tech 4&#215;4</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Immediate ROI</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“We converted a $2,000 sale in the first couple of hours after implementation, and we are seeing steady usage of the Amazon Pay option.” – Spiro Alafassos, Play Better</p>
<p class="p1">“Amazon Pay was quick and easy to set up on BigCommerce, and after two weeks, 26% of our orders were processed by Amazon Pay.” – Tim Lorang, Power Support International</p>
<p class="p1">“We&#8217;ve seen a 25% increase in transactions coming in from Amazon Pay since implementing the solution.” – Eric Jones, Couture Candy</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Ease of setup</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“The implementation was a breeze with BigCommerce and Amazon working together. It was a seamless process done in short order by a non-technical site owner, i.e., me!” – Mark Hawley, Metal Tech 4&#215;4</p>
<p class="p1">“The implementation process was fairly easy. Now, on any given day, we&#8217;re seeing between 30–50% of all orders choosing to use the Amazon Pay button over other methods of checkout.” – Jeff Jan, Solo Stove</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Reduced friction at checkout</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“The goal of our website is to make it easier for customers to do business with us. The Amazon Pay button allows customers to use their already established Amazon account to make a payment quickly and easily.” – Mark Hawley, Metal Tech 4&#215;4</p>
<p class="p1">“We added the Amazon Pay button to give customers more choice. We know that a lot of people shop on Amazon so it made sense to allow them to use their Amazon-stored info to make purchasing on our site easier.” – Jeff Jan, Solo Stove</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>More trust, fewer errors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Amazon Pay gives our customers a recognized and trusted payment option that will help us increase conversions.” – Spiro Alafassos, Play Better</p>
<p class="p1">“Having the address information curated from the customer&#8217;s Amazon account significantly reduces the amount of invalid shipping addresses. When I added that as an option, our shipping people noticed the decrease the next day.” – Chris Bair, Ketochow</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Improved payment choices</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“From a branding perspective, we feel Amazon Pay is more appealing than other options and offers a better long-term merchant processing solution.” – Eric Jones, Couture Candy</p>
<p class="p1">“I absolutely recommend Amazon Pay. It&#8217;s the same transactional cost as most other payment processors. Plus, it was simple to set up. I don&#8217;t see a good reason not to do it! More payment options for customers can only be a win.” – Chris Bair, Ketochow</p>
<p class="p1">“It&#8217;s still early, but we think the Amazon Pay option will be very successful for us. We will be promoting the new option on our site, our social platforms, and to our email list. We believe it may become our most used payment option.” – Spiro Alafassos, Play Better</p>

<h2 class="p1">Instagram by the Numbers</h2>
<p class="p1">When it comes to Instagram, ecommerce businesses by and large recommend the platform. Whether you are advertising, building an audience or both – Instagram has fueled hundreds of thousands in sales. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>600M</strong> — Number of monthly active Instagram users. (Source: <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/154506585127/161215-600million">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>400M</strong> — Number of daily active users (Source: <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/4041792-facebook-fb-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">Facebook</a>)
<ul>
<li class="p1">Increased from 300 to 400M in just seven months*</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>5X</strong> — Instagram growth rate compared to overall social network usage in the U.S. (Source: <a href="http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/25-amazing-stats-you-need-to-know-about-instagram.html">Inc.</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>25</strong> — Percent more likely it is that Instagram users are in the top income quartile than average Internet users. (<a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/infographic-globalwebindex-messenger/">Source: GlobalWebIndex</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>5M</strong> —  Number of active Instagram business profiles (Source: <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/4041792-facebook-fb-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">Facebook</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>60</strong> — Percent of people who say they discover new products on Instagram (Source:  <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>70</strong> — Percent of users who follow a business on Instagram (Source: <a href="https://business.instagram.com/">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>75</strong> — Percent of users who take an action after seeing a business post (i.e. visit a website, search, shop or tell a friend) (Source: <a href="http://blog.business.instagram.com/post/150771324916/instagram-advertiser-number">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>500,000</strong> — Instagram advertisers (Source: <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/4041792-facebook-fb-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">Facebook</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>150M</strong>— Number of daily active Instagram Stories users just 5 months after launch (Source: <a href="http://blog.business.instagram.com/post/155717870326/business-insights-and-ads-in-stories">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>33</strong> — Percent of the most viewed Instagram Stories come from business accounts (Source: <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>36</strong> — Percent of B2C brands that consider Instagram to be “very important” or “critical” to their social media marketing, compared to 13% of B2B brands (Source: <a href="http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/25-amazing-stats-you-need-to-know-about-instagram.html">Inc.</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The data above makes it clear that when Instagram launches a new product for its users and business accounts, it gets used. And with a feature that both Instagram users an businesses marketing on Instagram have been asking for (i.e. product links in feeds rather than just the bio) – it is sure to take off.</p>

<h2 class="p3">How Instagram Shopping Will Work</h2>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce will be one of the first ecommerce platforms to integrate with Instagram. Through the integration, you will be able to build shoppable photos that feature your products, allowing followers (and others!) to discover and browse natively on Instagram, then easily access your online store to complete their purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Once enabled, up to five products and their prices can be featured in any photo in your feed. To access, users simply click on a product to bring up a detailed view and description of it. From the product details view, shoppers can click a ‘Shop Now’ button to go right to your site and purchase the product, delivering you the most qualified shoppers.</p>

<p class="p1">At launch, only Instagram-approved merchants in the Fashion, Apparel, Jewelry and Beauty/Skincare categories will be able to use the integration. To get started, let us know you are interested, and you will be added to the waitlist for Instagram approval.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is how the process will work:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/instagram">Get approved by Instagram</a></li>

<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/356902681064399">Connect Instagram to your Facebook business page</a></li>
<li class="p1">Enable the integration through the BigCommerce Channel Manager</li>
<li class="p1">You’ll see an option to tag products from your product catalog in the Instagram app on iOS or Android</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">The Instagram channel will be available to all eligible BigCommerce businesses starting in Q2 2017. In the meantime, we are working with select customers to test the feature and ensure the best possible experience for our customers.</p>
<p class="p1">For now, brands selling in the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/showcase/clothing/">Fashion, Apparel, Jewelry</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/showcase/health-beauty/">Beauty/Skincare categories</a> should continue to build out their Instagram audiences.</p>

<h3 class="p5">What is your #1 priority in creating an engaging Instagram business profile?</h3>
<p class="p1">If I had to pick the most important thing, I would say the pictures need to feel genuine. Posts that feel over “photo-shopped” often lack an authenticity that is really critical to connecting with your audience. Find a style that works for you and post often, i.e. 3 to 5 times a day.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What advice would you offer other online businesses looking to grow on Instagram?</h3>
<p class="p1">The most important advice is be very particular about what you post. If your feed lacks a cohesive feel, your audience will have a hard time relating to your content.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you have a clear aesthetic that is resonating with your audience, network with other Instagrammers with a similar size audience. In our early days on Instagram, we did a lot of “friendly follows” with other Instagram accounts that we respected and that were a good fit for our audience.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What has your experience advertising on Instagram been like and what advice would you give to others?</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Instagram is a great organic audience for us and we have run conversion ads using our most engaging posts.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">We have had great results with acquiring new customers through Instagram advertising. Instagram is a great organic audience for us and we have run conversion ads using our most engaging posts.</p>
<p class="p1">Our best advice is experiment thoughtfully. Have a plan for what you are trying to accomplish and come up with goals for each metric you track (engagement, conversions, etc). Review your ads performance frequently while you are perfecting your audience and content.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Instagram has announced upcoming Instagram Shopping features. How do you think letting your customers shop your catalog on Instagram will change your business?</h3>
<p class="p1">We have used a shopp-able Instagram feed for nearly a year now through StoryBox and it has been a good investment for us. That being said, we are really looking forward to using the native shopping functionality for Instagram marketing, as we believe that it will be one more way that we can make purchasing from us easier.</p>
<p class="p1">We have a highly engaged Instagram audience and we are anxious to make our Instagram shopping experience even more seamless.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p5">What are the top priorities in creating an engaging Instagram business profile?</h3>
<p class="p1">There are many things we do to dominate on Instagram. Here are a few:</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1) We post 8-10 times per day, 7 days a week, so there is always fresh content to be seen by our fans.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Some are product images, some are lifestyle shots, some are funny videos. We like to mix it up!</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2) We offer Instagram photo contests and giveaways for customers to win free merchandise or a gift card!</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">A customer has to tag their friends and share one of our contest posts and we will pick a random winner every week! Everybody loves free stuff, so this is always a popular promotion for us.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3)  We ship all items to our customers in a custom poly mailer bag to drive user-generated content.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">The bag has our logo and our own exclusive hashtag for customers to tag us on Instagram when they take a selfie in their new outfit.  If customers post a selfie on Instagram wearing our clothes and tag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/pinklilystyle/">#pinklilystyle</a>, they will be featured on the front page of our website. This has been a great promotion. Customers love the idea of being featured on a website that has 25,000 visitors per day.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20230" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram.png" alt="pink-lily-instagram" width="640" height="840" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram.png 712w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-300x394.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20229" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-1.png" alt="pink-lily-instagram-1" width="640" height="248" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-1.png 1904w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-1-300x116.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-1-750x291.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4)  We let our customers choose which items we buy.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">When shopping for new items or attending a market, we let the customers &#8216;Be the buyer.&#8217; We take pictures of the items we are considering and then we post them to our social media pages, asking our fans to &#8216;be the buyer&#8217; and let us know what they think about particular items.</p>
<p class="p1">For example we will post a picture holding a dress in each hand and ask the customer &#8216;Which dress do you like best? Left or right?&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">This not only gives us a look at the specific buying habits of our customer, but our fans feel great knowing that we value their input and we try and stock our website based on the items that they truly want.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20231" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-2.png" alt="pink-lily-instagram-2" width="640" height="434" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-2.png 965w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-2-300x203.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-2-750x508.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p5">What advice would you offer other online businesses looking to grow on Instagram?</h3>
<p class="p1">Keep your customers engaged! Ask their opinions, give away items, make them laugh, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">An engaged fan is more likely to turn into a customer. Make sure they know that you value their input and want them to be extremely satisfied with their purchase.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What has your experience advertising on Instagram been like and what advice would you give to others?</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Look at it from the customer’s viewpoint and ask yourself, &#8220;Would I click on this ad?&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">We currently are advertising on Instagram and the results have been positive. It’s all about the image and the message.</p>
<p class="p1">You only have a couple seconds for a customer to decide whether or not they are going to click on that ad.  Make sure you put a lot of thought into what type of picture, wording, design, etc that you will be using. Look at it from the customer’s viewpoint and ask yourself, &#8220;Would I click on this ad?&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="p5">Instagram has announced upcoming Instagram Shopping features. How do you think letting your customers shop your catalog on Instagram will change your business?</h3>
<p class="p1">This is great! We currently use a third-party platform to turn our Instagram feed into shoppable content. It will be nice to be able to do it straight from Instagram and BigCommerce going forward.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Shark Tank Success to Instagram Fandom</h2>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grace-and-lace-instagram.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20225" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grace-and-lace-instagram.png" alt="grace and lace instagram" width="640" height="499" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grace-and-lace-instagram.png 897w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grace-and-lace-instagram-300x234.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grace-and-lace-instagram-750x584.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">With more than <a href="https://www.instagram.com/graceandlaceco/?hl=en">44,000 Instagram followers</a>, Grace &amp; Lace was skyrocketed to household name when they appeared on Shark Tank. Today, the team uses Instagram to connect with their audience and fans across the country.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is their best advice on how to grow a loyal base.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How Grace &amp; Lace Manages Inventory Across Channels</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Selling so much through Instagram and other channels including Facebook and Pinterest can be challenging. <a href="http://www.skuvault.com/resources/casestudies/grace-and-lace">Here’s how the Grace &amp; Lace team figured it all out. </a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p5">What are the top priorities in creating an engaging Instagram business profile?</h3>
<p class="p1">For us, we work to strike a balance between promoting our products, giving our fans a behind the scenes look at Grace &amp; Lace, sharing my life as a mom, wife, and entrepreneur, and adding a little levity or inspiration to their week.</p>
<p class="p1">We try to build a valuable relationship with our fans so that when they’re ready to buy something they can’t try on first or see in person, they have had positive interactions with our brand online and they trust me and Grace &amp; Lace enough to take that leap of faith.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What advice would you offer other online businesses looking to grow on Instagram?</h3>
<p class="p1">Tell your story. Facts tell, stories sell.</p>
<p class="p1">Successful brands drive engagement with a story or an experience around their products. Stories enable us to create a connection not only with our fans but with a new audience.</p>
<p class="p1">Instagram is a powerhouse for you to visually tell that story and showcase that experience. It’s not about marketing your product; it’s about marketing the experience that comes with owning your product.</p>
<p class="p1">Most products we sell are shot on a mannequin first. We’ve tested and 100% of the time, a model photo, flat lay, or even a selfie photo gets more engagement than a mannequin photo.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s the same product, but a shot of the model walking down the street on a pretty day shows an experience. The flat lay complete with accessories shows an experience. The selfie shows an experience. And don’t get sidelined by ‘the gear’ involved in taking great photos. It’s not about the gear. It’s about connecting people to your story, to the experience, of your company.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What has your experience advertising on Instagram been like and what advice would you give to others?</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Compared to Facebook, Instagram has much less clutter in the newsfeed which makes the ad feel more native and increases engagement.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Instagram advertising can be powerful and it doesn’t necessarily have to be expensive. Compared to Facebook, Instagram has much less clutter in the newsfeed which makes the ad feel more native and increases engagement.</p>
<p class="p1">The best piece of advice I can offer is to use the targeting to your advantage. Use current shopper data to create the ‘person’ most likely to engage with your ad. If your typical customer is a middle aged woman from the Midwest, target your ad specifically to that type of person so you aren’t showing the same ad to a male college student in Florida who will never buy.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Instagram has announced upcoming Instagram Shopping features. How do you think letting your customers shop your catalog on Instagram will change your business?</h3>
<p class="p1">Instagram shopping is a game changer. Browsing and discovering things you love is very easy on Instagram. Finding more information on those things you love can sometimes be a task, especially on mobile. The more barriers you put between the consumer and your product, the better the chance they will get distracted and move on.</p>
<p class="p1">There are solutions that have bridged the gap well for us, but making that process more fluid will give Grace &amp; Lace fans and prospective fans a more seamless way to engage with our brand. With Instagram shopping we can build on the piqued interest of a potential customer natively through Instagram and help customers move seamlessly from discovery to purchase.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Prepping for a Shoppable Instagram to Drive Sales</h2>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nickelandsuede.png"><img class="wp-image-20228 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nickelandsuede.png" alt="nickelandsuede" width="640" height="471" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nickelandsuede.png 944w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nickelandsuede-300x221.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nickelandsuede-750x552.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">With more than <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nickelandsuede/">34,000 Instagram followers</a>, Nickel &amp; Suede admits they began on Instagram early –– and have long been awaiting shoppable posts to make Instagram advertising as successful as Facebook’s.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is their best advice on how to grow a large following and advertise effectively.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What are some tactics you’ve used to create an engaging Instagram business profile?</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Our followers appreciate using IG as a platform where they can get to know us without scouring our website.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">When we started Nickel &amp; Suede, Instagram was still growing in popularity and we knew that it was somewhere we needed to have a strong presence. We started off by networking and collaborating with other brands that we related to and that was a big initial boost at a time when users were first creating IG accounts and choosing who to follow.</p>
<p class="p1">We quickly found that the biggest struggle was having enough continually engaging, high-quality content. We&#8217;ve worked hard to create great imagery to share with our followers that is informative and personal. We try to keep our followers updated in real-time with information about new releases, behind the scenes and sneak peeks.</p>
<p class="p1">We also try to think of our audience as “new” every couple of months so we shift to introducing ourselves every so often or sharing little “did you know” bits about us. We think our followers appreciate using IG as a platform where they can get to know us without scouring our website.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What advice would you offer other online businesses looking to grow on Instagram?</h3>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s been interesting to find a balance for our business on a platform like Instagram because most of its users are there and have been there for personal reasons. They want to connect with friends and family there and so finding a way to fit your business into someone&#8217;s personal feed is a hard thing to do.</p>
<p class="p1">So, my advice is first, you have to have great images. Whether you take them with your phone or your camera, make sure they are interesting and high quality. What you say in your caption also matters, but the picture is what sells you.</p>
<p class="p1">Second, I would suggest finding ways to keep the platform personal to your customer. Find ways to make them feel like an insider. Offer behind the scenes shots or share something personal about employees. Don&#8217;t make it all about selling. Instagram users need a personal reason to follow a business.</p>
<p class="p1">That being said, Instagram has been shifting and changing over the last year. It is becoming more like Facebook in that it is slightly less personal and will soon have more ways to boost for businesses.</p>
<p class="p1">Follower growth is slower than ever right now, but we don&#8217;t think it will stay that way. We are sure Instagram will slowly become an even better and better place for businesses to be. And when they start offering more ways to advertise and easier ways to sell through the platform, it will be pay to play. It will be worth it just like it&#8217;s worth it to pay to play on Facebook.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What has your experience advertising on Instagram been like and what advice would you give to others?</h3>
<p class="p1">We are currently advertising on Instagram, but only a little bit. Our Facebook ads run on Instagram as well, but we don&#8217;t see the same kind of conversion on IG as we do on Facebook.</p>
<p class="p1">We think that advertising on Instagram will eventually be very lucrative, but we don&#8217;t have a strategy for that currently. There are still more features we&#8217;d like to see added to allow shopping from Instagram.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Instagram has announced upcoming Instagram Shopping features. How do you think letting your customers shop your catalog on Instagram will change your business?</h3>
<p class="p1">Speaking of adding features, yes, we&#8217;re excited about these! It has previously been so difficult to shop a specific item you see featured on Instagram that I think there is huge anticipation for this. We believe that our customers will really respond well to this feature and we&#8217;ll start seeing many more conversions from IG to our website checkout.</p>

<p class="p1">If you want to increase ROI on Instagram – or any channel for that matter – figure out how to use the platform the way consumers use it. If you&#8217;re salesy, people are going hate you. But, you&#8217;re engaging, it will go a long way in terms of bringing you real, lasting customers.</p>

<p class="p1">Just like Facebook, prioritize your audience targeting in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Custom audiences</li>
<li class="p1">Lookalike audiences</li>
<li class="p1">Saved audiences</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">People who know you (custom audiences) are going to usually provide a higher and quicker ROI compared to the people who&#8217;ve never seen you before (saved audiences).</p>
<p class="p1">We try to max out the Instagram audience potential with custom audiences first, then lookalike, and then saved audiences last.</p>
<p class="p1">As we start targeting audiences that are colder and colder, we also focus on changing the call to action to match that audience temperature.</p>
<p class="p1">Someone who hasn&#8217;t of us before won&#8217;t pull out their credit card if our product isn&#8217;t novel, so our best bet is to get them to sign up for something that&#8217;s higher up our funnel.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">If it&#8217;s anything like the success from Google Shopping, then it will be huge, but it won&#8217;t be the same.</p>
<p class="p1">I see this more of a Pinterest-style rollout that will certainly be very interesting to test, but will require stores to rely more on talent of photography and not shopping feeds.</p>

<p class="p1">Besides your visual creative, finding and narrowing down on a highly engaged audience is key to driving success on Instagram. I like to start off with retargeted audiences, then scale up to a lookalike audience of the base retargeted audience and finally use Facebook ads&#8217; demographic and interests targeting to create custom audiences that I split test.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Instagram Shopping will be especially useful for retargeting ads and for shopping cart recovery. I think conversions from impulse purchases by audiences that have just discovered your brand via Instagram will be low. But the big opportunity will likely come from audiences that have initially engaged with ecommerce brands on their websites.</p>

<p class="p1">Experiment with some of the apps that let you tie photos to product pages. This makes Instagram more of a direct path to purchase, which is easier to track and assess ROI.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">The success of Instagram Shopping comes down to their execution. Twitter announced ecommerce years ago and it was a dud. I&#8217;m optimistic here, though, because the medium is so visual. I think they will make impulse priced items a real possibility. Where else today can you really sell an impulse item other than on your own site to your own traffic?</p>

<p class="p1">Use images of real people. It’s super simple, but it has a huge effect on your click-through-rate which in turn increases your relevant score. Also, the more clicks you get, the lower your cost-per-acquisition will be, and thus your return on investment will increase.</p>
<p class="p1">People are gregarious, and we rely heavily on what other people do and tend to follow the crowd. Using images of real people along with your product establishes a more personal relationship between brand and consumer which makes people more inclined to click the ad.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">I really love Instagram shopping. You now have the possibility to show images of your products without having to link to them in your bio. This is a feature I’ve really been looking forward to.</p>
<p class="p1">I used to work as an ecommerce manager at a furniture and interior design ecommerce store, where we would show beautiful images of our products in different environments to illustrate how you could use them. The problem was that people couldn’t just click the image and buy the product. We had to list every single item on the image correctly according to the product name on the website. This quickly becomes a problem if you have many products in one image. Moreover, users had to click the link in our bio, and search for the product on the website and then buy it. That process is way too complicated, and most users will drop off before completing the purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">The new feature allows you to tag your products in the images and then users can click on the product on the image and be sent directly to the product page where they can buy it.</p>
<p class="p1">Instagram advertising now has the potential to become more than just a retargeting platform for ecommerce. You can do push advertising and reach out to cold leads with awesome images of your products in use.</p>
<p class="p1">You should always use images where you show your products in their “natural” environment instead of just showing a simple product image. For instance, if you sell furniture, you should decorate an entire room with different furniture to show how everything goes together, which can also increase additional sales.</p>

<p class="p1">Make it a no-brainer to try it out. If you have a physical product, make it a &#8220;free trial&#8221; where you send a sample and the customer only covers shipping. This works even better if you&#8217;re selling a subscription.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s unlikely someone will make a decision to spend a lot of money based on an Instagram ad, but if you can give them a taste of the product it&#8217;s a lot easier to convince them of the big purchase later on.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">I can&#8217;t speak for their effect on anyone else, but I can say anecdotally that Instagram ads have been far more effective for me than any other social media advertising. I&#8217;ve downloaded something like four apps and bought health supplements because of Instagram ads.</p>
<p class="p1">The easier Instagram can make it to capture both attention and money within the app, the more powerful the service will be for retailers.</p>

<p class="p1">Develop a <a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/instagram-marketing-tips/#tip10">content strategy for Instagram</a> on what you will post, both for organic and paid ads. You should be able to answer what value your audience will receive from you. Will your pictures educate your fans? How so? Will you strive to entertain them? In what ways? Or will you seek to inspire your audience?</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">I believe Instagram Shopping is going to be huge for ecommerce businesses. Pinterest has already proven this to be a successful model. The average order value of sales coming from Pinterest is $50. Thinking about that in terms of Instagram, <a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/instagram-engagement-rate/">Yotpo found</a> Instagram engagement rates were 45% longer than visitors from Facebook, 62% longer than visitors from Pinterest, and 40% longer than visitors from Twitter.</p>

<p class="p1">Pay attention to the trends. There are hashtag days, like #TBT (throwback Thursday) for example, that can help augment the reach of your brand if you leverage the right tags at the right time. But make sure the audience using the tag matches your target audience!</p>
<p class="p1">Doing keyword research on Instagram is absolutely necessary. Don&#8217;t just assume that hashtags from Twitter will be the same conversations on Instagram –– they&#8217;re often very different. Also, make use of the new features Instagram releases, like the recently released scroll function that allows you to use multiple pictures in a set.</p>
<p class="p1">Give your audience exactly all the information they need right in the app itself (including payment processing, if you have items to sell). The more work you make your audience do, the more barriers to buy you&#8217;re unintentionally creating.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Shopping on Instagram as it exists today is a bit cumbersome. Importantly, there&#8217;s one huge barrier to buying: no PayPal integration! This means that users making an often impulsive purchase decision in the Instagram App don&#8217;t have the ability to 1-click-to-buy. Instead, they have to have a physical credit card on them to input during the checkout process.</p>
<p class="p1">A smoother purchase funnel will definitely alleviate this pain point, and lead to a smoother buying process for brands on Instagram selling their goods.</p>

<p class="p1">Share images a user would share. Instagram is an environment where people engage with friends, not brands. Images should not only grab attention, but they should look like they are coming from a real person. No stock photos or produced graphics/charts/logos etc.</p>

<p class="p1">My #1 piece of advice for brands to increase ROI from Instagram ads is making sure to target the right audience. Instagram lets you target by demographics, location, interest, and much more.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">I&#8217;m actually quite excited to try it out for myself. I love how seamlessly integrated it is and how you can showcase the product and price upfront. Many consumers want to know as much about the product before they head to buy. In a world where many people have a short attention span, this HELPS!</p>

<p class="p1">Instagram is all about engagement. The platform gives users a peek into the daily lives (albeit a highly stylized version) of others. So from an advertiser standpoint building engagement means presenting a view into the lifestyle that your brand represents. Your product will resonate if viewers see it fitting into their imagined day to day. The trick is to paint a picture that&#8217;s not too out there, but just a touch more exciting than their current reality.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to retail, especially online, distribution is king. The products with the best and widest distribution models may not always win, but they often have the best odds. Instagram Shopping is yet another highly engaging direct to consumer distribution channel that may prove very fruitful for savvy brands.</p>

<p class="p1">The key to generating more ROI from Instagram ads is to make sure your relevance is backed up by a well curated collection of content that&#8217;s in line with what you&#8217;re promoting. Your ads are designed to summon engagement from a particular group of targeted users so it behooves you to make sure their follow-up actions lead to more engagement either on your Instagram profile, website or maybe even your page feed. Focus your attention not on the ad itself but also the entire lifecycle of the ad.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Instagram Shopping is yet another reimagining of how retail is evolving and how merchants must adapt their resources to access customers. Instagram Shopping will likely become very successful for established brands with large followings.</p>
<p class="p1">For smaller and less established brands, the process of acquiring followers, adapting the actual store to handle checkout workflows, order abandonments, adjusting the customer lifecycle funnels, and creating enough content to make Instagram Shopping successful still needs proof of concept. For the majority of stores in the marketplace today, Instagram Shopping should hold as a very interesting feature for now.</p>

<p class="p1">Test a micro-conversion on your Instagram landing page. And if you’re not creating a landing page, optimized for mobile, which is unique to your Instagram offer, start there.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you have your LP, the micro conversion has two possible ROI boosting benefits: 1) <a href="https://klientboost.com/cro/online-form/">Data has shown</a> that micro conversions imitate the conversion in a less threatening way and increase overall conversions. 2) If you get a contact method you can remarked to those leads later and potentially boost overall sales.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">All in all, Instagram continues to be a high-growth social platform for many online brands. High-quality imagery and A/B testing of advertising that inspires and engages (rather than just sells) are what take you to the top.</p>
<p class="p1">The Instagram Shopping feature will be a valuable addition to your Instagram arsenal of tools to grow your fanbase and get your products in their hands.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="2000" height="920" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/inventory-count-management-hero.png" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/inventory-count-management-hero.png 2000w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/inventory-count-management-hero-300x138.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/inventory-count-management-hero-750x345.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p class="p1">Inventory management is a crucial element of running an ecommerce business, but it can be one of the most difficult and technical parts of the job to learn.</p>
<p class="p1">The simple process of keeping track of goods purchased and sold is complicated by costs, overhead, rate of sale or turnover, cost of purchase, and other details that can be difficult to manage as your online sales grow.</p>
<p class="p1">However, you need <a href="http://ecommercetips.org/3-problems-with-amazon-inventory-management/">accurate inventory management</a> to maintain the profitability of your store, as inventory carrying costs can represent <a href="https://www.skubana.com/e-commerce/understanding-sku-growth-how-increasing-inventory-affects-costs-management/">as much as 25% of your inventory value</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition, poor management, which results in out of stock events and overstocking, can be costly.</p>
<p class="p1">Overstocking means you could get stuck paying for storage and management for items you might never sell, while selling out loses customers, can slow shipping time, and reduce customer satisfaction.</p>
<p class="p1">This is especially relevant for Amazon sellers, whose listings and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seo-strategy/">Amazon SEO will plummet if a product is out of stock</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Maintaining an accurate inventory count allows you to manage reorders, keep just enough inventory in stock to meet demand, and reduce costs by understanding your sales and losses.</p>
<p class="p1">While there are numerous elements of your inventory that will require care, you can start by ensuring that your physical inventory counts are accurate, so that the rest of your data is correct as well.</p>
<h1 class="p2">How to Physically Organize Your Inventory</h1>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/factory-700588_960_720.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20148" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/factory-700588_960_720.jpg" alt="factory-700588_960_720" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/factory-700588_960_720.jpg 960w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/factory-700588_960_720-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/factory-700588_960_720-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The first step to accurate inventory counts is simply organizing your inventory. While very small ecommerce stores often skip this step, it becomes more and more crucial as your inventory grows.</p>
<p class="p1">Organization allows you to understand what you have, how you are keeping track of it, and gain a better understanding of your data once you perform a count.</p>
<p class="p1">The first element of organizing your inventory should almost always be physical organization.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Label bins</li>
<li class="p1">Create a structured order</li>
<li class="p1">Integrate an inventory movement system such as “first in, last out” or “last in first out.”</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">This will enable you to<a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-warehousing/"> track where items are in your warehouse</a> and handle counts more quickly.</p>
<p class="p1">Great organization necessitates a quality inventory control system comprised of detailed labelling and naming.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Inventory Labeling</h2>
<p class="p1">Using physical labels gives you the opportunity to improve the accuracy of your inventory count using technology like barcode scanners. Even if you manufacture all your products yourself, you should have a physical labelling system that matches your digital inventory count.</p>
<p class="p1">Your label should include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">SKU (Stock-Keeping-Unit)</li>
<li class="p1">UPC/EAN</li>
<li class="p1">Measurements</li>
<li class="p1">Location, if applicable</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">Inventory Naming</h2>
<p class="p1">You need quality, organized inventory names to track and manage your inventory and stock levels. In most cases, this means using or creating SKU numbers to track your internal inventory while adopting and using other technology for efficiency and retail sale.</p>
<p class="p1">You also need actual product names, which should be descriptive based on product type, size, color, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">Many of us are tempted to create product names that are semantic, but good inventory  management means creating titles that are searchable.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Semantic:</strong> Blue Chuck Taylor Converse Shoes</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Searchable:</strong> Converse, Chuck Taylor, Blue, Size 8.5</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Why? If you’re attempting to perform a manual update and you’re using &#8220;Blue Converse Shoes,&#8221; your shoes would be located under &#8220;Blue&#8221; and not under &#8220;Converse.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">By creating a non-semantic naming system, you can categorize the most important part of the product first. It also makes performing inventory counts easier, because you can more easily see what a product is.</p>
<h2 class="p4">SKU</h2>
<p class="p1">A SKU is the smallest saleable unit of any inventory (for example a pack of paper cups or a vacuum) and allows you to track internal goods and quantities. If you don’t have your own SKUs, create them today and start using them for inventory tracking.</p>
<p class="p1">A good SKU is descriptive of the product, between 4 and 14 characters long, does not contain special symbols, and is unique.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, using a simple first letter and product number system, you could create SKUs like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Chocolate bar – SKU: CB001</li>
<li class="p1">Chocolate bar, vanilla – SKU: CB001-01</li>
<li class="p1">Chocolate bar, hazelnut – SKU: CB001-02</li>
<li class="p1">Toffee – SKU: T002</li>
<li class="p1">Toffee, Caramel – SKU: T002-01</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This type of system allows you to neatly organize everything in your system in alphanumeric order. This improves the accuracy of your counts by ensuring that you can clearly see what each item is, and what variation.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, if you were to start an SKU off like 0001ABC you would have no way to find the SKU with a sort function, and you can’t tell what it is at a glance.</p>
<p class="p1">SKUs allow you to update the number of physical units you have available for sale, and organize everything into your own system that makes sense for your company.</p>
<p class="p1">They also make it easy to handle physical organization using either alphabetical or numerical organization. For example, if you use a system that values each SKU based on when it was added to your system (First: 0001, Last, 12987, you can easily structure and organize your entire warehouse.</p>
<p class="p1">If your warehouse is large enough, and you manage all your inventory from a single location, you can also add location to your SKUs. However, this is not recommended if you use Amazon FBA, a third-party logistics company, or another type of external fulfilment.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to Create SKUs in BigCommerce</h3>
<p class="p1">There are multiple ways to create SKUs in the BigCommerce platform. There are two main options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Import products and SKUs from an excel file</li>
<li class="p1">Create custom SKUs on a per product basis</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For those wanting to create custom SKUs on a per product basis, you have a few options. Each product within BigCommerce can have more than 500 variants or options. This means 500 various SKUs for a single product type. Of course, you can also have a single product with no options, as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is how you set that up.</p>
<p class="p1">Navigate to your products page in the BigCommerce platform. Click &#8220;Add.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce.png"><img class="wp-image-20144 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce.png" alt="add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce" width="650" height="414" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce.png 1150w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce-300x191.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce-750x477.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Now, where you add in your SKU will depend on if you have a single variant or option for your product, or multiple.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce.png"><img class="wp-image-20145 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce.png" alt="how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce" width="650" height="380" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce.png 1159w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce-300x175.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce-750x438.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If you have multiple options or variants for each product, you have two options in adding SKUs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Custom </strong></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Custom-SKUs-BigCommerce.png"><img class="wp-image-20142 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Custom-SKUs-BigCommerce.png" alt="Custom-SKUs-BigCommerce" width="650" height="362" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Custom-SKUs-BigCommerce.png 1150w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Custom-SKUs-BigCommerce-300x167.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Custom-SKUs-BigCommerce-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Auto-generated</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/auto-generated-SKUs-BigCommerce.png"><img class="wp-image-20143 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/auto-generated-SKUs-BigCommerce.png" alt="auto-generated-SKUs-BigCommerce" width="650" height="354" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/auto-generated-SKUs-BigCommerce.png 1140w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/auto-generated-SKUs-BigCommerce-300x163.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/auto-generated-SKUs-BigCommerce-750x409.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p4">Units of Measure</h2>
<p class="p1">You can add units of measure into your SKUs or product labelling system to track how much of any given item you have, making it easy to perform counts.</p>
<p class="p1">By ensuring that you have approved units of measure, you can create a system that allows you to track SKU volume using a simple and efficient method.</p>
<p class="p1">Common measurements include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Unit</li>
<li class="p1">Each</li>
<li class="p1">Pound</li>
<li class="p1">Gram</li>
<li class="p1">Crate</li>
<li class="p1">Box</li>
<li class="p1">24 Count</li>
<li class="p1">12 Count</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">By establishing which units of measure you use and creating standardized abbreviations for them (for example; ea. instead of EA, Ea, EA(s)), you can organize your count process because you know what each quantity stands for.</p>
<h2 class="p4">UPC / EAN Barcode</h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/barcode-485220_960_720.png"><img class="wp-image-20149 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/barcode-485220_960_720.png" alt="barcode-485220_960_720" width="650" height="647" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/barcode-485220_960_720.png 723w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/barcode-485220_960_720-300x299.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/barcode-485220_960_720-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Any retail item needs a UPC or Universal Product Code. If you purchase mass-market products instead of manufacturing your own, they should automatically feature both a UPC and EAN Barcode.</p>
<p class="p1">UPC and EAN are almost always used in combination with each other, and can be used to introduce technology like barcode scanning to speed up inventory counts.  If you manufacture your own product, you will have to purchase UPC and EAN codes to use them.</p>
<p class="p1">UPC is valuable because it refers to a specific unit but not necessarily the smallest unit of sale. So, a UPC can include a box of 24 individual units, allowing you to scan in a crate or a box rather than having to scan individual items. This can speed up inventory count a great deal when managing bulk purchases.</p>
<h2 class="p4">ISSN/ISBN/ISMN</h2>
<p class="p1">If you are selling books, magazines, journals, or music, you have to use ISSN, ISBN, or ISMN (International Standard Serial Number, International Standard Book Number, and International Standard Music Number). These numbers function almost the same as UPC/EAN but are assigned by the publisher using a unique publisher code.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Amazon ASIN</h2>
<p class="p1">If you sell on Amazon, you must use Amazon&#8217;s ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number), but you can use it in tandem with your own SKU.</p>
<p class="p1">In most cases, the best inventory naming policy is to integrate the primary universal number (ISBN, UPC, etc.) with your own internal SKU system. Combining these systems allows you to use electronic tracking to easily scan barcodes during counts to improve accuracy, while using your own system for organization and search. This gives you maximum control over your system, while allowing for the most efficient electronic counts.</p>
<h1 class="p2">How to Ensure Accuracy</h1>
<p class="p1">Improving the accuracy of your physical inventory count means taking charge of your inventory process so that you can control when and how items are counted.</p>
<p class="p1">The first step should be to track moving inventory, so that you know where every item in your inventory is at all times.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, many inventory systems add inventory in transit from the manufacturer but fail to note the location of the inventory, which can cause inaccurate inventory counts.</p>
<p class="p1">Integrating location labeling and ensuring that your inventory management system integrates with your supplier or manufacturer will solve this problem.</p>
<p class="p1">You can also integrate barcode scanning to scan every item in and out of your warehouse to track incoming and outgoing inventory, and automatically move it to a new location.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Cycle Counting</h2>
<p class="p1">You need regular physical counts to ensure the accuracy of your digital inventory. The more secluded your warehouse and the fewer employees you have, the less necessary this becomes, but you should physically count all your stock at least once per year no matter what.</p>
<p class="p1">Stock is often lost, broken, damaged, or misrepresented in your inventory system. A physical count will give you a better idea of what you have, so that you can update your system to match.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use item count for large items.</strong> UPC and EAN barcode scanning speeds up this process and reduces human error.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use rough calculations for items that are too small to warrant item counting.</strong> Use weight or volume measurements to calculate rough estimates of how many small items (like plastic bags or packages of small toys) you have so you can save costs.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use valuation to prioritize your top selling inventory.</strong> Track your sales so that you understand which products make you the most money, and prioritize them in your count. If you sell 100+ of one item and less than 5 of another per month, it&#8217;s more important to count the 100+ item multiple times per year.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Consider completing a cycle count of top-selling stock at least once per quarter.</strong></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Consider creating stock sheets</strong> and having receivers counter sign them for accuracy and auditing purposes if you have a large warehouse.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">Inventory auditing</h2>
<p class="p1">Human error is one of the primary causes of inventory count issues. For this reason, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-warehousing/">a strong inventory audit process</a> should be part of your inventory count. By auditing your count as part of the process, you can strategically check every count as part of your process.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use a control officer</strong> to begin checking inventory counts against expected numbers as soon as the count begins. If you wait until the count is over, you&#8217;ll have to do a recount to audit.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Ensure that the count is performed by someone familiar with the products</strong>. If you&#8217;re counting boxes, it&#8217;s easier to count if you know what is in the box and how many.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Create an organized count process</strong>. Start with top selling products, count in alphabetical order, or count based on location, but use a process to ensure that everything is counted.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>The auditor should inspect the inventory during the count.</strong></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>The auditor should observe the stock counting procedure</strong> to make sure that it is adequate.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="p2">How to Make It All So Much Easier</h1>
<p class="p1">The easiest way to improve your inventory counts is to make your system easy to use. By taking steps to create better organization, reduce stock, and define areas of importance, you can make cycle counts faster and more accurate.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Reduce Your Stock</h2>
<p class="p1">While it&#8217;s not right for every ecommerce store, stock reduction using a JIT (Just in Time) or other inventory management system can greatly reduce the volume of stock you have to count. This will improve accuracy, because you will have fewer items to count.</p>
<p class="p1">JIT inventory management relies on understanding how much you sell and when, so that you can stock just enough to order again Just in Time to prevent a stock out.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Inventory Locations</h2>
<p class="p1">Clearly defining inventory locations as part of your system is crucial to inventory accuracy. While many leave this out of their inventory management system, a defined location allows you to easily see if the stock should be at your warehouse, in transit, with a third-party logistics company, or in manufacturing, so that you can account for it even if it isn&#8217;t in your warehouse.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Automate</h2>
<p class="p1">Automate alerts or re-orders when stock reaches certain levels to avoid overstocking. This can save you money on storage, but will also reduce the burden on cycle counts by ensuring that you never have too much of an item.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Cross-Channel Inventory</h2>
<p class="p1">While a reliable number relies on a physical count, you also have to know what your actual inventory should be.</p>
<p class="p1">If you&#8217;re selling through multiple sales channels like Amazon and eBay plus your own site, you’ll need cross-channel inventory management to avoid mistakes. A <a href="https://www.skubana.com/">cross-channel inventory management system</a> will allow you to sync your inventory in real time, so that you know your sales and total inventory across all channels.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/modern-inventory-management/">Consolidating your multi-channel inventory</a> makes physical counts easier, gives you more foresight when it comes to planning, and helps prevent problems.</p>
<h1 class="p2">Establish Standards</h1>
<p class="p1">Creating an internal policy of organization and counting will help to ensure that you keep track of your stock over the long-term. Using EAN barcodes to scan items in and out of warehouses, ensuring that deliveries and delivery counts are verified manually, and using an auditing system to prevent loss or theft can greatly improve your internal organization.</p>
<p class="p1">Great inventory management will reduce your costs by helping you to avoid overstocking or selling out, and enhance customer service by offering faster fulfilment. Create a brand policy of regular inventory cycle counts, develop strong internal organization, and use the right technology.</p>

<p class="p1">My co-founder, Maxim Godin, and I launched our first ecommerce business back in 2008 –– on eBay.</p>
<p class="p1">In the past 8 years, from our first attempt at ecommerce to <a href="https://camerakings.co.uk/">CameraKings.co.uk</a>, we&#8217;ve seen it all. We have taken our business from suspended accounts to more than $100,000 in monthly sales, winning eBay awards for the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization/">highest conversion rates</a> on the platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Our success on eBay wasn’t overnight. It never is. Success is for the stubborn and persistent. Those who will not take ‘No’ for an answer.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We have taken our business from suspended accounts to more than $100,000 in monthly sales, winning eBay awards for the highest conversion rates.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">I think of our early days on eBay as a youth stage. We were in our nascent days, learning to walk and talk. It was in our teenage years –– so to speak –– that we got suspended for copyright infringement. We used stock images found on Google, which we quickly learned is a big no-no.</p>
<p class="p1">In those days, we were always moving two steps ahead only to take one back. It seemed we had to learn everything the hard way. It felt like natural selection. I saw businesses launch and grow relatively successful on eBay only to fall out of favor with buyers and lose it all. Some would never even get their feet under them.</p>
<p class="p1">We survived the early lessons –– and live to tell the tale to help others more quickly and readily succeed.</p>
<p class="p1">Soon, we were making real money on eBay, leading us to launch our second sales channel –– the aforementioned webstore CameraKings.co.uk, catering to filmmakers&#8217; needs.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-18393 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof-1.png" alt="CameraKings Team Award" width="566" height="311" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof-1.png 566w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof-1-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Maxim Godin and Victor Levitin, eBay award for highest conversion rates.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Since then, we’ve made a strategic decision to focus on growing our webstore.</p>
<p class="p1">eBay, however, is a major pillar of our selling success –– and is the entire reason I am a successful entrepreneur to begin with.</p>
<p class="p1">What’s more is that I will never give up my eBay sales channel. Not because I’m a loyalist, but because I’ve seen how eBay can save a business from death.</p>
<p class="p1">My company’s own horror story proves why the eBay marketplace is a saving grace.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The Unpredictability of Google Algorithms</h2>
<p class="p1">In 2012, our eBay business accounted for less than 30% of the business, with most revenue already being generated from our webstore.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, Google released the Panda and Penguin algorithm updates.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>We lost more than 60% of our webstore traffic almost overnight.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-18392 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof.png" alt="Google algorithm update" width="665" height="191" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof.png 665w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof-300x86.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /></p>
<p class="p1">If it wasn&#8217;t for our eBay store, our entire business would have been dead in the water and I would have no further journey to share from this point. We would have gone bankrupt like thousands of businesses did in 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p class="p1">Don&#8217;t get me wrong: I&#8217;m not saying eBay is a safe harbor. In fact, eBay itself was<a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-ebay-penalty-cost-197031"> hit hard by Google&#8217;s algorithm change</a> back in 2014 too.</p>
<p class="p1">An eBay business isn&#8217;t different from any other business. Don&#8217;t believe those self-proclaimed eBay experts who will teach you how to make a million dollars on eBay for a $500 course.</p>
<p class="p1">I did more than a million dollars in revenue on eBay, and let me tell you the secret: it&#8217;s the polar opposite of relaxing on the beach with your laptop as promised by the get-rich-quick crowd.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Diversifying your risk is critical in the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">ever-changing world of ecommerce</a>. Without eBay, our business would have died years ago.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">It takes a lot of heart, sweat and tears to build a successful business. And an eBay business is no different.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>With that said, without eBay, our business would have died years ago.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s kind of funny if you think about it: we launched our webstore to diversify our risk. We took a &#8220;Don&#8217;t put all your eggs in one basket” approach. We didn’t want our business to completely rely on eBay.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, fate kicked in.</p>
<p class="p1">It was eventually eBay that saved our company when things went south.</p>
<p class="p1">Diversifying your risk is critical in the ever changing world of ecommerce. That isn’t the only reason why I believe every webstore owner should sell on eBay.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Why Every Webstore Owner Should Sell on eBay</h2>
<h3 class="p5">Turnkey traffic and business stream</h3>
<p class="p1">This is what we pay eBay for. We list a product today; we get customers tomorrow.</p>
<p class="p1">We don&#8217;t need to worry about promotion, discovery and traffic. That is what eBay does best.</p>
<p class="p1">eBay has 165 million buyers worldwide. By listing on eBay, we instantly tap into this high-volume, highly relevant traffic source of potential customers.</p>
<p class="p1">eBay earns a fee per sale. It&#8217;s in their best interest to generate high quality leads that convert to orders. For that reason, the new eBay management team is heavily investing in SEO, TV advertising and attracting new generations of customers to the marketplace.</p>
<p class="p1">With our webstore, it took half a year just to get it off the ground. We paid $3,000 a month <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-choose-an-ecommerce-seo-agency-what-to-ask/">to top SEO agencies</a> hoping they could deliver.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, when we finally got some steady traffic, Google updated their algorithm and we were back to square one.</p>
<p class="p1">With eBay, the stream of traffic and orders is almost immediate.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Drive More Traffic</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Learn how you can drive more traffic to your store with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-drive-traffic-convert-customers/">30 actionable tactics to put in place today</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p5">Using eBay as a tool to build your brand</h3>
<p class="p1">One of the unique things about doing business on eBay versus other marketplaces is that they enable you to market your store and your business in much the same way you would your own webstore. We’ve taken advantage of this over the years by applying some simple marketing tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Consistent design and experience</strong> on the webstore and eBay, in line with the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">omni-channel trend across retail</a>. This way, customers who visit our eBay listings remember our brand colors, logos, layout and feel confident shopping when finding CameraKings.co.uk on Google. Note: Some companies prefer to sell on eBay under a different brand for reasons such as supplier agreements and MSRP.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Promoted our brand via eBay customer support</strong>. Signing every message with &#8220;Oliver G., CameraKings Customer Support&#8221; will resonate with your audience by personalizing your communication. Folks will search Google for you if they&#8217;re happy with their eBay transaction.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Replied to all feedback on eBay</strong>, mentioning our brand for the same reason as above.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Start Selling on eBay Now</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Ready to get started on eBay and increase your sales? Use BigCommerce&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ebay">Channel Manager and eBay integration now</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p5">Some customers will never buy off eBay</h3>
<p class="p1">eBay takes responsibility for transactions on the marketplace, and has a well-developed trust infrastructure. For 20 years, eBay has worked to build trust between buyers and sellers and remediate issues through programs like Money-Back Guarantee and eBay Buyer-Protection.</p>
<p class="p1">Consumers simply trust eBay and know that, in any case of problem, they are covered.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-18395 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof-3.png" alt="eBay Buyer Protection" width="461" height="159" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof-3.png 461w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof-3-300x103.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></p>
<p class="p1">For this reason, there is a significant segment of eBay shoppers who won&#8217;t look elsewhere. These shoppers have learned to trust eBay. They only feel confident doing their online shopping on this marketplace.</p>
<p class="p1">If you don&#8217;t sell on eBay, you miss these customers entirely.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>The Importance of Trust</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Learn all about the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/marketing-psychology/">science of emotional buying</a> and what you can do about it.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p5">eBay is leading the mobile shopping age</h3>
<p class="p1">With mobile commerce projected to see an 18% increase by 2020, it’s important for any brand to partner with a mobile-friendly marketplace.</p>
<p class="p1">With nearly 340 million downloads, eBay&#8217;s mobile app is a leading mobile shopping app. In Q3 2016, eBay recently reported more than<a href="https://static.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/PressRoom/eBay-Q3-2016-Fact-Sheet-Investor-Relations.pdf"> 58% of transactions on the marketplace are already being influenced by mobile</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-18394 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof-2.png" alt="eBay mobile commerce" width="591" height="344" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof-2.png 591w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-future-proof-2-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></p>
<p class="p1">For millions of shoppers, eBay&#8217;s mobile app is the first destination for learning about the category of their desired item, understanding the important parameters and discovering the available buying options.</p>
<p class="p1">By listing on eBay, you increase your brand’s exposure, and the chance for mobile shoppers to find and choose you.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>The Mobile Future</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Mobile friendliness is as important on your own website as it is on marketplaces. Checkout BigCommerce&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">67 responsive themes</a> and update your mobile UX today.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">How can you apply this to your business?</h2>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>You should look at selling on eBay as a strategy to grow and promote your brand and webstore with immediate results.</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">I call eBay the sandbox for ecommerce businesses. With the almost instant flow of traffic and orders, it&#8217;s a great way to get started. As our business matured, we&#8217;ve also found that it&#8217;s the perfect place to test out new product offerings, expand into international markets through programs like their <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/faq/global-shipping.html#gsc.tab=0">Global Shipping Program</a> and get in front of customers searching on mobile devices.</p>
<p class="p1">The real challenge is in continuing to build your own brand and webstore. In our case, eBay played a major role in our success and continues to as we <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/announcing-bigcommerce-ebay-integration/">sell on eBay through BigCommerce</a>. It can do the same for you.</p>
<p class="p1">Happy selling!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Amazon Product Sourcing: Where Do Your Competitors Get Their Products?</h2>
<p class="p1">As you research potential manufacturing partners for your private label business, you can access public import records to see from where your competitors are sourcing their products. Think of this as a shortcut to identifying overseas manufacturing capabilities similar to what you need.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Just because your competitors are using specific overseas manufacturers doesn&#8217;t mean you will be able to get cooperation from the manufacturers to make your products. Keep in mind; these manufacturers may not be able to accommodate your custom design needs. It is a good place to start, however, without having to make a whirlwind trip overseas to identify suitable manufacturers.</p>
<p class="p1"><table id="table_15934823" width="100%" class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Company</th><th>Channel Served</th><th>Phone</th><th>Contact</th></tr>

<h2 class="p1">Amazon Price Tracker</h2>
<p class="p1">Realistically, you should install these free tools immediately upon becoming an Amazon seller. By being able to determine listing activity across other sellers on listings you currently have or are considering adding to your catalog, you can gauge likely types of pricing competition you will face. You will also be able to understand whether the product has been sold by Amazon itself.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Remember, it&#8217;s critical to look at historical pricing information so you aren&#8217;t getting a static and potentially misleading picture of competition. For example, you may see the product you&#8217;re aspiring to sell has very little competition only to discover a week later that Amazon itself is selling this product. It was only temporarily out of stock, at which point you will be back to competing head-to-head with Amazon. This is something that may cause you to rethink whether you want to sell that item.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Inventory Scouter</h2>
<p class="p3">If part of your sourcing model includes retail arbitrage, you can save yourself a lot of time by having one of these tools accessible when you walk the aisles of your retail sources. By scanning barcodes to produce instantaneous Amazon product and profitability information, you can quickly establish whether an item makes sense to buy for resale on Amazon.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Most of these tools look only at Amazon fees and your cost of goods sold. You should factor in any indirect and overhead costs  into your decision on whether to buy any of these items for resale. In doing so, you may find that some of the estimated profitable items you&#8217;ve scanned aren&#8217;t profitable and that your time wandering the aisles inspecting product isn&#8217;t, in fact, free. There is real opportunity cost to your time.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Amazon Product Research</h2>
<p class="p3">When you go looking for new products to add to your Amazon catalog, you may find yourself scouring through supplier catalogs or staring at spec sheets. <em>Just how are you making your decisions about what to add?</em></p>
<p class="p3">Are you able to screen hundreds and thousands of prospective products on criteria like Amazon customer demand, Amazon seller competition, the presence of Amazon Retail as one of the competing sellers, margin opportunity, and so on? Without some automated tools, you likely aren’t able to do a deep-dive on most prospective products.</p>
<p class="p3">Fortunately, these product research tools can help accelerate this evaluation process significantly, allowing you to become more efficient and data-driven in your sourcing decisions.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p3">While the line between inventory scouter software and product research software is closing every day, I typically see more types of data in the product research software. But, you have to figure out how to incorporate these additional data points into your decision on whether to source specific items.</p>
<p class="p3">Also, keep in mind that product attractiveness can change very quickly by the introduction of a just one lower-cost competitor, so make a habit of revisiting this information on a regular basis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Amazon Inventory &amp; Order Management Solutions</h2>
<p class="p1">If you are a multi-channel seller, keeping track of your overall inventory levels can get tricky. If you oversell inventory, you upset customers and are on the fast track to getting your Amazon account suspended. And if you undersell, you have lost out on sales. You need to have real-time inventory numbers to manage inventory by channel, giving you the ability to replenish FBA quickly (if required) or place new product orders with your suppliers if you are running out on critical selection.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">There is quite a bit of variation across inventory and order management companies. Some charge a percentage of sales, while others charge by the number of orders processed. Some incorporate sophisticated analytics and purchase order management tools, while others incorporate some listing functionality, repricers, accounting software integration and shipping rate optimization tools. Also, not all marketplaces can be handled by each inventory and order management tool today. Careful due diligence on such centrally critical software is necessary for the individual business owner.</p>
<p class="p1">Ask each company:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What&#8217;s included and what&#8217;s not?</li>
<li class="p1">How much automation of which steps can the software do?</li>
<li class="p1">How much flexibility do you have to roll into or out of the software? How long is the on-boarding process, and what &#8220;house-in-order&#8221; steps are required of you to get started?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="p3">Amazon Third-Party Logistics (3PL) Solutions</h2>
<p class="p1">Do you pride yourself on moving into bigger warehouses every couple of years, all because your business keeps growing? Are you spending more and more of your time managing your warehouse (staff, equipment, operations), rather than building your business? You probably didn&#8217;t become an entrepreneur to become an expert on the intricacies of managing a warehouse.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">While competitively-priced 3PLs can be more expensive than the out-of-pocket costs of running your own warehouse, your most precious asset is your time to spend on building your business. Be prepared to spend a little more on warehousing through a 3PL in order to free yourself up from all of the headaches a warehouse often brings a small business owner.</p>
<p class="p1">Not all 3PLs are equally experienced at FBA prep, poly bagging, bundling and kitting. Do your research carefully, and talk with case study clients that the 3PL provides. Also, expect some transition period up front as you train the 3PL employees on exactly the process you want for your order processing.</p>
