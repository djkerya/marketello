The orders are rolling in and your business is primed for explosive growth.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s it, right?</p>
<p class="p1">Not so fast. While product-market fit and user acquisition are undoubtedly crucial to your business, ecommerce fulfillment is the engine that keeps your car running.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s start from the beginning.</p>
<h2 class="p3">What is order fulfillment?</h2>
<p class="p1">Fulfillment encompasses the entire process of receiving an order and delivering it to a customer. As anyone well-versed in operational ecommerce is aware, this actually encompasses a number of complex steps throughout the supply chain that all play a significant role in how customers perceive your business.</p>
<p class="p1">To name only a few of the steps, proper fulfillment requires:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Warehouse organization</li>
<li class="p1">Order management</li>
<li class="p1">Packaging</li>
<li class="p1">Shipping</li>
<li class="p1">Customer communication</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">But you may not have to do some — or all — of those processes in-house.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are a medium-sized or growing business, it’s likely that you have begun to investigate <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/fulfillment-delivery/">order fulfillment services</a>, and might have experimented with one already. While small businesses can often <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/inventory-management-software/">manage their inventory</a>, packing, and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">shipping</a>, as the operation scales up, additional support is needed and beneficial.</p>
<p class="p1">Product fulfillment is the most important artery supporting the overall health of a quickly growing ecommerce business. Understanding what options are out there, how they can help, and which is best for your business is a critical decision-making process.</p>
<p class="p1">In this guide, we’ll walk through everything you need to know about three of the most popular strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Drop-shipping</li>
<li class="p1">Third-party ecommerce fulfillment</li>
<li class="p1">Self-fulfillment</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">And we’ll look specifically at the following in regards to each of your options:</p>

<li class="p1">When it’s time to establish your own product fulfilment and distribution center</li>
<li class="p1">Next steps for your business right now</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The ultimate goal with this guide is that you understand what each fulfillment technique is, when to use it, how it works, and how to get started. You can then select the right solution to take your company to the next level and ultimately sell more. Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Defining Order Fulfillment Terms</h2>
<p class="p1">Let’s take a look at how the order fulfillment process works in three common models.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Dropshipping</h3>
<p class="p1">With dropshipping, inventory is not owned before the sale is made.</p>
<p class="p1">The seller is a middleman, often never actually seeing or “possessing” the product, but rather focusing on marketing it to customers and making sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Once goods are sold, the seller has them shipped directly to the customer from a dedicated dropshipper, or the manufacturer.</p>
<p class="p1">Stores that drop ship deal exclusively with marketing and branding, but outsource the logistics of ecommerce, i.e. the fulfillment.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/order-fulfillment.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21298" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/order-fulfillment.png" alt="" width="641" height="514" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/order-fulfillment.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/order-fulfillment-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">There are a variety of dropshipping types –– and in all of which you, the seller, remain the middleman.</p>
<p class="p1">Say you sell furniture that you market through both your website and a brick-and-mortar showroom. With the dropshipping model, every time a customer places an order, you would then place an order with your source.</p>
<p class="p1">By doing so, you keep nothing on hand and your profit is made from the difference between your retail price and the price you pay your source for each product (along with any other associated costs).</p>
<p class="p1">Here is your profit calculation for this model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Profit = Retail Price &#8211; Price Per Product Bought from Dropshipper</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="p1">The dropshipping benefit:</h4>
<p class="p1">It isn’t just startups using dropshipping. Brands like Macy’s and Lord &amp; Taylor use dropshipping from their suppliers to alleviate risk (i.e. the risk of buying too much of a product that just won’t sell).</p>
<p class="p1">Dropshipping helps both startups and larger organizations understand what the market wants before committing fully to creating a custom item, or buying in bulk.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Third-Party Fulfillment</h3>
<p class="p1">With <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-is-a-3pl-third-party-logistics-and-ecommerce">third-party fulfillment</a>, inventory is owned before the sale is made. The seller often purchases or manufactures the product, stores the inventory with the third-party company, and then markets the product in order to sell it.</p>
<p class="p1">When an order is processed, the third party (NOT the online store) packages the order and ships it to the customer. Third parties also usually help with COGS and economies of scale.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21297" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment.png" alt="" width="640" height="432" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment.png 640w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Let’s continue with the same example of a furniture business. With third-party <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/ecommerce-fulfillment/">ecommerce fulfillment</a>, you may still have a website and showroom for marketing, but when a customer places an order, you already have the inventory.</p>
<p class="p1">Your third-party logistics provider (3PL) is contacted (this can be automated on your ecommerce platform), and they package the product and ship it to the customer. Your profit will be the remaining difference between the retail price, the price you pay per product, and the fees you pay your third-party provider.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is what that looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Profit = Retail Price &#8211; Price Per Product &#8211; 3PL fees</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="p1">The 3PL benefit:</h4>
<p class="p1">Using a 3PL to outsource picking, packing and shipping frees up your time to focus on marketing, finding net new customers, nurturing repeat customers and more.</p>
<p class="p1">Brands of all sizes use 3PLs, and most 3PLs integrate directly with ecommerce platform like BigCommerce, so once someone places an order, the system alerts the 3PL to pick, pack and ship –– no manual work on your end needing to be done.</p>
<p class="p1">3PLs are best for brands which have their own, unique product (in dropshipping, you are using a supplier’s product), no inventory space and want to focus on acquisition rather than shipping.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Self-Fulfillment &amp; Shipping</h3>
<p class="p1">With self-fulfillment (or “direct fulfillment”), you own the inventory and fulfill orders yourself — no outside party involved.</p>
<p class="p1">Often, a warehouse is leased where pickers and packers handle the orders and a WMS (Warehouse Management Software) is purchased as well. The warehouse usually acts as the distribution center, or “hub” for all of your fulfillment.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/supply-chain.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21296" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/supply-chain.png" alt="" width="641" height="384" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/supply-chain.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/supply-chain-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In our same furniture business example, you have your own warehouse space for storing inventory and handle fulfilling the orders in-house. You might even use your own workforce to pack and ship items.</p>
<p class="p1">In the self-fulfillment model, profit is the difference between your retail price and the costs associated with buying inventory, storing it, and fulfilling orders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Profit= Retail Price &#8211; Inventory Buying &#8211; Inventory Storing &#8211; Fulfillment costs</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="p1">The self-fulfillment benefit:</h4>
<p class="p1">With self-fulfillment, you are in control. For startups, choosing self-fulfillment may save you money (though certainly will cost you in time) as you pick, pack and ship items yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">For larger organizations, self-fulfillment gives you control over exactly how your items are picked and packed, and when they are shipped to meet customer expectations.</p>
<p class="p1">Brands choosing self-fulfillment are often particular about the delivery experience, which means more control during packing is required.</p>
<h2 class="p7">Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Each Fulfillment Technique</h2>
<h3 class="p3">Drop-Shipping</h3>
<p class="p1">Although a drop-shipping model creates an easy and inexpensive way to add products to your online store, those same low barriers to entry are a double-edged sword.</p>
<p class="p1">This can be a great way to get going, and for efficient operations, can even sustain growth. Understanding the pros and cons before you start is crucial to drop-shipping success.</p>
<h4 class="p4">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Easy to start:</strong> Drop-shippers provide the products and the shipping, so all you need to do is focus on sales.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Minimal business development:</strong> You’re leveraging the network of your drop-shipper, instead of personally building the relationships with every supplier. Essentially, every new partner allows you to grow by a significantly large number of new products.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>More products, faster:</strong> Growth in ecommerce begins with adding more products to your website. Integrating a drop-shipper’s products with your business is simple and straightforward because all you’re doing is supporting the links and learning the prices—not lining up any other part of the logistics.This allows more people to discover you and increases the number of touchpoints by which interested shoppers can encounter your brand.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Affordable:</strong> Low overhead makes drop shipping a great starting place for online retailers. All you do is pay for inventory when a sale is made, so you avoid operational expenses like warehousing. Profitability is not guaranteed, though, which we’ll get to in the next section.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Test before committing:</strong> Since you don’t incur overhead, you can test out the viability of new markets for existing products anywhere you can establish a drop-shipper service.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Focus on what you do well:</strong> The convenience of a hands-off product fulfillment experience thereby enables businesses to focus on other priorities, which is especially advantageous to new companies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p4">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>No customization:</strong> Drop shipping usually means virtually no support for custom products. To achieve this type of support and customization, your dropshipper would have to function as a warehouse.  Unfortunately, this is not likely unless their margins on custom products were worth the time and effort — in which case, the margins would likely not make sense for you.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Lower quality control:</strong> Since the seller is removed from the fulfillment process, you’re entrusting your brand’s reputation to another party — while maintaining accountability. Buyers usually don’t think about fulfillment models or drop shippers. If a defective product arrives or there is a miscommunication about the shipment, your customer doesn’t want to hear that it was out of your control; all they care about is the overall experience.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Reduced brand power: </strong>Your products are produced by others, so it’s more difficult to establish a unique brand. The reduced quality control only increases the risk to your brand.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Competitive (dis)advantage:</strong> Low barriers to entry mean it’s hard to establish a competitive advantage over other businesses. You’re competing on price, and that can easily become a losing game.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Scale:</strong> Logistics can become challenging as a business scales up, especially when coordinating with multiple drop-shippers.</li>

</ul>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p3">Third-Party Ecommerce Fulfillment</h3>
<p class="p1">Third party fulfillment can provide you with a national or even global footprint of warehouses, allowing you to reach out customers faster while taking advantage of shipping discounts.</p>
<p class="p1">However, picking, packing, and storage fees can cut into your profit margin, particularly for slim-margin stores.</p>
<h4 class="p4">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Inventory can be purchased in bulk</strong> in order to improve profit margins.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>No investment is required</strong> for warehouse space/real estate, WMS software, or a workforce to pick and pack orders.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>There is an added convenience of outsourcing</strong> the process to a trusted professional.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Shipping discounts</strong> can be much better than if you were to negotiate on your own.
<ul>
<li class="p1">I.e: Your business ships 5,000 packages per month, but the third-party ecommerce fulfillment company may be handling 150,000 orders per month. They’re going to be able to get better shipping rates with FedEx/UPS than you can alone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p4">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Quality can be compromised.
<ul>
<li class="p1">You have to do your due diligence: a third-party ecommerce fulfillment company controls your ecommerce business’s final handoff of value to your customers. In other words, they have the opportunity to make or break your customer satisfaction levels, which affects the lifetime value of these customers on your business.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p3">Self-Fulfillment</h3>
<p class="p1">Self-fulfillment, when done correctly, can add a huge competitive advantage to you store.</p>
<p class="p1">The problem is it can be extremely capital intensive, and one needs to think carefully about the location of their warehouse, as well as the time it will take to operate your own logistical process on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<h4 class="p4">Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>It offers 100% control</strong> of inventory and the pick, pack, and ship process.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>It can be low-cost</strong> when the business is small because you are just paying for shipping (and doing the work yourself).</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Anyone can do it.</strong> You don’t need any contacts (as long as you have space to store products, address labels, and packing resources such as packing slips).</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>For businesses shipping significant volume</strong>, negotiated shipping rates through FedEx, UPS, and/or USPS can become a competitive advantage.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p4">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1">It is time-consuming. Packing all of the products yourself will take time. As orders increase, this can take up most of your day.</li>
<li class="p1">It is costly as the business grows and can be very burdensome for a young business. You need the following:
<ul>
<li class="p1">Warehouse space</li>
<li class="p1">Warehouse equipment</li>
<li class="p1">Additional staff</li>
<li class="p1">Order fulfillment software requirements</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">With these pros and cons in mind, let’s look more closely at how each technique works, situations where each is most beneficial, and tips on getting started.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p7">When Does a Drop-Shipping Model Make Sense?</h2>
<p class="p1">Being that drop-shipping has a low price of entry and therefore presents a limited amount of risk, it can be a good solution for a lean startup looking to break into a market, or for an established business that wants to test out a new market.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s dig into how this technique can be utilized for companies of your size.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Drop-Shipping for Startups</h3>
<p class="p1">Let’s say you’re a travel blogger with tens of thousands of followers. A lot of your followers want to get your “swag,” such as hats, t-shirts, and the new travel bag that you designed.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re not sure if you want to invest a ton of time and money into a new ecommerce business, but you find an on-demand tee-shirt printer and hat embroiderer who will drop-ship orders for you.</p>
<p class="p1">By utilizing them, you can start processing orders and have the drop-shipper print and embroider your products as the orders come in. If orders really take off, great, then you know the idea will work and you can look into ordering your shirts, hats, and whatever new products you want to buy in bulk.</p>
<p class="p1">If they don’t take off, then you’re not in a bad position because you haven’t built up an inventory.</p>
<p class="p1">Drop-shipping allows you a chance to break into a market, establish your brand, and generate a small amount of income that you can use to fuel bulk purchase orders and eventually increase your profit margins.</p>
<p class="p1">It can be a smart tactic for startups, but you should note that this isn’t the same path you’d take if you were an existing company looking to try out a new market.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Use Printful for Custom Swag Drop-Shipping</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/printful-dropship-t-shirts-posters-leggings-and-more-print-products/">Create and drop ship custom items on demand.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p3">Drop-Shipping for Existing Companies</h3>
<p class="p1">Let’s say you run an ecommerce store selling high-quality children’s toys. You’re great at what you do and have earned a very loyal following with your customer base.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, you have a wonderful relationship with your third-party fulfillment provider, which handles all your inventory coming in from suppliers overseas, as well as a few boutique suppliers in the U.S.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21295" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-1.png" alt="" width="641" height="193" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-1.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-1-300x90.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You decide that you want to explore other channels that the company can enter with new products. Given the strong customer base your business already has, you decide to test out sales for quality child strollers.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21294" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-2.png" alt="" width="208" height="193" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">At this point, you could look for a mass supplier for strollers, invest in an initial bulk order, and begin marketing them to test customer interest. However, you are then at risk of losing your investment if the products don’t sell, or at a minimum, tying up cash in a bunch of inventory that sells very slowly.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, you could use the “bullets before cannonballs” approach, where you test the waters before going in full-force.</p>
<p class="p1">Do this by hiring a drop-shipper and beginning to market the new product lines to test customer interest before investing in the products.</p>

<p class="p1">This strategy effectively removes the risk, allowing your established business to remain agile while testing a new market.</p>
<p class="p1">Sure, your profit margins may be lower on a per-unit basis, but partnering with a drop-shipper allows you to instantly launch a new product on your online store and test your assumptions before making a big cash investment.</p>
<p class="p1">Lando Landis, founder of <a href="https://www.rockerrags.com/search.php?search_query=luggage">RockerRags</a>, sells apparel for those seeking a rock-and-roll lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1">Most of his apparel sells for less than $30, but customers were still eager to purchase versions of the classic <a href="https://www.rockerrags.com/search.php?search_query=luggage">Pan Am luggage sets</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-21292 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-pan-am.png" alt="" width="500" height="402" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-pan-am.png 500w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-pan-am-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Rather than tie up several thousand dollars in the Pan Am inventory, Lando established a drop-shipping relationship with the manufacturer to handle the order fulfillment for the Pan Am merchandise.</p>
<p class="p2"> As Lando explained,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“This ended up being a great move because demand for the Pan Am product line tends to be pretty cyclical. Around the holidays it spikes, and sometimes in the spring. Because of the drop-shipper, I don’t have to worry about allocating cash to buy inventory up front but I still get the advantages of offering the products for sale online.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="p3">How to Land Your Drop-Shipping Partnership</h3>
<p class="p1">Dave Hermansen, who operates <a href="https://storecoach.com/">StoreCoach</a>, helps businesses and entrepreneurs establish and operate their online stores.</p>
<p class="p1">Dave operates nearly 60 independent stores of his own, 80% of which utilize drop-shipping fulfillment to some extent.</p>
<p class="p10"><img class="wp-image-21291 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-5.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-5.png 1439w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-5-300x157.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-5-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Dave has the following tips:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Find the top ranking specialty store for the product you want to drop-ship</strong>: Do research on the Google search volume for these products and the top selling brands, to better understand what opportunity exists if you were to acquire a small % of total search volume and sales.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Go to the root</strong>: Use Google to find the manufacturer for the product/brand. Most of the time the brand and the manufacturing company use the same name, (think Sony products and Sony manufacturing) but other times things may be less obvious. A simple (or advanced) Google search is the best place to start. You want to find the company who owns the manufacturing process of the products you want to sell, and then get the contact information for their sales team. Cross-referencing the manufacturer’s company name with Linkedin is an easy way to accomplish this.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Engage with the Sales Team, but leave out all mention of drop-shipping at first</strong>: The reality is manufacturers are bombarded with drop-shipping requests every week. Dave suggests intentionally leaving out all mention of drop-shipping at first. Instead, once you’ve developed a relationship with the sales rep, use a phrase like this:
<ul>
<li class="p1">“..we really want to add your brand to our store, but we want to see what products sells best for your product line… Do you mind if the manufacturer ships direct for the first 90 days, as we test out the new product line…?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Sometimes the manufacturer will refuse, if so, ask for the contact details for their 2-3 largest distributors</strong>: Then, use this information to repeat step 3.
<ul>
<li class="p1">Often times, dealing with a distributor can be more advantageous than dealing with the manufacturer because distributors likely deal with multiple brands, giving you an even wider opportunity to add products via a drop-shiping model to your store!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p4">A Drop-Shipping Drawback for Larger Brands</h3>
<p class="p1">There comes a point in the life of every business where customers take a risk on a new idea because of your brand. You’ve got a lot of existing, loyal customers who will hold anything new to your old standards of quality and care.</p>
<p class="p1">One concern with drop-shipping for established businesses is that you’re handing control of your products and customer service over to another company. This will limit your ability to brand an offer and may ultimately cut against your larger marketing efforts if your next product is an extension of an existing line.</p>
<p class="p1">Drop-shipping can cause this to get away from you because you’re sourcing and selling from multiple warehouses, which could cause inventory shortages. Plus, you’re no longer sticking to your branding; you’re selling something that any other company can partner with your drop-shipper to sell.</p>
<p class="p1">We often hear larger companies pitched about using drop-shipping when they want to expand and test a new market. It is cheaper than creating deals, but you ultimately are trading in name recognition for early, low-margin sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Every ecommerce brand knows that good reviews sell. If you look through your highest-rated reviews and find mentions not only of your products, but also your customer service teams and shipping times, drop-shipping may take away what your customers have come to appreciate and expect.</p>
<h2>3 Chief Drop-Ship Considerations</h2>
<p class="p1">So what can you expect when hiring a drop-shipper? Here are a few of the common practices.</p>
<h3 class="p4">1) Predefined Product Selection</h3>
<p class="p1">Each drop-shipper will give you a list of products that you can sell based on their manufacturing partners. Exclusive are sometimes available, but opportunities tend to be limited.</p>
<p class="p1">Drop-shippers should tell you the minimum price you can set for a product (when set by the manufacturer), which will allow you to make some revenue off of each sale.</p>
<h3 class="p4">2) Drop-Ship Fee</h3>
<p class="p1">There is a standard fee in the industry, which is typically charged on a per-item basis to cover the drop-shipper’s costs for packing and shipping an item. The amount typically ranges from $2 to $5, but can be higher, depending on the type of product.</p>
<p class="p1">Fees can be paid as soon as an order is placed, or within a certain time frame set out in your invoice terms.</p>
<h3 class="p4">3) Minimum Monthly Order</h3>
<p class="p1">Many drop-shippers require a minimum amount on your initial order to weed out the less serious customers. For example, you may encounter a $200 minimum order when your product only costs $50.</p>
<p class="p1">This is normal.</p>
<p class="p2">You can simply deposit the minimum amount, and it will be a credit in your account.</p>
<h2 class="p3">What to Look for in a Drop-Shipper</h2>
<p class="p1">When choosing a drop-shipper, here are a few tips to keep in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>If you know which product you want to sell</strong>, contact the manufacturer directly and ask for their wholesale distributors. Then, contact the distributors on the list and ask if they drop-ship.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Look for up-to-date technology such as a thorough online catalog</strong>, real-time inventory management, online searchable purchase history, and the like. These will help to enable a seamless experience for you and your customers.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Ask how they process orders</strong>. It’s very convenient to place orders by email. However, some providers are limited to taking orders over the phone or strictly through the website. Depending on your level of order automation, you’ll likely want to find a drop-shipper that can match or enhance your ordering process.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Good location is important</strong>. The distance your drop-shipper is from your customers will affect delivery time and their satisfaction levels.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Look for good customer support</strong>. It is best if you have your own customer service representative assigned to you and any issues you may have.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In summary, drop-shipping is a low-risk technique that is good for breaking into new markets. As you saw in both the examples, it can lead you to the place where it makes sense to invest in bulk purchasing. When that happens, third-party ecommerce fulfillment can help.</p>
<h2 class="p7">When to Partner with a Third-Party Fulfillment Company</h2>
<p class="p1">Understanding when and how to choose a fulfillment solution partner are critical steps to a successful online business.</p>
<p class="p10"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-6.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21290" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-6.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-6.png 1439w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-6-300x157.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-6-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Take the story of Craig Rabin, the inventor of <a href="https://theairhook.com/">The AirHook</a>, who was astonished when his innovative airline cup and electronics holder took off on KickStarter faster than a jet plane.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>His $15,000 goal was fully reached in 73 hours, and within 30 days, over $78,000 worth of orders had been placed!</strong></p>
<p class="p1">These are great problems to have, but problems nonetheless.</p>
<p class="p1">With so many orders placed, the question of how Craig was single-handedly going to fulfill over 4,000 orders to his eager customers became a primary concern.</p>
<p class="p1">With the daunting task of over 4,000 orders to be fulfilled, Craig partnered with a fulfillment specialist in the eastern part of the country to complement his location in Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p class="p1">Craig explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“the fulfillment company was a huge help with the massive number of orders placed on KickStarter, but once those orders were fulfilled, I realized that having only one product (in five different colors), along with smaller quantities of orders streaming in after the KickStarter campaign, it was fairly easy for me to handle most of the fulfillment on my own.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Now Craig leverages his fulfillment partner for other benefits, such as the discounted shipping rates for international shipments, or spikes in order volume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“My 3PL was able to provide significantly better international shipping rates, so they handle all non-domestic orders, and sometimes international orders if volume spikes,” Craig said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">While <a href="https://theairhook.com/">AirHook</a>’s surge in KickStarter orders is a great problem to be dealing with, it’s critical for growing and established brands to understand what core competencies are driving their business growth, and to ensure that your company is able to focus on those functions that will continue to “move the needle” for your online store</p>
<p class="p1">Having a dependable fulfillment partner, either a supplement to your drop shipping or self-fulfillment operations, or to handle your order fulfillment altogether, is a great way to ensure that your time is spent on those core competencies. Let’s take a closer look at when it’s a good idea to partner with a 3PL and the factors you should consider when choosing one.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">If you are a growing startup that’s finally hit enough buyers to outgrow storing and shipping products out of your mom’s basement (congrats!), it’s a good time to turn to a 3PL.</li>
<li class="p1">If you are an existing small- to mid-size established business (with online revenue in the high seven or low eight figures) and your distribution network is not a core competency, 3PL will also be helpful.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Choosing a 3PL means not having to deal with the major financial and logistical demands that come with fulfillment. Instead of investing in forklifts and other expensive, constantly depreciating equipment, you can focus on growing your marketing exposure.</p>
<p class="p1">You won’t need to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars annually on warehouse space, employees that present liability, and expensive software, but can instead focus on existing product design and testing.</p>
<p class="p1">A 3PL is a surefire way to loosen up cash flow back into more important functions that increase your revenue in the long run.</p>
<h2 class="p3">How Third-Party Fulfillment Providers Work</h2>
<p class="p1">Billing from one provider to the next may vary greatly, but they generally will include the following fulfillment operations and billing charges.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Fulfillment Operations</h3>
<p class="p1">The invoice that a 3PL sends you might list a dozen separate charges, but most of them tend to fall into one of three broad categories.</p>
<h4 class="p1">1. Receiving Fees</h4>
<p class="p1">Receiving fees cover the cost of (drumroll, please) receiving containers full of products that need to be properly inventoried. They can be assessed in a number of ways. You may be charged:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">An hourly labor fee to unload a container</li>
<li class="p1">A flat fee for the task</li>
<li class="p1">By the pallet, box, or even item</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you sell small items like iPhone cover cases, getting charged by the item (even if it’s something piddling like $0.25) might end up being much more expensive than simply paying a flat fee to unload a whole container full of them. You’ll have to do the math and factor in the volume you sell to determine which rate makes the most sense for you.</p>
<h3 class="p1">2. Storage</h3>
<p class="p1">The other major fee—and this can be a big one—is for storage. Some companies charge by the pallet, while others go by the cubic foot. It’s also good to know that prices can fluctuate throughout the year.</p>
<p class="p1">Amazon, for example, is known for charging more for storage in the peak holiday shopping season, between October and January; other 3PLs have followed this demand-based model and have higher prices for storing inventory when there’s less available space in warehouses.</p>
<h3 class="p1">3. Picking</h3>
<p class="p1">A lot of time goes into finding one particular product in a warehouse that may be the size of 10 football fields (or more), and it still needs to be shuttled over and packed after it’s found. That’s why a common fee charged by 3PL providers is for picking a product off the shelf and running it over to the packing station.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, the pricing model itself may vary.</p>
<p class="p1">While some companies may charge you a flat per-item fee, others might charge extra if an item is over a certain weight limit or is especially fragile, since heavier or delicate items require extra labor to ensure proper handling.</p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Packing</h3>
<p class="p1">Once the package has been removed from its shelf in inventory, it goes to the packing stage. Some 3PLs include packing as part of their picking services. Others charge additional fees for basic packing supplies like boxes and padding.</p>
<p class="p1">Make sure to ask about what sort of packaging your partner uses.</p>
<p class="p1">Envelopes weigh less and take up less space than cardboard boxes, but sacrifice security in the process. Some of your products might involve kitting, such as combining three SKUs into one box.</p>
<p class="p1">When that happens, a 3PL might charge you a small fee to cover the extra labor involved. Additional packing-related charges include fulfillment fees, order insert fees, and outbound shipping fees (more on shipping fees below).</p>
<p class="p10"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-7.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21289" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-7.png" alt="" width="640" height="193" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-7.png 640w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-7-300x90.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4">5. Shipping Rates</h3>
<p class="p1">One of the major advantages offered by 3PLs is the discounted rate for shipping, which is passed on to clients.</p>
<p class="p1">Chances are your business isn’t moving the same volume of goods as an entire fulfillment warehouse, so it’s beneficial to let a 3PL take control of your operation and pass along those savings to you.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead of going directly to UPS or FedEx, letting the 3PL negotiate rates for you can save you a hefty chunk of change, particularly if your volume is not at a level where it’s a negotiating asset for you with the carriers.</p>
<p class="p1">3PL’s can also help you secure discounted freight shipments, both from the port to the fulfilment house, better <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/dimensional-weight-calculator/">DIM weight factors</a>, and for international shipments.</p>
<p class="p10"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-8.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21288" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-8.png" alt="" width="640" height="386" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-8.png 1024w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-8-300x181.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-8-750x453.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Once you begin to shop around and compare providers, you’ll find that different providers cater to different needs. For example, check out these niche ecommerce fulfillment services.</p>
<h3 class="p3">6. Niche Fulfillment Services</h3>
<p class="p1">One of the best ways to identify a successful fulfillment partner is to look for a fulfillment warehouse that specializes in <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/find-product-niche-start-selling-online/">your product type’s niche</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Do all of your products contain a lithium-ion battery, thus making them fall under a hazmat classification?</li>
<li class="p1">Are you shipping mostly small, lightweight bi-fold wallets?</li>
<li class="p1">Or large electronics?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">As you can imagine, the pick, pack, and ship operations for an <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/clothing-apparel/">online store selling t-shirts</a> is going to look and operate very differently than a warehouse picking and shipping boxed furniture. If your products fall under a hazmat classification, it can be especially important to find a fulfillment partner who can ensure that your shipments don’t break any laws.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, companies like <a href="https://www.printful.com/">Printful</a> specialize in on-demand printing and fulfillment of posters, apparel, and accessories.</p>
<p class="p1">If you already have your apparel printed and ready to distribute, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/whiplash/">Whiplash Fulfillment</a> is a perfect match, particularly with their low USPS rates for those lightweight packages.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other end of the spectrum, <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/">Red Stag Fulfillment</a> specializes in ecommerce stores with an average parcel weight greater than 5 pounds and hazmat products that ship via FedEx or UPS.</p>
<p class="p1">By identifying a fulfillment provider that fits your niche, your business can not only save a significant amount of money with tailored shipping discounts, but can also avoid major headaches down the road, and even legal liabilities such as hazmat compliance.</p>
<h3 class="p3">7. Location of Your Fulfillment Partner</h3>
<p class="p1">Another critical but often overlooked question is choosing the <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/choosing-location-fulfillment-warehouse/">location of your fulfillment center</a>. In order to keep shipping costs down, it’s best to choose a provider that is strategically located near your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">This is great for smaller shops with relatively concentrated (geographically) customers, but for larger shops who ship products across the country, your outbound shipping information likely mirrors the general populous of the U.S.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s say you live and operate your ecommerce store from Miami Florida. One of the worst things you can do is limit your search for a drop-shipper, your own warehouse space, or a 3rd party fulfillment partner, to only the Miami, FL area.</p>
<p class="p1">Besides having some pretty expensive land, Miami is located in a far corner of the country meaning your parcels are going to take longer, and cost more to reach your customer’s addresses.</p>
<p class="p10"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/efulfillment-service.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21287" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/efulfillment-service.png" alt="" width="641" height="407" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/efulfillment-service.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/efulfillment-service-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If your volume is high enough, another factor to consider is sales tax nexus. Most states add on sales tax based on the destination of the items you ship, but there are a few exceptions</p>
<p class="p1">Notably, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Montana don’t levy sales tax on remote sellers (neither does Alaska, but it goes without saying that you probably want to have your logistics HQ somewhere in the lower 48).</p>
<p class="p1">Those states offer close proximity to major populations centers on the East Coast, West Coast, and Upper Midwest.</p>
<p class="p10"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21286" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-satisfaction.png" alt="" width="641" height="407" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-satisfaction.png 641w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-satisfaction-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Lastly, on the subject of location, there’s no rule saying that your entire fulfillment operation has to be centered in just one place. If you have about equal demand on both sides of the country or in both the Far East and Europe — it’s sensible to stock your items in multiple locations.</p>
<p class="p1">With this understanding of the structure of 3PLs and how they work, here’s some advice on what to look for in potential providers.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Interview Questions for 3PLs</h2>
<p class="p1">The provider you choose will determine the quality experienced by your customers, which is vital to the success of your business.</p>
<p class="p1">Being so, a lengthy interview process should be the norm. Here are 20 questions to ask your potential fulfillment partner during the interview process:</p>
<p class="p10"><img class="wp-image-21285 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3pl-questionnaire.png" alt="" width="158" height="152" /></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Removing price from the equation, why does your company stand out from the competition?</li>
<li class="p1">What sort of new technology have you introduced in the last year, and has it enhanced processes?</li>
<li class="p1">How does your employee turnover compare to industry levels, and what do you do to ensure a secure, productive, and safe environment? Do you offer incentives for high performance?</li>
<li class="p1">What sort of plans do you have in place for peak-demand scenarios such as Black Friday or other major product rushes?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you have compliance and KPI reporting that allows us to view shipping in real time?</li>
<li class="p1">How do you deal with freight claims, returns, and other less-than-ideal outcomes?</li>
<li class="p1">If there was a natural disaster, power outage, software hack, or other major disruption, how would your company react?</li>
<li class="p1">How do you coordinate with freight companies to manage shipping and account for lost or damage claims?</li>
<li class="p1">Can you provide references from clients with a similar business profile/history?</li>
<li class="p1">How many current customers do you have, how many warehouses (and where are they), and who’s on the executive team?</li>
<li class="p1">Which shipping carriers do you work with? Do you handle international shipping? What are your rates?</li>
<li class="p1">What fees do you charge? What about the “hidden” ones?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you have in-house IT and hardware repair specialists to make sure all software and equipment is running smoothly?</li>
<li class="p1">When is your cut-off time? What about operating hours?</li>
<li class="p1">What sort of value-added services, such as kitting and SKU management, do you offer?</li>
<li class="p1">What software do you use for inventory management purposes, and can you integrate on the back end of my company’s ecommerce platform? (Magento, SquareSpace, Shopify, etc.)</li>
<li class="p1">Do I sign a month-to-month contract or is it long-term?</li>
<li class="p1">How much of the U.S. can you reach within two days via ground shipping? Three days?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you provide email notifications to customers when an item has shipped?</li>
<li class="p1">Can you guarantee that you won’t ever be responsible for delayed, damaged, or lost items?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Download The Questionnaire</h3></p>
<p class="p1">If you’d like a thorough questionnaire, here’s a helpful <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/roots/assets/pdf/Fulfillment_Provider_Questionnaire_-_RSF_Answers.pdf">printable resource</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">Once you have the answers to these questions, analyze whether the provider looks like a good option. If they do, it would be wise to visit the fulfillment facility and see it for yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, it can’t hurt to do a split test. Ask for a 30-day trial period with two, or even three different fulfillment centers so you can compare them head-to-head and decide which one is best for your business.</p>
<p class="p1">By following these guidelines, businesses will be able to find a 3PL that helps their business scale up, improve profit margins, and deliver high-quality products to their customers.</p>
<p class="p1">While a 3PL is the right solution for many businesses, there are some cases where establishing your own product distribution may be advantageous. Let’s take a closer look at what is involved in this third technique and when it’s a good idea.</p>
<h2 class="p7">When to Establish Your Own Product Distribution</h2>
<p class="p1">The reality is, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/target-market-analysis/">your target market</a> may not leave drop-shipping or a third-party fulfillment partnership as viable options.</p>
<p class="p1">If your ecommerce store sells high-end, one-off, leather briefcases with custom lining, unique pocket placements, and tailored embroidery, then your business model is simply not suited for sending pallets of your product off to a fulfillment warehouse.</p>
<p class="p1">When Kayde Johnson-Anderson first founded <a href="http://www.shoplabu.com/">LaBu</a>, her goal was to create a successful side business, selling handcrafted jewelry and home goods.</p>
<p class="p10"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21284" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-la-bu.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-la-bu.png 1439w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-la-bu-300x157.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-la-bu-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Like many other startups, Kayde set up her fulfillment operation from her home in California in order to have easy access to photographing new products being added to the store and to be able to ensure adequate packaging for her first orders.</p>
<p class="p1">While Kayde has recently gone full-time operating and growing the online store, she knows she’s not quite to the point where hiring her first full-time employee to handle the pick, pack, and ship operations is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.blacknbianco.com/">Black n Bianco</a>, an online store selling children’s formal wear, started out as a retail store in California before launching its BigCommerce shop online.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-black-bianco.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21283" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-black-bianco.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-black-bianco.png 1439w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-black-bianco-300x157.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ecommerce-fulfillment-black-bianco-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">When sales began to fall for the brick-and-mortar storefront, the Black n Bianco team decided to focus on developing the company’s online presence by expanding to multiple sales channels and marketplaces, including Sears, eBay, and Kmart.</p>
<p class="p1">Robert, the company’s web manager, explained that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“managing the inventory of a brick-and-mortar store, along with the retail store, meant that we had most of the assets (including two full-time employees to handle picking and packing) in place to handle our own fulfillment. That said, using order fulfillment software tools like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/channeladvisor/">ChannelAdvisor</a> to manage inventory across multiple platforms was a critical feature we were missing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">As businesses grow, many companies choose to vertically integrate their operations with a desire to cut costs and maintain a higher level of control over processes. This can be a great business decision for a company, but with a capital-intensive investment such as an in-house fulfillment operation, businesses should wholly evaluate the total cost of such an endeavor.</p>
<p class="p1">Understanding <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/which-online-businesses-benefit-from-the-use-of-a-fulfillment-center/">which online businesses benefit from a fulfillment partner</a>, versus keeping operations in-house, is a critical evaluation step that should be thoroughly carried out before buying warehouse space. Let’s take a look at some of the issues that could be faced starting your own in-house fulfillment operation.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Understanding the Costs of Self-Fulfillment: Both Financial &amp; Time</h2>
<p class="p1">For bigger businesses looking to establish their own fulfillment operation (also called “direct order fulfillment”), the sheer number of costs and new liabilities can be overwhelming when setting up your own fulfillment center.</p>
<p class="p1">Below, we’ve outlined some of the primary consideration to look into.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Land &amp; Warehouse Space</h3>
<h4 class="p1">Rental Rate: $4 to $14 (per sq. ft.)</h4>
<p class="p1">Besides the base square footage cost, the term length of your lease contract is another primary issue to consider.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Tax implications</h4>
<p class="p1">Having a physical presence may change your requirement to charge sales tax to your customers. See the BigCommerce guide on ecommerce<a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-sales-tax/"> sales taxes</a> for more information on navigating the spider web of state taxes.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Location</h4>
<p class="p1">If your ecommerce store is purchasing or leasing warehouse space, chances are you’re looking in your immediate area. Check back to our earlier section, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jd9Oq1kSm18iHvepFqh1ZRsj0ju5pFBra4eliW6ABmE/edit#heading=h.rt1uky9qmfrk">Location of Your Fulfillment Partner</a>, for a guide on how to evaluate the best location for your product distribution.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s also fairly unlikely that you’ll have multiple warehouses of your own, at least at first. If you’re located on one of the coasts or one extreme corner of the country, you need to weight the increased cost of shipping your orders to customers further away, as well as the extended time it may take for your customers to receive an order. Ask yourself, “How valuable is being able to reach all of my customers in two days?”</p>
<h3 class="p4">Operational Capital Expenditures</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Pallet Racking:</strong> $50 to $80 per pallet position (not including installation)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Forklifts:</strong> $800 to $1,100 per Month</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Trailer loading docks:</strong> $250,000 per Dock</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Conveyors</strong>: Belted ($150 to $200 per foot), Gravity ($50 to $120 per foot.)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Computers/Tablets/Phones:</strong> (for integration with new warehouse management software) $1,000+</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p4">Software</h3>
<p class="p1">Figuring out what software tools are needed to plug in with your BigCommerce store and manage with warehouse operations can be a daunting task.</p>
<p class="p1">Platforms such as <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shiphero/">ShipHero</a> can be a lifesaver versus the time and expense of trying to create your own software program. Furthermore, software solutions such as <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/skubana/">Skubana</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shipstation/">ShipStation</a> are a great if you need to consolidate orders from multiple storefronts or marketplaces, or sync availability with a drop-shipper or third-party fulfillment partner.</p>
<p class="p1">Other apps, such as <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/aftership/">AfterShip</a>, can be a lifesaver by passing all parcel tracking information along to your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">The necessary software solutions exist in the BigCommerce App store. Sure, there’s usually a monthly or per-order cost associated with each one, but the real cost to consider is the day-to-day managing of integrations between multiple apps, your storefront, and your customers, which in itself can create a need for a new full-time tech guru at your company.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Workforce</h3>
<p class="p1">How easy will it be for you to hire and train (plus training materials and SOP documentation) a workforce to run your warehouse? You may only need two or three additional people, but depending on the size of your existing workforce, an increase in headcount could have <a href="https://www.zenefits.com/answers/we-are-about-to-hit-50-employees-what-are-some-of-the-hr-compliance-areas-i-should-consider/">other implications on your business</a>.</p>
<h4 class="p1">Seasonality</h4>
<p class="p1">If you’re going to be hiring new people, you need to have a plan in place to deal with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/holiday-hiring-help-how-to-find-quality-employees-for-the-holiday-rush/">seasonality, particularly around the holidays</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Shipping Rate Discounts with Carriers</h3>
<p class="p1">Negotiating your own shipping discounts can be a hard mountain to climb, but once established, these discounts can serve as a competitive advantage and even an additional profit center for your business.</p>
<p class="p1">The primary factor when weighing your negotiating power is your monthly order volume</p>
<p class="p1">The more you ship, the more negotiating power you’ll have with carriers. A secondary factor is the weight distribution of your volume.</p>
<p class="p1">If the majority of your outbound parcels are within a 5-pound weight bracket, this concentration of volume can help you earn the best discounts where it will save you the most money. Keep in mind that thanks to the ongoing changes to <a href="http://redstagfulfillment.com/dimensional-weight-calculator/">dimensional weight</a>, your 3-pound container of protein may actually end up being billed at 7 or 8 pounds.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, for businesses who have low volume, or whose volume is spread thin across the weight tables, a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/#cmtoc_anchor_id_2">profitable ecommerce shipping strategy</a> may be hard to establish.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Changes to Core Competency</h3>
<p class="p1">The biggest question to ask is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Will setting up my own fulfillment operation give me a unique competitive advantage?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Going back to Craig Rabin’s example with the launch of <a href="https://theairhook.com/">The AirHook</a>, when your ecommerce store hits it big and sees a massive uptick in orders, it’s critical that you take advantage of this positive trend and fulfill orders in such a way that your customers’ expectations are exceeded (or, at a minimum, met), in order to ensure a continued relationship with these customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Often, this means offering free two-day shipping, with orders shipped on the same day, 100% perfectly picked orders, and fast return processing.</p>
<p class="p1">For most ecommerce stores, these areas of focus are outside the core competencies that created the growth in order volume in the first place. Since <a href="https://theairhook.com/">The AirHook</a> only sells a single product in a handful of different colors, Craig is able to manage the month-to-month domestic order fulfillment following the KickStarter surge.</p>
<p class="p1">But for ecommerce stores with hundreds or even thousands of SKUs, a valuable third-party fulfillment provider is a critical partnership to have to ensure that your time is spent handling the primary drivers of your business, such as <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/content-marketing-ecommerce-traffic/">growing your online traffic</a>, or carrying out <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/visual-merchandising/">innovative new marketing tactics</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p7">Final Word</h3>
<p class="p1">Now that you understand the three main options for ecommerce fulfillment — including when to use them and how to get started — you’re ready to take a look at your business and decide which is the best fit.</p>
<p class="p1">The first step is to understand what your goals are if you’re evaluating a new fulfillment technique.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Are you looking to improve your warehouse/pick, pack, ship efficiency?</li>
<li class="p1">Are you looking to save on shipping cost?</li>
<li class="p1">Are you looking to expand your product offerings?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Also, understand what stage your business is in, and where you hope a new order fulfillment model will help to evolve.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Are you a startup on a lean budget looking to start making sales? Or an established business that wants to test out a new market?
<ul>
<li class="p1">Is your goal to grow your business over the next 5 years and then sell the company? Or are you long-term focused and looking to find a fulfilment partner that can enable your company to grow for decades?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1">For medium-sized businesses that already have demand for their products or services and have the capital to invest in inventory, 3PLs are a great fit. You can outsource all of the hassle to experts, increase your profit margins, and focus on the parts of your business that will impact your bottom line the most.</li>
<li class="p1">Lastly, if your online store specializes in high-end speciality items, self-fulfillment is often the way to go. Just understand all that’s involved from a time and capital perspective before committing to this model.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The right solution for you is going to depend on what type of product or services you are selling and where your business is in its development.</p>
<p class="p1">Keep this guide on hand to refer back to and identify the right technique based on your unique situation. If you have any questions, send them over in the comments section below.</p>
<p class="p1">Order fulfillment is a truly integrated part of your supply chain that all other business aspects depend on, so choose wisely!</p>

Optimizing it can help you to:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Save money</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">Ship products to customers</a> in a timely manner</li>
<li class="p1">Keep your ecommerce store running as smoothly as possible</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Inventory ties into every element of your store, from supply, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-warehousing/">to warehousing</a>, to order fulfilment and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p class="p1">But, great inventory management can also increase your sales.</p>
<p class="p1">How? Managing your inventory properly across all of your sales channels helps to lower your product cost and increase shipping speed – ultimately earning you increased customer loyalty and love.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the Amazon model –– and it isn’t out of reach for your business.</p>
<p class="p1">If you scale too quickly without <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/inventory-management-software/">the proper inventory management setup</a>, you may find yourself running out of stock (or having to raise your prices to avoid selling out, resulting in unhappy customers), losing track of your inventory (which warehouse was that in again?), or losing profit margins to inefficient processes.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the most important methods, concepts, and techniques that you can employ right now to ensure that doesn’t happen, and your inventory management solution is an asset not a liability, for your business.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Use Data to Make a Difference</h2>
<p class="p1">Managing inventory creates data, which you can use to streamline processes and improve your inventory and order management.</p>
<p class="p1">If you know how much you sell, when you sell it and hopefully why –– you can use that data to calculate how much stock you should have and when. That way, you can switch to more effective management options, predict sales, and manage your actual stock to create value.</p>
<p class="p1">At <a href="http://www.webretailer.com/lean-commerce/crucial-chad-rubin-amazon/">Think Crucial</a> – my personal ecommerce venture –– we used inventory data to scale a small Amazon store into a multi-channel ecommerce business, driving <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/selling-on-amazon/">$5 million in revenue per year</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">We looked at sales by channel, per period, turn, costs, profit per product, and average product lifespan. The data enabled us to improve inventory management and to forecast sales, which reduced unnecessary stock and cut costs.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21212" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="539" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana.jpg 1283w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana-300x253.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana-750x632.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Like Think Crucial, you can use inventory data to calculate how much stock you need throughout the year.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Connect with Skubana Now</h3></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">Want to use Skubana to help manage your multi-channel inventory? <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/skubana/">There&#8217;s a one-click app for that</a>.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"></div></p>
<h3 class="p3">Forecast Sales</h3>
<p class="p1">Sales forecasting is a skill that will allow you to use your existing data for future predictions.</p>
<p class="p1">While you can use statistical analysis or a tool for the purpose, simply projecting your current sales data (hopefully 1-5 years) onto a line chart and following the line up at the same rate of increase will allow you to make reasonable predictions.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if you have sold product A for 18 months with an average sales growth of 1.2% per month, you can estimate that you will continue to see that same growth.</p>
<p class="p1">This tells you how much of each product you are likely to sell for any given period, because you can use the previous year&#8217;s sales for that month or week to predict your sales for the coming year.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are a BigCommerce merchant, you can use BigCommerce&#8217;s out-of-the-box analytics to drill down into your individual product or SKU sales over various periods –– and use that to forecast.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s what that looks like on the backend:</p>

<p class="p1">You’ll likely need to update your forecast model once per quarter –– adjusting based on actual growth versus expected growth to improve future predictions –– which is where the export tool comes in handy.</p>
<p class="p1">Effective forecasting can be thrown off by abnormalities in one sales channel, so the better your grasp on your demand generation, the better you can predict overall trends.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is a view BigCommerce merchants can use to drill down into channel activity:</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21205" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4.png" alt="" width="640" height="328" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4.png 1155w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4-300x154.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4-750x384.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<h3 class="p3">Identify Trends</h3>
<p class="p1">Sales trends include events like holidays, cold and hot weather, and popular opinion that drive sales up or down for one product or another, as well as trends in behavior.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, an ecommerce store specializing in selling teddy bears with hearts could expect to see a rise in sales around Valentine&#8217;s day, but also throughout spring, when couples tend to get engaged or married.</p>
<p class="p1">Identifying your sales trends should be a simple matter of identifying spikes in sales and pinpointing why — then adjusting inventory levels accordingly. If you can identify why sales have gone up, you can decide if that spike is a one-time thing or will happen again next year under the same circumstances.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, a spike in sales for rain boots before a hurricane means that you can probably skip using that trend in forecast data, but the same spike in May, which is typically a rainy month, probably means it&#8217;s a seasonal trend.</p>
<p class="p1">Beyond identifying trends that are driving up sales for inventory management, it’s smart to identify trends beforehand and prepare marketing campaigns to drive even more revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a basic calendar for the U.S for 2017. <a href="http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/usa/">You can see other countries here.</a></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21208" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-calendar.png" alt="" width="640" height="390" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-calendar.png 716w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-calendar-300x183.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3 class="p3">Know Your Par Levels</h3>
<p class="p1">Par levels, or Periodic Automatic Replenishment, is the minimum stock you can have on hand when you place a new order.</p>
<p class="p1">Par is basically safety stock, which prevents you from selling out in between orders.</p>
<p class="p1">You can calculate your Par level using:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Lead time</li>
<li class="p1">Sales forecast</li>
<li class="p1">Seasonal demand</li>
<li class="p1">Any back orders you may have</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you don&#8217;t have backorders and you&#8217;ve calculated seasonal demand into your sales forecast, par level is a simple calculation.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Lead Time x Expected Sales Per Period = Safety Stock</em></p>
<p class="p6"><strong>See this in action</strong></p>
<p class="p1">If you sell an average of 10 units per day and have a lead time of 21 days, you must have a minimum stock of 210 units when you place a new order.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>10 x 21 = 210</em></p>
<p class="p2"> However, you should add an additional safety margin.</p>
<p class="p1">You might still need some time to add the new stock to your inventory, the order might be delayed, you might have returns, and you might have an unexpected surge in sales.</p>
<p class="p1">For this reason, you should calculate at least 10% over your minimum safety stock. In this case, 221 units would be enough to ensure that you won&#8217;t sell out under normal conditions.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>210 x .1 = 21</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>210 + 21 = 221</em></p>
<p class="p1">Tools like Skubana allow you to automate this process by setting <a href="https://support.skubana.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003960047-Auto-Reorder-Rules-">automatic reorder points</a> based on par levels, so your inventory never dips below par. These levels are set automatically by the system and changed constantly based on how your items are selling.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21207" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6.png" alt="" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6.png 698w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6-300x147.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Par levels need to be reported out on a business level, across channels — including Amazon, physical store, and your webstore. Failing to account for one of these can throw off your ability to fulfill and manage orders from any sales channel.</p>
<p class="p1">On BigCommerce, you can see revenue from your various channels, including storefront, Amazon, Instagram, Facebook, eBay, etc. To see orders from those channels and measure Par levels, you’ll need to export your order list.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21203" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="285" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2.png 1136w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2-300x133.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2-750x333.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3">Keep an Eye on Sales Turns</h3>
<p class="p1">Sales turnover for your industry can help you to better understand how much product you should keep on hand based on the industry.</p>
<p class="p1">If you have access to trade benchmarks for your industry, you can use those.</p>
<p class="p1">Otherwise, <a href="https://www.retailowner.com/Benchmarks">Benchmarks.com</a> offers free industry standards which you can use as a guideline. Simply find the inventory turnover for your industry, and divide the period in a year you want to use by that number.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, let’s look at days, weeks, or months.</p>
<p class="p1">If we were to apply that with the category &#8220;online shopping&#8221; which has an average inventory turnover rate of 5.5, we could calculate that a turn is 2.18 months, 9.45 weeks, or 66 days, which is the maximum inventory supply you should have on hand.</p>
<p class="p1">That is:</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>12 months / 5.5 = 2.18</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>52 weeks / 5.5 = 9.45</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>365 days / 5.5 = 66.36 </em></p>
<p class="p1">Once you have calculated your turns, you can use this rate to directly calculate your maximum inventory per period. This rate is simply your calculated sales for the period x the turnover period.</p>
<p class="p1">In most cases, you should not have more than 1 turns worth of inventory on hand at any one time.</p>
<p class="p1">Chances are that you already have the data to perform these calculations.</p>
<h2 class="p6">The Just in Time Inventory Model</h2>
<p class="p1">You can also use these same calculations to integrate new multichannel inventory management models.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, JIT or Just in Time inventory is a model that focuses on reducing costs by stocking the minimum amount to prevent a stock out event.</p>
<p class="p1">This allows you to reduce warehousing volume, take some of the burden off inventory management, and reduce total inventory storage costs.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2011/WCE2011_pp904-908.pdf">Toyota</a> is possibly one of the largest and most notorious companies to implement JIT inventory. Using it, Toyota was able to reduce costs, reduce storage costs, improve lead times, reduce waste, and reduce employee man-hours spent in counting and quality checking stock.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21213" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota.png" alt="" width="640" height="331" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota.png 1452w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota-750x388.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3">Is Low Inventory Always the Solution?</h3>
<p class="p1">While it can be tempting to think that keeping your inventory as low as possible is the easiest way to save money, you must also consider your supplier or manufacturer.</p>
<p class="p1">Ordering to the manufacturer’s EOQ or Economic Order Quantity allows you to save considerably on product purchase costs. If you order less, you will pay more per product, which may not offset the cost saved in warehousing and inventory management. If your demand is over EOQ, this is likely not a consideration.</p>
<p class="p1">Great inventory is about keeping enough stock on hand to meet customer demand so that you can fulfill quickly, while keeping it low enough to reduce costs and the burden on your warehousing.</p>
<p class="p1">And with customers making purchases from more touchpoints than ever before, you need to have the infrastructure to support multi-channel fulfillment.</p>
<p class="p2">Grant Yuan, President at <a href="https://www.cuttingboard.com/">CuttingBoard LLC</a>, attributes much of his business’s growth to proper inventory management across channels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Prior to inventory management software, we would manually sync our inventory levels each night using spreadsheets. It was tedious work that no one wanted to do.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, once CuttingBoard.com became bigger and we carried more SKUs, we started getting issues with stock outs and overselling product on places and having to cancel shipments.</p>
<p class="p1">It resulted in an extremely poor experience for our customers.</p>
<p class="p1">We realized we needed an automated system to update our inventory on the fly. Luckily, after testing a few systems, we found Skubana and have been with it ever since.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, we use Skubana to pull in our BigCommerce, eBay and Amazon orders into one centralized platform, which saves countless hours versus logging into each system separately.</p>
<p class="p1">I am a firm believer in embracing technology and tools that make our store deliver a superior experience for not just our customers, but my staff using our systems. This one in particular makes me very happy.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Understand Actual Profits</h2>
<p class="p1">While great inventory management can help you to reduce total costs, it can also help you to understand them so that you better understand your minimum sales points, which will allow you to make better use of repricing automation, marketing, sales and offers, and other tools to streamline sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Real cost of inventory is the total cost of the product, warehousing, delivery, marketing and merchandising.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Freight costs <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Cost of backorders<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Actual cost of inventory<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Interest on money borrowed for inventory <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Inventory damage/loss/theft <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Management costs <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Order management and inventory control</li>
<li class="p1">Dead stock <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Warehousing costs (rent, maintenance, electric, gas, inspections, employees)<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can calculate warehousing costs by determining how much of your warehouse the product uses, and dividing total costs by that.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if your top selling product is 1/100th of your inventory, 10% of your total warehousing costs belong to that product.</p>
<p class="p1">You can perform similar calculations to estimate freight costs per product. If you receive a shipment with 100 products, you can divide shipping costs based on product volume.</p>
<p class="p1">Your total sales per product minus the total costs of that product is your actual profit per product.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if you have an inventory value of $100,000 for Product A, which will drive $500,000 in total sales, you could use the following example to see an idea of where your money might be going.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21215" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="996" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet.jpg 650w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet-300x467.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In this example, you are spending 26.8% of total earnings on inventory without considering marketing, merchandising, website costs, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">You can easily perform a full calculation, including items like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Ecommerce software<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Merchandising <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Marketing <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Inventory management software<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Accounting <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Website hosting <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In most cases, your actual profits will go up and down depending on the time of year, market trends, seasonal demand, and other factors.</p>
<p class="p1">You can use your sales forecasts to calculate your total costs for each turn, which will allow you to make better decisions for marketing. Inventory costs are typically between 10 and 40% of total inventory value.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if you know your total costs, you can set better minimum pricing, which will allow you to use automatic repricing. This can help you to maintain the lowest cost product without undercutting yourself, so that you can own Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200401830">buy box buttons</a>, earn features on Walmart, and make Jet.com work for you.</p>
<p class="p1">Taking a step back to understand the whole supply chain can reveal insights you miss while head down in day-to-day operations.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Streamline Multichannel Inventory Management to Improve Customer Satisfaction</h2>
<p class="p1">Inventory management plays a large part in customer satisfaction because it impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Logistics</li>
<li class="p1">Order availability</li>
<li class="p1">Costs</li>
<li class="p1">Delivery times</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For example, some ecommerce businesses attempt to reduce inventory as much as possible by working with drop shipping or by spot ordering, but this reduces your ability to turn fulfill orders so that the customer gets them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">Jason Boyce, co-founder and CEO of Dazadi, understands this well –– and even cut his business off <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-failure-to-success/">from $2,000,000 in revenue</a> in order to increase customer satisfaction for the long run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“We noticed our performance metrics, on time delivery and order errors were significantly higher with our drop shippers than they were with our own inventory, with our own fulfillment centers. We had to make a drastic change,” says Boyce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">“So, we set out to open additional fulfillment centers and end our drop shipping relationships.  Today, we have four across the country, excluding the stuff we send off to Amazon FBA. Doing this forced us to reduce how many SKUs we offered, but now, we can focus on each individual SKU as an asset and build it up with SEO and customer satisfaction from purchase to delivery.”</p>
<p class="p1">Good inventory management will allow you to optimize your inventory control to balance between being able to quickly fulfill orders while keeping warehousing and managing costs as low as possible.</p>
<h2 class="p6">Real Time Inventory</h2>
<p class="p1">Integrating tools for <a href="https://www.skubana.com/multi-channel-inventory-management/">real-time inventory management</a> allows you to manage and track orders across sales channels, so that you always know your real inventory and don&#8217;t drop below par level.</p>
<p class="p1">This makes it easier to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Track re-order points to prevent a stockout</li>
<li class="p1">Track actual sales</li>
<li class="p1">Prioritize fulfilment for popular items</li>
<li class="p1">Manage returns and replacement items.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Each of these will, in turn, boost your order fulfilment speed so that customers get the item they want as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p6">EDI</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Amazon Inventory &amp; Order Management Solutions</h2>
<p class="p1">If you are a multi-channel seller, keeping track of your overall inventory levels can get tricky. If you oversell inventory, you upset customers and are on the fast track to getting your Amazon account suspended. And if you undersell, you have lost out on sales. You need to have real-time inventory numbers to manage inventory by channel, giving you the ability to replenish FBA quickly (if required) or place new product orders with your suppliers if you are running out on critical selection.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">There is quite a bit of variation across inventory and order management companies. Some charge a percentage of sales, while others charge by the number of orders processed. Some incorporate sophisticated analytics and purchase order management tools, while others incorporate some listing functionality, repricers, accounting software integration and shipping rate optimization tools. Also, not all marketplaces can be handled by each inventory and order management tool today. Careful due diligence on such centrally critical software is necessary for the individual business owner.</p>
<p class="p1">Ask each company:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What&#8217;s included and what&#8217;s not?</li>
<li class="p1">How much automation of which steps can the software do?</li>
<li class="p1">How much flexibility do you have to roll into or out of the software? How long is the on-boarding process, and what &#8220;house-in-order&#8221; steps are required of you to get started?</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">For a seller looking to build and house its listing data in one place, as well as to coordinate inventory across multiple marketplaces, the multichannel sales providers offer a suitable solution.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">While the combined use of a listing solution and an inventory and order management solution may be appropriate for some sellers, other sellers solve the listing-inventory-order issue using a single solution. For sellers using this second option, the companies below offer support to multi-channel sellers, getting their listings and inventory organized and pushed out to various sales channels.</p>

<p class="p1">Do you pride yourself on moving into bigger warehouses every couple of years, all because your business keeps growing? Are you spending more and more of your time managing your warehouse (staff, equipment, operations), rather than building your business? You probably didn&#8217;t become an entrepreneur to become an expert on the intricacies of managing a warehouse.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">While competitively-priced 3PLs can be more expensive than the out-of-pocket costs of running your own warehouse, your most precious asset is your time to spend on building your business. Be prepared to spend a little more on warehousing through a 3PL in order to free yourself up from all of the headaches a warehouse often brings a small business owner.</p>
<p class="p1">Not all 3PLs are equally experienced at FBA prep, poly bagging, bundling and kitting. Do your research carefully, and talk with case study clients that the 3PL provides. Also, expect some transition period up front as you train the 3PL employees on exactly the process you want for your order processing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Return Management &amp; Reverse Logistics Services</h2>
<p class="p1">As the number of orders increases, so too will your number of returns. Those returns can be rather annoying to manage and often include the inspection, grading and testing, upgrading, repackaging, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">Given that customers rarely send back all of the product, warranty, instruction manual and packaging, there is likely to be additional work needed to attempt to convert a returned item to a re-sellable item (hopefully in &#8220;new&#8221; form again).</p>
<p class="p1">If you have more than one full-time employee working just on returns, it&#8217;s time to be asking questions to these solution providers to see if they can streamline this headache for you.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Returns can cost you money in return fees and repackaging, but they also cost a disproportionate amount of time to repair versus selling a unit newly sourced from your supplier. There is a size-able opportunity cost to managing returns, both in terms of time, and potentially the lack of expertise on how to maximize recovery rates on those returns. These solution providers know the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s on how to make the returns process less painful and costly for you.</p>

<p class="p1">Every company needs to keep track of its financial position, including expenses such as payroll and insurance, purchase orders, inventory value and margins. The following software programs are commonly used by online sellers to track these numbers.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">While Amazon is not known for providing sales and revenue data that can be easily incorporated into accounting software, some of the companies below have developed API and conversion tools to absorb existing Amazon data into their tools. Further simplify your life by looking for accounting software that integrates into Amazon&#8217;s Seller Central.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Accounting and Bookkeeping Support</h2>
<p class="p1">Long before you have a mountain of shoeboxes full of receipts, it is important to be tracking all of your income and costs. This way,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>you can maintain a macro view of your financial position at any given moment, rather than waiting until year-end when taxes are due.</p>
<p class="p1">Face it; almost no one likes recording all of their financial data, but it&#8217;s necessary to know where you are doing well and where improvements are immediately needed. Rather than put unnecessary lags between paperwork coming in and you understanding how that paperwork reflects your true financial position, these solution providers offer you the ability to keep an eye on your financials without having to deal with the laborious task of sporadic, manual data entry.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">These companies can offer basic book-keeping, or full-scale accounting (including income tax preparation and inventory reconciliation support). Depending on how complex your inventory and channels are, you may want to outsource more and more of this to focus on your skills sourcing profitable product.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Tax Calculation and Remittance</h2>
<p class="p1">In which states do you owe sales tax? Are you collecting enough sales tax in enough states?</p>
<p class="p1">If you can&#8217;t answer these questions today, it&#8217;s time to look for support. And if you can answer these questions, and you&#8217;re required to pay in more than 2-3 states each quarter, you probably could benefit from the streamlined processes these companies will be able to provide you. No more manually filing papers to each required state. These companies will streamline all of that for you, and keep on top of ever-changing tax rules for each tax jurisdiction (state, county, city, etc.) in which you have tax nexus.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Whether you collect state tax or not on your online sales, you almost certainly are liable for paying the state taxes. Work with your tax attorney to confirm where you owe state taxes, and then consider using Amazon&#8217;s tax collection services to streamline the collection process, while using any of these solution providers to support the tax remittance process.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Profitability Analysis</h2>
<p class="p1">If you understand your all-in-costs by SKU, you can figure out your profitability by SKU, which will guide your actions on inventory management, vendor negotiations, sourcing of new products and pricing. If you keep your total sales revenue and total gross margin each aggregated, then you have no visibility on specific product issues or opportunities which ultimately drive your overall profitability. Most sellers realize they need more granular profitability analysis when they experience YOY sales growth that is not matched by at least the same growth in YOY gross margins.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p3">Rarely do all products in a seller’s catalog generate positive margins, once consideration for indirect and overhead costs are made. Only at the point that all costs have been allocated down to the individual SKU level can a seller take immediate necessary action to course-correct on product selection.</p>
<p class="p1">Please note that many of the inventory and order management tools have incorporated profitability analysis tools into their overall structure. These companies below are stand-alone applications.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Cash Management Tools / Financing Options</h2>
<p class="p1">Most entrepreneurs think they need more capital. Depending on how well organized your accounting books are, there are plenty of organizations that will lend various amounts of money to build up your businesses.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Being an Amazon seller can be risky if you’re not paying attention to the road all the time. Bringing lenders into the equation adds more risk – risk that can be well managed if you are properly managing your overall business.</p>
<p class="p1">If you don’t know what you are doing as an Amazon seller, it’s probably best not to get too involved in using some else’s money.</p>
<p class="p1">As an FBA seller, you won’t be able to grant “first lien” rights to most lenders, as Amazon doesn’t allow anyone into their fulfillment centers to take control of inventory used as collateral in a loan. So be prepared to get very little funding based purely on the value of FBA inventory – other assets are required typically.</p>

The two had a mutual acquaintance, but came from vastly different backgrounds.</p>
<p class="p1">See, Jered had spent the better part of a decade in online marketing and ecommerce strategy. He’d founded a couple of his own ventures, consulted with a few scaling businesses and had most recently directed and led the North American online growth strategy for Epson, one of the world’s <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/electronics/">largest consumer electronics brands</a> which pulls in upward of $3 billion in annual revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">The two decided to have an exploratory conversation about the potential future of Diamond Mattress –– a four-generation old company still selling solely B2B. As it turns out, the duo quickly found they shared a common way of thinking.</p>
<p class="p1">Their next steps were clear. Mattresses were no longer being sold only through brick-and-mortar locations. Consumers were flocking in droves to online purchases of all kinds –– and even mattresses found loyal fans there.</p>
<p class="p1">It was time for Diamond Mattress to go direct –– and Jered knew exactly how to differentiate it from the competition. He put in his two weeks and started full time developing a new brand: <a href="https://hyphensleep.com/">Hyphen</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">He was back in the startup arena, this time armed and ready with the manufacturing expertise of an industry-veteran retailer to bring American-made mattresses to consumers’ doorsteps.</p>
<p class="p1">But first, he needed to create a product crafted specifically for the online buyer. In other words, he needed to figure out how to manufacture a quality mattress at a consumer-friendly price point –– shipping included.</p>
<h2 class="p3">A New Era for American Manufacturing</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16984" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0272.jpg" alt="160217_HyphenFactory_0272" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0272.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0272-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">In the early 00s, in the throes of the Great Recession, American manufacturing experienced a mass exodus of sorts. The raw cost of producing goods in the U.S. rose, while sales flatlined or sunk altogether.</p>
<p class="p1">This was no unpatriotic departure. It was business strategy. Find cheaper labor to produce quality at parity to your stateside manufacturer, cut the costs for the end consumer and hope the cheaper price keeps your business afloat.</p>
<p class="p1">It was outsource or get out.</p>
<p class="p1">It was during this time, too, brands such as Warby Parker began to oust traditional retailers like Luxottica from their stronghold market. Lower cost, better customer experience –– and all of it done by going direct to consumer and avoiding any middlemen.</p>
<p class="p1">Some have called this shift in business strategy a “pricing race to the bottom,” and certainly those brands which have found a way to lower costs while maintaining margins have benefitted. Amazon is more profitable now than ever –– and consumers have grown accustomed to price comparisons and free shipping offers.</p>
<p class="p1">There is no going back. Price is a war in all retail segments –– and cutting costs while maintaining quality is the ammunition.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>But American manufacturing is experiencing a grassroots revival.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Sure, Asian countries can produce goods at a scale simply not legal by worker rights standards back in the U.S. And sure, consumers aren’t much budging on their demand for lower cost goods.</p>
<p class="p1">There have certainly been efforts to educate consumers on the long-term effects of low cost goods produced at scale (human rights violations half a world away, increased amounts of garbage contributing to ocean pollution and global warming, so on and so forth). Conscious consumerism is on-going and gaining momentum.</p>
<p class="p1">But there’s innovation happening on the homefront, too. New technologies are leading to new ways of thinking. Call it, if you will, the second wave of the Industrial Revolution. You read about it every day. You already own some of the products. You at least recognize the leading brands.</p>
<p class="p1">Manufacturing in the U.S. is no longer your grandfather’s assembly line job. Rather, American warehouses are paving the way toward the future of IoT, robotics and drones.</p>
<p class="p1">See, there’s one thing native to the U.S. that can outpace all else: homegrown ingenuity. And Jered has plenty of it.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The Nuts and Bolts of Going Direct</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16990" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-07-27-at-3.26.52-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-27 at 3.26.52 PM" width="750" height="328" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-07-27-at-3.26.52-PM.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-07-27-at-3.26.52-PM-300x131.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Most startups begin with investors, or are bootstrapped by the founders. Then, the company begins a process of product market fit. Usually, the goal is to go live –– and then iterate on the product as feedback comes in.</p>
<p class="p1">Jered didn’t see that being the path for his new venture.</p>
<p class="p1">By partnering with Diamond Matress, an established manufacturer in the space, he nabbed himself not only credibility –– but a warehouse, a production facility and all necessary industry connections.</p>
<p class="p1">He also had cash flow and an audience.</p>
<p class="p1">With competitors already launched and gaining momentum, access to surveying and market research was critical.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“We really did a lot of development work. It took a long time,” said Jered. “ We wanted to throw out all preconceived notions and just start from scratch. So we initially started out doing surveys to find out what people care about when they&#8217;re buying a mattress. What are their biggest concerns? What product features would be most compelling for them?”</em></p>
<p class="p1">A few things popped up –– much of which was passed on to the parent manufacturing company as the team built out mattress prototypes for testing. Topping the list of consumer concerns or things people look for when buying a mattress were:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Firmness</li>
<li class="p1">A cooling factor</li>
<li class="p1">Antimicrobial protection</li>
<li class="p1">Ease of movement, or what Jered calls ‘feeling stuck’: “There&#8217;s also the adult bedroom activities. You can read about it online. They&#8217;ll talk about it in a completely blunt fashion –– memory foam beds aren&#8217;t as good for sex as a spring bed.”</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16991" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-07-27-at-3.27.05-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-27 at 3.27.05 PM" width="750" height="295" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-07-27-at-3.27.05-PM.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-07-27-at-3.27.05-PM-300x118.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Jered wanted Hyphen’s new mattress –– which would likely be foam –– to address each of these concerns. So, more than 1,000 mattress prototypes were created –– many of which required a full night’s sleep in order to provide valuable feedback on the design.</p>
<p class="p1">“Some you could tell very quickly, ‘all right this isn&#8217;t working.’ Others require actual ‘let me sleep in this’ testing,’” says Jered.</p>
<p class="p1">In all, Jered’s new product solved for all four consumer-identified points.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Solving for Firmness</h3>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“We held focus groups and looked at not only the ‘How did it feel when you first laid on it?’ factor because there&#8217;s all these factors at play. There&#8217;s pressure relief, firmness and how quickly the bed recovers its shape.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>You go to a traditional retail store and pretty much every mattress in there has a firm, medium or plush option. It&#8217;s true that everybody has their own preference, but the vast majority of people congregate in the middle of that spectrum.”</em></p>
<h3 class="p1">Solving for Temperature</h3>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“From a temperature regulation aspect, one of the things we worked really hard on was to try to make sure that the bed did not sleep hot. That is a more common complaint of foam beds.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Our top layer is both ventilated and open cell –– which is fairly standard. Then [the mattress] is also infused with copper, which is hyper-conductive and helps draw heat away from the body.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Our mattress also leverages what’s called dual point phase change technology. Basically what that means is that there are molecules that are in the foam that change structure in response to temperature. They are programmed, if you will, to absorb or relieve heat based upon bookended temperature points to help basically regulate body temperature throughout the night.”</em></p>
<h3 class="p1">Solving for antimicrobial protection</h3>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“The market research helped inform some of the product features as well. One of those is the anti-microbial protection. I was surprised at how important that type of thing was to the consumer.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I&#8217;m sure that the notion of anything in your bed kind of creeps people out, so the more we can do to just protect against that the better. Our mattresses have two layers of antimicrobial protection –– one in the foam and one in the mattress cover itself.”</em></p>
<h3 class="p1">Solving for the –– ahem –– adult bedroom activity complains</h3>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“We have three layers of foam in our mattress. Two of them are pre-existing foam formulations that we were able to use, and we chose them for specific properties.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Then, we combined those with our Hyphen foam, which is a custom foam formulation. With that we were able to get both the right amount of bounce and the right amount of responsiveness in the foam. The bounce is important.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">But end product wasn’t the only need Jered was solving for. Sure, by manufacturing the bed himself, he could get costs down and build a product that solved for multiple foam mattress pain points.</p>
<p class="p1">But now, he needed to figure out how the heck to get a 47-90 pound mattress to a consumer without breaking the bank.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The Effects of Dimensional Weight Shipping</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16988" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0327.jpg" alt="160217_HyphenFactory_0327" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0327.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0327-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Mattresses have been sold wholesale for centuries for a couple reasons: 1) the internet is still a relatively new invention and 2) because shipping large, heavy items is insanely expensive and the margins just don’t add up.</p>
<p class="p1">But with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/consumer-behavior-infographic/">consumer behavior shifting so predominantly to online buying</a>, it’s essential that brands offer a digital purchasing experience. This is even more true if a brand wants to earn the loyalty and buying dollars of generations Y and Z.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, today’s shopping environment relies heavily on customer experience. Forcing a customer to go to a brick-and-mortar mattress shop, lay on multiple beds others have already laid on, and then transport their mattress to their home (and pay for all of it) is just a terrible CX.</p>
<p class="p1">The only thing that was standing between a positive mattress shopping experience was weight and size.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, like many brands did in the early 2000s, Hyphen could have chosen to offset costs by outsourcing the bed production. Cheaper worker wages and material would increase margins –– and shipping, while expensive, may have been more affordable.</p>
<p class="p1">But Diamond Mattress is dedicated to American manufacturing –– and Jered wanted hands-on quality control.</p>
<p class="p1">No, the solution wasn’t to outsource. It was to innovate.</p>

<h3 class="p1">First, a note on weight.</h3>
<p class="p1">Gravity is a defining principle of life on earth, and in our universe –– at least as far as physics is concerned. Weight isn’t an element we can well control or change. This is why shipping is so heavily based on weight.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://shippingeasy.com/dimensional-weight-calculator/">Dimensional weight</a> pricing, introduced by shipping companies in 2015, however, created a fundamental shift in how businesses thought about shipping goods and products.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, no longer did only weight matter. Size had always been a factor –– but much less so –– and as such, brands shipping large, but light items (a canvas, for example) weren’t paying much for shipping at all. But, large boxes take up room, so shipping companies understandably implemented dimensional weight pricing, where the price of shipping an item is based on a combination calculation of box size and actual weight.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Now, a note on size.</h3>
<p class="p1">You can’t alter the weight of a product, but you can change its size. To solve for shipping expenses, a mattress couldn’t game the scale, but it could perform a shrinking function.</p>
<p class="p1">In terms of dimensional weight pricing, this is good news. The less space you take up, even if heavy, the less price you pay. Smaller box, smaller price tag.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Meet Hyphen’s Compressor</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16983" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0381.jpg" alt="160217_HyphenFactory_0381" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0381.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0381-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">I had a lot of questions to ask Jered when it came to his “bed-in-a-box” model. See, if you order a Hyphen mattress, it will come to your doorstep in a tall, thin box. When you open that box, your queen mattress will be inside, rolled up like a sardine.</p>
<p class="p1">Hyphen is by no means the first to use this technology –– but Jered’s team is definitely one of the few. So, the question begged to be asked: “How?”</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“It&#8217;s really pretty interesting,” Jered tells me, edge of my seat. “The technology to compress and roll a mattress has actually been around for 20 years. We&#8217;re not inventing anything new there and we&#8217;re not the first one to the bed-in-the-box market either. But, the machinery –– it takes special equipment to do it –– it&#8217;s gotten better and better over time.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There&#8217;s a lot of nuance to understanding how much can you compress a bed. Do you need to adjust the sizes that you&#8217;re cutting in order to get a specific end product sizing, post-compression? What types of foam –– what densities of foam –– work well with compression? Which don’t?</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>It takes a minute or two to complete each mattress. I like to describe it as this: I have a food saver at home. We&#8217;ll buy stuff from Costco and we&#8217;ll vacuum seal it. It reminds me of almost a giant food saver in that the mattress goes in and it sort of gets wrapped. It goes into a sheet of clear plastic. Then the bed is compressed both laterally and vertically and then when it&#8217;s in that compressed state, it&#8217;s not 100% sealed but it&#8217;s 98% sealed together and then it gets rolled. When it gets rolled, it gets wrapped with another piece of plastic on top of it to hold it all together.<span class="s1">”</span></em></p>
<p class="p1">This is American manufacturing ingenuity at play. There’s only one remaining need: a quality product that will actually spring back to its intended use form.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16985" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0389.jpg" alt="160217_HyphenFactory_0389" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0389.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0389-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“It&#8217;s pretty cool to see the first time, especially with a mattress like ours. These machines come in varied quality and they’ll compress everything. Cheap China-made beds just do not recover the same way as ours.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">In this arena, Jered has done his homework. Hyphen mattresses can be compressed for several months and still completely recover. Ones sent to customers, though, have only been compressed for up to two weeks. He credits this recovery ability to the high-quality foam.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16986" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0445.jpg" alt="160217_HyphenFactory_0445" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0445.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160217_HyphenFactory_0445-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“People are always bringing up this notion of, ‘Can a premium mattress really come in a box,’” Jered explains. “It&#8217;s counter-intuitive, but the compression process makes the mattress wear better. All foam has an initial pop to it and then certain things will change. When you buy a mattress that&#8217;s uncompressed, that&#8217;s going to happen in your home over time and with use.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When you buy something like Hyphen, that change happens during compression. By the time you get it home, it changes very, very little.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>That&#8217;s what the testing has shown in comparison to industry standard and other averages from other beds. Ours wears much better post-purchase and we&#8217;ve designed the beds in terms of how they feel and everything else for after compression.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Any of the final testing we did in product development, we’d always compress the beds before they were tried so that it was a real product feel. It&#8217;s a true post-purchase experience.”</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">The Benefits of Being Second to Market</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16989" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/action-caurosel-4.jpg" alt="action-caurosel-4" width="750" height="439" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/action-caurosel-4.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/action-caurosel-4-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Like Jered said, Hyphen isn’t the first company to produce a bed-in-a-box. Hyphen isn’t even the first to produce a quality bed-in-the-box. What Hyphen is the first to do, though, is produce an all American made bed and a product that truly removes the middleman. This helps Hyphen to even further lower the price for a quality bed.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“We&#8217;re able to cut out layers and not just in comparison to retail. Most of our competitors don&#8217;t make their own mattress. We own our own factory and make our own mattress. The majority do not. The majority, despite talking about cutting out middlemen and saving you costs –– which they do to an extent, still outsource their manufacturer. We can bring an even greater level of value to the consumer by doing it ourselves, as well as a greater level of quality assurance.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">The proof is in the pudding here –– or the apple pie, or hotdog or whatever traditional food you first gravitate toward. You don’t have to reinvent the customer experience wheel to be successful when going direct to consumer. You just have to produce a great product and solve for the challenges facing this new era of commerce.</p>
<p class="p1">More and more wholesale brands will be going direct. <a href="https://www.internetretailer.com/commentary/2016/07/21/brands-selling-direct-what-does-unilevers-1-billion-bet-say">Unilever just bought Dollar Shave Club</a> for $1B –– one of the largest ever acquisitions of a direct to consumer brand by a traditional wholesaler. Turns out Procter and Gamble has been experimenting in the space as well with a laundry pod delivery service, Tide Wash Club. Cetaphil and Chapstick have both branched out beyond your local drug store and into independent websites all their own.</p>
<p class="p1">What does all of this mean for brands and retailers alike? Well, for one, that it’s imperative to be innovative  and provide convenience as a shopping service in order to win hearts and wallets today. It also means that the pricing race to the bottom is over. This is a pricing fairly game where intelligently cutting costs while providing quality will make you the winner.</p>
<p class="p1">Manufacturing ingenuity and technology is the solution. And you don’t have to be first to market, either. You just have to be bold enough to invest.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="750" height="385" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M5VXQW4ZLG-1.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M5VXQW4ZLG-1.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M5VXQW4ZLG-1-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p class="p1">Putting in place an effective ecommerce shipping strategy is one of the most significant things you can do to grow your business online. While many folks start out in ecommerce by taking a simplistic approach to shipping –– like offering free shipping across the board or showing unmodified UPS or USPS rates –– the most successful ecommerce merchants use an ecommerce shipping strategy to differentiate themselves from their competition.</p>
<p class="p1">While it can be a powerful point of differentiation, it’s also important to make sure that you as a company can actually act on your strategy. This requires coordination between multiple teams within your company, going all the way from your marketing team to your fulfillment team and several others in between. Establishing an ecommerce shipping strategy lets you ensure that everyone involved in this pipeline knows what’s going on and what their part in the process is.</p>
<h2>Assemble the Team</h2>
<p><img class="wp-image-16268" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/84GOP2OAKR.jpg" alt="Startup Stock Photos" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/84GOP2OAKR.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/84GOP2OAKR-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Identifying the right people to help make this decision for your business is the first step in this process. This requires that you bring into the conversation the right stakeholders within your organization.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Marketing Teams</strong> need to communicate shipping to your customers and may want to use shipping promotions like free or flat rate shipping to bring people to your site or increase order value.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Web Design or Development Teams</strong> need to be able to make sure that the right shipping options are being shown to customers at the right time and that these are clear to customers.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Fulfillment Teams</strong> need to be able to ensure that orders are being picked, packed and shipped accurately and on time every time and that no matter what option the customer chooses, their team can handle that choice.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Customer Service Teams</strong> need to know how your approach to shipping will affect customers at each stage in the customer lifecycle so they can answer questions appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Define Your Goals</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16260" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/XXTEK7APLA.jpg" alt="XXTEK7APLA" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/XXTEK7APLA.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/XXTEK7APLA-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Once you’ve identified the key teams in your company who will need to be involved in establishing your strategy, you need to define what you want to accomplish with your ecommerce shipping strategy. There are many areas of focus here including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Increase Conversions</strong> by offering the kinds of shipping options and rates your customers are expecting. The shipping options and rates you offer can have a massive impact on your conversion rate.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Increase Average Order Value</strong> by offering promotions that encourage folks to buy more. These may include things like free shipping thresholds, free expedited shipping at a certain price point, or flat rate shipping on specific high-profit items.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Expand Your Market</strong> by offering shipping to new areas or to folks who couldn’t previously access your products. Offering international shipping or alternate shipping options like in-store pickup or local delivery can help extend your reach.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Decrease Your Costs</strong> by making changes to your fulfillment process and the shipping services you’re offering. Major carriers like UPS and FedEx offer alternate shipping services like UPS SurePost and FedEx Smart Post that can help cut costs while ensuring a high level of service.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Improve Operational Efficiency</strong> by making sure that your fulfillment teams have the information they need to make better decisions about how to pick, pack and ship orders. This may include things like purchasing new package types, using new services like ShipStation or walking through your fulfillment process to make sure there are no unnecessary manual steps that could be eliminated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Identify the Options</h2>

<p class="p1">Once you’ve identified the right team and goals for your business it’s time to get down to the work of choosing a strategy that is going to work for your team to accomplish the goals you’ve set.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ll identify a number of available strategies here with the pros and cons for each. None of these are exclusive of one another and most successful business will implement several of these options to form a complete strategy for your unique scenario.</p>
<h3>Free Shipping</h3>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16261" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/5JPOSBQS6T-1.jpg" alt="5JPOSBQS6T (1)" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/5JPOSBQS6T-1.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/5JPOSBQS6T-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Free shipping may seem like the simplest strategy and it’s grown massively in popularity since Amazon introduced Free Shipping for orders over $25. The advantages of Free Shipping are that it’s easy to explain to customers, it responds to customer expectations and it has a positive effect on conversion rates for customers who make it to your checkout funnel.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, free shipping may be free to your customers –– but not to you. You’ll still need to pay the carrier and you’ll have to make sure you’re making enough on each order to cover the associated shipping costs. This is why you’ll see that most companies (Amazon included) only offer free shipping over a certain price point and only on specific products.</p>
<p class="p1">If you choose to offer free shipping, it’s vitally important to understand its impact on your bottom line. Even if you’re making more sales, if you’re losing money on each one it’s of no benefit to your bottom line.</p>
<p class="p1">The most effective approach to free shipping is to only offer it for orders where you know you’re making enough on the sale to cover shipping and still make a profit. This means setting a free shipping order subtotal threshold that makes sense for your business and, maybe, excluding products that are too heavy or bulky for you to offer free shipping on.</p>
<h3>Flat Rate &amp; Table Rate Shipping</h3>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16266" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WP1KHDXGOY-1.jpg" alt="WP1KHDXGOY (1)" width="750" height="501" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WP1KHDXGOY-1.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WP1KHDXGOY-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">One extremely effective way to avoid some of the challenges of Free Shipping is to go the flat rate or table-rate route. Flat rate shipping is something like $10 shipping regardless of order value (see, for example, Overstock.com who charge $2.95 to most locations in the United States).</p>
<p class="p1">Table-rate shipping is a bit more complex, but doesn’t have to be much more so. Customers in certain regions, like the United Kingdom, prefer table-rate shipping versus being charged a live rate. For example, a merchant with a warehouse in London might charge customers near the city a certain amount, say £5 per order, with rates going up to £10, £15, etc. as you get further away from the fulfillment center.</p>
<p class="p1">You might also charge based on the order subtotal ($10 for orders up to $50 in value, $5 for orders up to $100, and free for orders over $100). Alternately, you might charge a different rate for certain groups of products or set rates based on the order weight.</p>
<h3>Live Rates from a Carrier</h3>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16265" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MZX63HGMBK.jpg" alt="MZX63HGMBK" width="750" height="502" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MZX63HGMBK.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MZX63HGMBK-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">If the most important factor for you is to offer the best possible rate while still covering your costs, getting live rates in real-time directly from a carrier like UPS, FedEx or DHL may be the best way to go.</p>
<p class="p1">While it’s harder to use this approach as a promotional tool (the rates may vary significantly depending on what the customer orders and the distance from your warehouses to the customer), you can ensure that you’re offering the cheapest possible shipping option by charging your customer exactly what you’ll be charged by the carrier.</p>
<p class="p1">Especially if you’re in a market where many of your competitors are offering live rates, it may be important to do so. This means that for lightweight orders or customers located near your warehouses, you can often offer significantly cheaper shipping than your competition while still making sure your costs are covered.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, it doesn’t have to be as simple as plugging into a carrier like UPS and showing exactly what UPS returns for each order. You can add a surcharge if you want the shipping charge to cover things like packaging and your cost of fulfillment. You can also discount the rate returned to be that much more competitive over others in your market.</p>
<h3>Mixed &amp; Alternate Options</h3>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16264" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/I1GV6WICCT-1.jpg" alt="I1GV6WICCT (1)" width="750" height="499" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/I1GV6WICCT-1.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/I1GV6WICCT-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">While these three options are the most popular and frequently used, thinking outside the box and mixing and matching these approaches can be extremely effective. This allows you to balance your revenue needs with promotional opportunities.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, offering free standard shipping (with no delivery commitment or a range commitment like 5-10 business days for delivery) alongside other options like Expedited shipping (for example, 3-5 day delivery at a table rate based on order value) and live rate options for Second Day and Overnight delivery.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition to these most popular approaches, offering additional, less orthodox options can help you stand out from the crowd. For example, free in-store pickup can drive customers to your retail locations (resulting in additional traffic and sales at your brick and mortar locations). If you’re selling particularly large or heavy items, offering LTL freight delivery on your website can help keep costs down while making it easier for customers to place larger orders online.</p>
<h2>Making the Leap: Implementation &amp; Analysis</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16262" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/0363D3DBA4.jpg" alt="0363D3DBA4" width="750" height="563" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/0363D3DBA4.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/0363D3DBA4-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">With the right team in place, your goals clearly defined, and your approach or approaches chosen, it’s time to implement your ecommerce shipping strategy. Each team member or team leader should be clear on their responsibilities. You don’t have to do everything all at once but everyone should be clear on their responsibilities each step of the way.</p>
<p class="p1">Your marketing team should be ready to communicate your new approach to your customers and potential customers, the web design or development team should get your site set up to offer these new options, your fulfillment team should be ready to make use of your new options and know how to handle each option the customer chooses, and your customer service team should be educated in the benefits of each option you’re now going to be offering your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Once your new approach is live, make it the responsibility of each team to report on how well things are going for them. Often, a new approach will take some time to bed down so if you have the evidence to back up your changes be prepared to stick with it and make some adjustments as you go.</p>
<h2>The Shipping Strategy That&#8217;s Right for You</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16259" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/57E1DEA075.jpg" alt="57E1DEA075" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/57E1DEA075.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/57E1DEA075-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Making changes to your ecommerce shipping strategy can help ensure your business’ success by improving your conversion rate, increasing your average order value, and increasing sales of more profitable products, all while making sure that you’re aware of exactly how much you’re going to be making (if you want to pad your profits) or losing (if you’re prepared to give away some revenue to be more competitive) on shipping.</p>
<p class="p1">If you truly want to run a successful online business it’ll be worth your while to invest some time into determining and executing a purposeful ecommerce shipping strategy.</p>

Each of these brands function both as B2C and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/b2b-ecommerce-solution/">B2B businesses</a> and have exploded in growth over the last couple years. Operationalizing wholesale activities was a primary cause for the revenue scale.</p>
<p class="p1">Despite these similarities, each of these brands has a unique story to tell about how it found success through working with leading retailers. Son of a Sailor sells <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/jewelry">handmade jewelry and other accessories</a> –– and has wholesale partnerships with the likes of Anthropologie and West Elm. Fortress of Inca sources internationally and sustainably for fabrics brought in from Peru to craft shoes –– and has wholesale partnerships with the likes of Free People and the Sundance Catalog. And Primal Pit Paste exists in the health and beauty realm, specifically in the organic and all-natural space –– and has wholesale partnerships with Whole Foods and HEB.</p>

<p class="p1">How did these three brands earn their spots in the big brand spotlight? Well, a couple of ways. Attending events was a unanimous must-do for all the brands, a way to get their items in front of prospective bigger brand buyers. But so, too, was having their own independent website –– and using all the customizations possible to pull in organic traffic and properly serve both a B2B and B2C market.</p>
<p class="p1">Read through the interviews below to see how each brand forged their relationships, how they manage the process and which came first: revenue or profit.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-16086 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-1.40.37-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-09 at 1.40.37 PM" width="650" height="366" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-1.40.37-PM.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-1.40.37-PM-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<h3>Let’s start by talking about which big brand stores your products are in and how you forged those relationships?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Evan Streusand, founder of <a href="http://www.fortressofinca.com/">Fortress of Inca</a></strong></em>: In the last year we have worked with Free People, Anthropologie, the Sundance Catalog and The J. Peterman Catalog. Relationships with these retailers have been built in a number of ways, including trade shows, outreach and then visits to their headquarters. We’ve also been connected through some mutual industry connections.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Jessica Tata, co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://sonofasailor.co/">Son of a Sailor</a></strong></em>: We have been thrilled to work with Anthropologie, Free People, The Conran Shop, West Elm, The Land of Nod and CB2. As we began our business, we encountered a couple of big brand stores that were attending craft shows and scouring Etsy. As we’ve grown, we have gained much more exposure to larger brands through trade shows and networking events. We are also seeing a lot of connectivity through storytelling: some of the stores and websites that have featured our story in a longer-form format have generated some very meaningful relationships.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Amy Cazin, owner and CEO of <a href="http://primalpitpaste.com/">Primal Pit Paste</a></strong></em>: While the majority of our business remains B2C, we have our products in just under 400 small to mid-size stores, as well as Whole Foods regional and global and HEB. We have several other medium and big box stores scheduled to launch this year. Forging relationships with our wholesale customers was an organic growth opportunity. Companies reached out to us through our online presence requesting wholesale pricing. As a result, we hired a wholesale team to support them and engaged brokers this past year.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<h3>What are some of your biggest challenges in maintaining both a B2C as well as wholesale operations?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Streusand, Fortress of Inca</strong></em>: It’s essentially like running two different businesses, so having the resources to focus on each is difficult at times. Money that we spend to attend wholesale trade shows or to go on sales trips takes away from money that we could spend to develop our online business, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">It’s like running 2 businesses. Having the resources to focus on each is difficult at times.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Tata, Son of a Sailor</strong></em>: As Evan mentioned, it is running two separate businesses that require attention in two unique ways. For us, time has always been our most precious resource. As we have navigated the growth of our business, we decided to invest our time heavily in the things that were gaining momentum organically. Our wholesale business blossomed and we focused heavily in maintaining that side of our company and fostering continued sustainable growth. Riding momentum that already existed and keeping it going is much easier than generating activity from nothing. Growing our B2C, specifically online, didn’t happen quite as naturally. So last year we really turned our attention to that part of our business in order to make sure it didn’t get left behind. But it is a struggle to balance the energy that goes into each area of your business, because there are only so many hours in the day!</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Our wholesale business blossomed and we focused heavily in maintaining that side of our company.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Cazin, Primal Pit Paste</strong></em>: Our biggest challenge to support B2C and wholesale operations was the short timeline we had to develop a multi-channel process to support infrastructure, understand our cost structures and ensure we had the tools in place to support our brokers and drive profitable sales. It was a significant challenge to slow our on-boarding process during that phase to make sure the individual requirements and nuances of each business were well understood. Buyers who want your product do not want to stand in line to get it. We are very fortunate to be able to have account managers capable of developing strong relationships quickly and that to effectively communicate the value of our implementation timelines.</p>

<h3>What are some organizational methods you use to keep everything on track?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Tata, Son of a Sailor</strong></em>: Best question ever! I am an organization enthusiast, so I’m always looking for the best method to keep things in check! We really appreciate online tools that we use in our day-to-day business, like Asana (for task and project management) and Capsule (for contact management) but we also rely on some analog methods, as well. I’m also killer with a label-maker and Ikea and The Container Store are my sanctuaries.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<h3>Alright, time for a chicken or egg question, which came first: profitable revenue or wholesale partnerships?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Streusand, Fortress of Inca</strong></em>: For us, it was wholesale partnerships. Wholesale increases our volume with our factories, which drives down our production costs. It also drives brand awareness, which leads to an increase in online sales.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Wholesale increases our volume with our factories, which drives down our production costs.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Tata, Son of a Sailor</strong></em>: Our business began sort of accidentally, with a great demand for products that we were making as a hobby. We began with veritably no overhead, and the steady and fast-paced increase in sales grew our business as if we were riding a wave. As we began incurring the costs that come with running a business, we already had the sales driving our decisions. So we were lucky to begin our business seeing profit from the onset. After the first couple of years, our wholesale partnerships became key to continuing to see profit as our expenses continued to grow.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Our wholesale partnerships became key to continuing to see profit as our expenses grew.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Cazin, Primal Pit Paste</strong></em>: Profitable revenue. Our ecommerce business drove our wholesale business. Many of our buyers started with us as customers. Others saw our marketing and PR campaigns and followed bloggers that are rabid fans of our products. They reached out to learn more about us and our product line.</p>
<p class="p1">Implementation of a wholesale strategy is expensive. Not only are you required to produce more, you are required to hold a larger inventory on a daily basis where forecasting is off from buyers. Without profits to fund the operations, you end up taking on debt, factoring or giving away equity to finance your wholesale channel. Our goal is to continue to own 100% of our company. So, profits have a very big impact on our wholesale strategy.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<h3>How does your pricing model work with wholesale? Is there a strategy you’d recommend to maintain margins?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Streusand, Fortress of Inca</strong></em>: We try to at least double our production cost and use that number as our wholesale price. Of course there are exceptions where we feel we either need to cap the wholesale price of a product at a specific amount and sometimes not make double, or other times when we feel we can increase our wholesale price to more than double production costs because we feel the product can be sold for more.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We try to at least double our production cost and use that number as our wholesale price.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Tata, Son of a Sailor</strong></em>: We work with a formula that accounts for raw materials, labor, marketing, packaging and profit, giving us a target number for pricing. We will adjust our actual pricing upwards if the market allows for higher prices, but we try not to ever go below this number. From the very start of Son of a Sailor, it has been very important to us for our products to be attainable –– good design shouldn’t break the bank. Even as some of our items grow in price as we use finer materials and more intricate design, we strive to create a range that doesn’t abandon the customer who wants to spend $20 on a keychain or $40 on a necklace. Now, our greatest challenge is to also support our family of employees, and ourselves, in a way that is sustainable. Austin isn’t getting any cheaper! It’s a delicate dance balancing affordability, quality, expenses and profit in the handmade business.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Cazin, Primal Pit Paste</strong></em>: The pricing models in wholesale vary significantly. With small to mid-size wholesale customers, the terms are pretty straight forward and the cost models are moderately easy to manage and control. However, signing on with big box is a completely different ball game. Each big box customer has its own processes and requirements – one-offs are expensive to implement, especially when you take on your first few customers. You have to know up front that the end-to-end cost structures are subject to change. The changes eat into your margins. You must know what you are signing up for and account for future requirements. <span class="s1"> </span></p>

<h3>Are wholesale operation truly profitable or is a brand awareness play?</h3>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Streusand, Fortress of Inca</strong></em>: Our wholesale side is definitely profitable and has really been the key to growing our business. It definitely helps with brand awareness as well.</p>

<p class="p1"><em><strong>Tata, Son of a Sailor</strong></em>: If you are pricing your items properly, wholesale is truly profitable. There are tools to help streamline the work to preserve that profit margin, like minimum item quantities and order times, properly gauged lead times on production, etc. We’re trying to find and utilize as many of these tools as we can! A wholesale business can not only grow brand awareness (sometimes like wildfire) but it is also a foundation upon which you can build amazing customer relationships with stores that will be a part of the landscape of your business for a long time. Our first wholesale account was with a store called Amelia Presents out of Oxford, Mississippi, and we work with her to this day. We’ve seen a collaboration between our two businesses on the pages of Real Simple magazine, we’ve sold great volumes of product through her store and we have lots of plans for our businesses to grow together in the future. So, while we are focusing increasingly on reaching out to individual customers and further developing our B2C arm, wholesale is a vital and important part of our business.</p>

<p class="p1"><em><strong>Cazin, Primal Pit Paste</strong></em>: That depends completely on the wholesale customer. There are wholesale customers that you will break even with and wholesale customer who you will lose money on. If you chose to onboard well-known big box brands to get more eyes on your product at a loss, you need to have the costs allocated as part of your marketing budget. This is where it makes sense to rationalize the SKUs you place in big box and drive sales to an ecommerce site for a broader selection of more profitable products.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="750" height="383" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WP1KHDXGOY.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WP1KHDXGOY.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/WP1KHDXGOY-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p class="p1">From the hundreds of surveys, polls, and studies published each year on ecommerce, one thing is clear: offering the right shipping rates and options to your customers is crucial to your success as a retailer.</p>
<p class="p1">Getting this piece right can make the difference between losing a customer if you charge too much and losing your shirt if you charge too little. And it&#8217;s not just cost that makes a difference. Offering the right shipping options to your customers at the right times plays a critical role in reducing cart abandonment and increasing revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>Offering the right shipping options at the right times plays a critical role in increasing revenue.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Offering+the+right+shipping+options+at+the+right+times+plays+a+critical+role+in+increasing+revenue.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/take-control-of-your-shipping-increase-conversions-cover-costs-and-delight-customers/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">Taking full control of your shipping means that you can offer the lowest shipping rates possible, still cover your costs, and offer the options your customers want. Here’s how to properly think through what you can offer, including when and why, to maximize sales and decrease costs.</p>
<h2>What to Consider</h2>
<p class="p1">The most important factors to consider when taking control of your shipping can be broken down into three areas:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product size and weight:</strong> What&#8217;s the difference in size and weight from your smallest, lightest SKUs to your largest, heaviest SKUs?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Shipping destinations:</strong> Where are you shipping to –– domestic or international?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Shipping options:</strong> What are the best shipping services or carriers for your unique needs?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Product Size and Weight</h2>
<p class="p1">The first of these, product size and weight, is often the easiest to get your head around and has the biggest impact on the approach you take. If your products are relatively uniform, then going with a per-item, zone-based approach, where the shipping price varies by your customer&#8217;s location and not by product size or weight, can work well. This is also a great place to build easy to understand promotions like $10 shipping per order, $5 shipping per item or even free shipping over $50.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>Focus on making sure your products have accurate weights and dimensions.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Focus+on+making+sure+your+products+have+accurate+weights+and+dimensions.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/take-control-of-your-shipping-increase-conversions-cover-costs-and-delight-customers/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">For many retailers, however, sizes and weights vary widely among their product set. If you&#8217;re one of these, getting rates directly from a carrier like UPS, DHL, Australia Post or others can be a great way to ensure the rates you&#8217;re offering to your customers are the best possible rates. The important thing to focus on here is making sure your products have accurate weights and dimensions so that the rate you get back from a carrier is as accurate as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">Break your products into groups and focus on getting product weights and dimensions for the heaviest or largest 20% and smallest or lightest 20%. This will have the biggest effect on your shipping rates and offer the best return on investment.</p>
<h2>Shipping Destinations</h2>
<p class="p1">The second consideration, shipping destinations, can be just as crucial as product dimensions and weight. Again, in a simpler scenario like domestic shipping, a flat-rate or free shipping option can work well here. Alternately, step it up a bit and set rates based on zones. For example, if you&#8217;re located in New York, offer a cheaper rate for the mid-Atlantic region and increase the rate as you radiate out from there.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>Shipping internationally normally necessitates getting a rate straight from a carrier.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Shipping+internationally+normally+necessitates+getting+a+rate+straight+from+a+carrier.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/take-control-of-your-shipping-increase-conversions-cover-costs-and-delight-customers/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">Shipping internationally normally necessitates getting a rate straight from a carrier like the USPS, DHL or others. Rates can vary significantly even in neighboring countries and it&#8217;s difficult to build your own rates for these scenarios.</p>
<h2>Shipping Options</h2>
<p class="p1">Finally, managing the shipping options that you offer gives you the chance to delight customers and keep costs in check. Look beyond the big-name carriers and you&#8217;ll find a world of opportunity to offer same day delivery, next day delivery or timely and cost-effective delivery for even the largest items.</p>
<p class="p1">In major cities, you&#8217;ll often find local delivery and courier companies that will deliver more quickly to your customers than the big carriers at very competitive rates. If you&#8217;re shipping especially large items or do a lot of large B2B shipments, using an LTL (Less Than Truckload) freight carrier becomes a necessity.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>When looking at alternate delivery options, make sure you control when and where it&#8217;s shown.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=When+looking+at+alternate+delivery+options%2C+make+sure+you+control+when+and+where+it%27s+shown.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/take-control-of-your-shipping-increase-conversions-cover-costs-and-delight-customers/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">Local couriers often don&#8217;t offer a way to fetch rates in real time for shipments, but it can be worth your while to build up a table of rates based on number of items or weight in order to offer these options to your customers. LTL freight carriers do often allow real-time rating, so connecting one of these to your store can be quick and easy. Other options like free in-store pickup are also great additions to your stable of options, and have a myriad of additional benefits.</p>
<p class="p1">The important thing when looking at any alternate delivery option is to make sure that you control when and where it&#8217;s shown. If you&#8217;re based in Sydney, you probably don&#8217;t want to show your local delivery courier as an option for a customer from Paris. The same can be said for showing an LTL freight carrier as an option for someone who orders a single t-shirt.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="p1">Taking control of your shipping ensures that you aren&#8217;t leaving money on the table or risking your success by charging too little. Even small changes here can pay enormous dividends in cart conversion, controlling shipping costs, and delighting customers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="750" height="383" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1CFC9715A4.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1CFC9715A4.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1CFC9715A4-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p class="p1">Freight management may seem like a straightforward process of moving packages from point A to point B in theory, but in practice, it can be a highly involved operation that requires a great deal of business strategy on behalf of retailers. The procedure is a key interaction point with consumers, and how goods go from warehouse to customers’ doorsteps has a direct impact on brand perception. Over time, a company’s freight management strategy can generate lifetime customer loyalty, or conversely, cause disdain and negative consumer perception of your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>Online shopping is expected to breach $327B this year, accounting for 9% of all retail sales.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Online+shopping+is+expected+to+breach+%24327B+this+year%2C+accounting+for+9%25+of+all+retail+sales.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/determine-cost-effective-freight-management-strategy-unique-brand-needs/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">According to Forrester, online shopping is expected to breach $327 billion this year, accounting for 9% of all retail sales. But the sale is just the first step in the important process of getting the right product to the right customer at the right time. Just like a company’s website or storefront, shipping is a key customer touchpoint –– and time efficiency matters.</p>
<p class="p1">To develop a quality freight management strategy, begin by asking yourself or your shipping strategist the following questions. Think through exactly how your end-customer experience should be, how far you can stretch your margins and if you can begin to count free shipping fees as a marketing expense to garner customer loyalty and increase your bottom line in the long run.</p>
<h2>What is my ideal brand experience?</h2>
<p class="p1">The way in which packages arrive at shoppers’ doorsteps says a great deal about how brands feel about their customers. For example, a damaged box that shows up three days late isn’t going to send a great message to shoppers in regards to your customer service. And, these days, customer service and subsequent customer perception can make or break your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">A trackable package, however, that arrives on time and perhaps even requires a signature at the door sends a message of quality and professionalism to customers –– increasing their trust in your brand and therefore the likelihood they will shop with you again.</p>
<p class="p1">Because a shipment is one of the only physical touchpoints an ecommerce brand has with its customers, timeliness and packaging material or design are factors that all brands should be taking the time to explore. Sure, you already got them to convert, but if you want them to continue purchasing from your brand, if you want to increase their customer lifetime value, then you have to nail the shipping –– both aesthetically and time-consciously.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>61% of online shoppers say premium packaging makes a brand seem more upscale.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=61%25+of+online+shoppers+say+premium+packaging+makes+a+brand+seem+more+upscale.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/determine-cost-effective-freight-management-strategy-unique-brand-needs/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">Of course, not all brands can afford a luxury shipping experience, and frankly not all customers demand premium delivery. It’s important to instead align freight decisions with an intended brand experience. High-end brands may want to invest in better packaging processes. Even just the packaging material can matter: <a href="http://www.dotcomdist.com/Unwrapping-the-Customer-Experience%22%20rel=%22nofollow%22">61% of online shoppers</a> say premium packaging makes a brand seem more upscale. For retailers with a more general target audience, invest in branded packaging or even just branded packaging notes encouraging users to share their experience of your product with the world. This adds a personal touch to the package without needing to increase expenses. Even a handwritten note can suffice here.</p>
<p class="p1">When companies begin to understand their customer’s desires and expectations, they can begin to make more informed freight decisions that meet those demands.</p>
<h2>How much is my average order value (AOV) for shipping?</h2>
<p class="p1">The AOV of packages is another metric brands can use to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">define their shipping strategies</a>. The basic rule to follow is:</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>As AOV increases, investments in shipping methods should increase, too.</em></p>
<p class="p1">For instance, the AOV for office supplies like pens and pencils is typically under $100. As such, shoppers are not likely to be concerned with being able to track their package, or if their package is delivered without needing a signature. On the other hand, consumers ordering pricey electronics (with AOVs in the thousands) expect their goods to arrive in pristine condition. The more expensive the purchase or the value of the purchase, the more time you need to spend with setting up a strategic freight shipping strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>As AOV increases, brands should invest in greater insurance measures.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=As+AOV+increases%2C+brands+should+invest+in+greater+insurance+measures.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/determine-cost-effective-freight-management-strategy-unique-brand-needs/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">As AOV increases, brands should invest in greater insurance measures. This can include careful handling procedures or sturdier boxes. Additions like these give consumers peace of mind that their products are safe and makes them feel that their money is well spent.</p>
<h2>Can I afford to offer free shipping?</h2>
<p class="p1">Free shipping is a powerful tool for online retailers. In fact, <a href="https://selz.com/blog/40-online-shopping-ecommerce-statistics-know/">47% of all online orders</a> now include free shipping and studies show shoppers spend 30% more with companies offering free shipping. But getting free shipping up and running can a be a difficult, margin-cutting task.</p>
<p class="p1">Many scaling brands simply cannot afford to offer free shipping on every order, but that doesn’t mean you should forgo free shipping altogether. Promotions can be used as a powerful marketing tool. For example, a free shipping threshold can be the final conversion persuasion point on high-ticket items and can increase your overall AOV. The tool can complement a wide variety of marketing endeavors, like the promotion of a newsletter (free shipping upon subscription) or the growth of sales during holiday seasons.</p>
<p class="p1">
<hr />
<p><em>Shoppers spend 30% more with companies offering free shipping.</em><br /><a href='https://twitter.com/share?text=Shoppers+spend+30%25+more+with+companies+offering+free+shipping.&#038;via=BigCommerce&#038;related=BigCommerce&#038;url=https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/determine-cost-effective-freight-management-strategy-unique-brand-needs/' target='_blank'>Click To Tweet</a></p>
<hr />
<p class="p1">No matter how it’s used, free shipping should always benefit a brand’s bottom line. Like any good marketing strategy, measure, test and analyze your free shipping offering to ensure it is producing ROI. <a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/proven-a-b-testing-steps/">A/B testing </a>your offerings on your site is a good way to do this. Also, pay close attention to critical factors like customer location and the size and weight of products, as these can alter when free shipping is a logical option. Free shipping involves many business verticals from logistics to marketing, but when done correctly it can drive sales, which in turn generates greater revenue.</p>
<h2>Putting it All Together</h2>
<p class="p1">Freight management is a key aspect in how shipments arrive at shopper’s home. Once you have determined exactly how your shipping experience should be for your end-customer, it’s time to find a freight management partner to help you accomplish those goals. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Ensure consistency on charges</strong>: While there are many variables that go into determining the cost of shipping, it is very important to analyze freight costs to make sure there is a level of consistency. Some cost components are going to always vary geographically, but others should remain constant. It is very important to lock-in the rates at time of contract with freight providers. For example, the price invoiced for container #53 should be the same as container #1, regardless of the time frame between shipments. This requires excellent communication skills on the business’s part. Set firm boundaries. Any unexpected change in fees should have a 30 to 60 day alert period –– otherwise be sure to contractually agree that you can break the contract terms in the case this does not occur. Frequently changing fees cut into your bottom line at one of the most critical intersections of your operation.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Be location aware</strong>: When thinking about business opportunities and expansion, keep your location in mind and check in with freight management companies to talk about negotiated rates for various warehouse locations. You can use an integration like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shipperhq/">ShipperHQ </a>to help you show real-time shipping rates to customers based on your negotiated rates, so there are no surprise fees for your customers either.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Communication is key</strong>: Ensure all details concerning the freight are given to the freight management services provider, as they will have a chance to give you a service to better match the needs you have, connecting you with the right carrier to handle any of the specific shipping conditions you may have. Use freight management consultation and analysis services, as well, to see where you could be cutting costs –– and then negotiate. Many transportation management services providers can give you a solution that best matches what you need in order to reach your goals and necessary margins. Going into the partnership with clear goals, expectations and boundaries upfront yields great long term and sustainable bottom line savings.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Air vs. ocean for international projects</strong>: For a successful international project, it is important to partner with a freight forwarder that can provide both air and ocean freight services. Regardless of how well you plan your freight, anything can go wrong. Inevitably, air shipments will need to be implemented for that key component that failed at startup or that was “misplaced” in transit. It always happens. Freight providers can typically schedule a pallet load air shipment anywhere in the world within five days at very reasonable rates. Ask about it.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Tracking both domestically and internationally</strong>: Something we take for granted in domestic freight is the ability to track shipments door to door. It is an absolute must to always know, or at least have the ability to quickly determine, where your freight is at any moment. Mandate that your freight partners have the ability to provide real time status of all freight with a simple phone call or via a few mouse clicks. This is vital for international projects where delays in port can quickly add up to big dollars, as the industry saw in 2015.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Quality assurance</strong>: Whenever you work with a professional transportation management 3PL, they will look after your interests. After all, you as a client are the lifeblood of their company. A good services provider will align themselves with other transportation companies to provide the best service they can in the long run, but you need to be able to ask them a few questions to check and understand their quality control procedures. You need to know whether they have a quality assurance program, the condition of their business practice and its maintenance, whether they have control checks in case of anomalous events and contingencies to ensure your freight arrives on time and safe and more. A disaster recovery plan should also be a part of the way they operate to ensure all bases are covered when you work with them.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Do your due diligence</strong>: Ask for client-like-me references and then actually call those brands. Ask about their experience with the company, what they would have done differently if they could go back and use the power of knowledge and reference to find the best partner for your company and to negotiate the best rates for your packaging and shipping needs.</li>
