				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="2000" height="920" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-hero.png" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-hero.png 2000w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-hero-300x138.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-hero-750x345.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p class="p1">Generating demand is among the most important aspects of selling online, and the most successful brands are also those which optimize for sales across a variety of touchpoints.</p>
<p class="p1">Whether it be through email campaigns, advertising or content marketing, brands must find a way to entice shoppers to buy – with their brand and at that moment – more so than ever before.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, we’re excited to share a new way BigCommerce merchants can make marketing campaigns even more successful — <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/buy-button/">the BigCommerce Buy Button</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Why We Built a Buy Button</h2>
<p class="p1">In 2015, there were a slew of announcements about Buy Buttons, which press wrote about as the next evolution of &#8216;social commerce.&#8217;</p>
<p class="p1">Fast forward 2 years and Buy Buttons haven&#8217;t yet taken off on social media, and brands continue to look for new, creative ways to sell products off-site –– making marketing campaigns and content more shoppable with less friction in the purchase process.</p>
<p class="p1">In those two years, it became clear that there was a need for a consolidated Buy Button brands themselves could own and launch. Giving brands the power, allows them to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Execute on campaigns more quickly, through both owned and third-party channels</li>
<li class="p1">Standardized reporting on Buy Button success across their company</li>
<li class="p1">Allow for various marketing and sales channel owners to use and launch buy buttons as needed</li>
<li class="p1">Customize Buy Button purchasing funnel flows as necessary for the campaign and in line with individual brand standards</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This follows the same logic as any emerging industry. At first, there are a disparate amount of options which later conglomerate into only a few, the most useful winning the lion’s share.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to Buy Buttons, that market is still relatively untapped –– forcing store owners and online marketers to use a variety of buttons across a variety of platforms with mixed reporting and analytics data to prove value.</p>
<p class="p1">Our engineers set out to fix that.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Install the BigCommerce Buy Button</h3></p>
<p class="p1">With a single click, BigCommerce customers can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/buy-buttons/">begin using the Buy Button right now</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">A Buy Button Built for Customization and Analytics</h2>
<p class="p1">Today, BigCommerce’s Buy Button officially launches within Channel Manager. Already, more than 400 online stores have installed the button and begun using it. We’ve interviewed many of them, worked through bugs and are now confident that the BigCommerce Buy Button is ready for the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">From a user perspective, the flow to create a card, button, or link is very intuitive. Plus, I love all the options already built-in. Having those customizations already there is really important because a lot of other platforms that have options to embed iframes are cookie-cutter. The amount of options on BigCommerce’s Buy Buttons is what really caught my attention at first.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, having the option to put Google tracking analytics or UTMs on it is really important to me. Honestly, inputs like that just plain make sense –– otherwise you wouldn’t be able to track success.</p>
<p class="p1">– Kyle Glaser, Founder and CEO, <a href="http://store.parkway.tv/">Parkway.tv</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The BigCommerce Buy Buttons allow shoppers to buy individual products right from your blog, website, emails and more. Now, you can make mini shopping experiences outside of your BigCommerce store to sell on other websites, in emails, through ads and on your own site, as needed.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://demo.buybutton.store">Test it out for yourself</a>:</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 3px; margin-left: 2.5%;" src="https://demo.buybutton.store/" width="95%" height="800"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Learn More About the Buy Button</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Choose your variants, edit your text and drop in the card, button or link anywhere! <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Buy-Buttons-app">Learn more here</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">This button is unlike those you will find elsewhere on the web –– whether it be on social media, in an email platform or even on another ecommerce platform provider.</p>
<p class="p1">First and foremost, they allow you to choose how you want to link the button. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">A card</li>
<li class="p1">A button</li>
<li class="p1">A link</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21038" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="302" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2.png 1389w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2-300x142.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2-750x354.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">From there, you can choose to send those who click on the card, button or link either to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Checkout page</li>
<li class="p1">Shopping cart</li>
<li class="p1">Product page</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21039" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="302" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1.png 1391w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1-300x142.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1-750x354.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">For the card and button options, you can choose to open the page in a pop-up window, on a new tab or in the same tab. In addition, you can add a UTM source code to track the performance of your Buy Buttons in both your BigCommerce and Google Analytics.</p>
<p class="p1">In BigCommerce, it will show up here:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21031" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="365" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1.png 1179w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1-300x171.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1-750x428.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And then you can dive deeper into that campaign tab, here:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21032" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4.png" alt="" width="640" height="256" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4.png 1111w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4-300x120.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4-750x300.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of how your Buy Button campaign UTM would appear on the backend.</em></p>
<p class="p1">In addition, Buy Button conversion will soon appear in the store performance dashboard, and  will display orders that come from <em>direct-to-checkout</em> links (which you can choose as you set up your buy button).</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21033" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics.png" alt="" width="640" height="301" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics.png 1110w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-300x141.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-750x353.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">Advanced Buy Button Customization and Analytics</h2>
<p class="p1">Beyond the basic UTM tagging, button-type choice and UX flow, we’ve also built in advanced features to allow for further customization to match your brand and better sync with your Google Analytics for goal and conversion tracking.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at how quickly I was able to customize the button just by playing around with it.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksEotH9IoQY" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">The Google Analytics ID is where you will input your <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en">Google Tracking ID</a> to track traffic, clicks and conversion on the button. Here is how you find your tracking ID:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Sign in to <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/web/#home/">your Analytics account</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">Click <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6132368">Admin</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">Select an account from the menu in the ACCOUNT column.</li>
<li class="p1">Select a property from the menu in the PROPERTY column.</li>
<li class="p1">Under PROPERTY, click Tracking Info &gt; Tracking Code.
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977">tracking ID and property number</a> are displayed at the top of the page.</li>
<li class="p1">Information about tracking apps is displayed under Mobile app tracking &#8211; <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7373305">Using the SDK</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">The <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6086097">tracking-code snippet</a> for your website is displayed under Website tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">The Google Analytics ID on the BigCommerce Buy Button now saves between sessions on the same device, so you only have to input it once.</p>
<h3 class="p7">User-Level Access and Usage</h3>
<p class="p1">At first install, the Buy Button is only available for account owners to use. You can edit this and allow additional members of your team to create their own buttons, cards or links as needed.</p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Store-Owner?q=user+accounts&amp;l=en_US&amp;fs=Search&amp;pn=1">Store Owner</a> can create / delete users and grant permissions from <a href="https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/settings/users">Account Settings › Users</a> under Single-Click Apps.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Install the BigCommerce Buy Button</h3></p>
<p class="p1">With a single click, BigCommerce customers can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/buy-buttons/">begin using the Buy Button right now</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">Where and How to Use the BigCommerce Buy Button</h2>
<p class="p1">There are a variety of use cases for the BigCommerce Buy Button and a few best practices for each. The most common ways the 412 brands already using the button are implementing it are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Email campaigns</li>
<li class="p1">Blogs</li>
<li class="p1">Affiliates, Influencers and Press</li>
<li class="p1">AdRoll</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Here are exactly how to use the BigCommerce Buy Buttons in each use case above, and recommended best practices.</p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Buttons + Email Campaigns</h3>
<p class="p1">Because email providers vary on how they serve up iFrames, we do not recommend you use the Button or Card option in any of your emails. If you do, it is likely that many of your customers will not see the button, and instead will see a blank space.</p>
<p class="p1">This is true even if the button shows up and works well in preview. This isn’t an iFrame issue, it is a permissions issue on the side of the user in their email account.</p>
<p class="p1">That said, you can use the Buy Button link option in your email CTA to push people directly to product page, cart or checkout page. Many email management systems, like MailChimp, provide their own buttons that you can customize, so all you need to do is drop in the BigCommerce generated link, and you’ll achieve a streamlined customer checkout experience.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21040" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email.png" alt="" width="640" height="241" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email.png 1395w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email-300x113.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email-750x282.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Depending on the ultimate goal of your email campaign, you may want to use various customer flows.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Checkout:</strong> Send customers direct to checkout if you are pushing customers to buy a single product “Right Now.” If you are using urgency or scarcity to drive up conversion, this is a good quick-to-checkout option, think flash sales, holiday sales, or “Only a Few Left in Stock!”</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Cart:</strong> Send customers direct to the shopping cart if you are looking to increase AOV from a particular customer cohort. For instance, if you have a Free Shipping offer running on banners across your site for orders over $100, send an email campaign that links to cart –– showing customers they only need $20 more of product to hit the free shipping threshold. You can easily set this up in the <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Using-Discount-Rules">discount tab on your BigCommerce backend</a>.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product page:</strong> Send customers direct to product page if you are introducing a new product, want to show off social proof or trying to drive additional traffic to a product page. Note that you may lose customers along the journey to conversion by starting higher in the funnel with this option. That said, if the customers are relatively new to your brand, this is a good option.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Remember, the best performing email campaigns only have 1 or 2 CTAs. Use the link within a CTA button provided through your email provider to track performance on your Google and BigCommerce Analytics.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>What Sending 100 Million Emails Taught Me About What Doesn’t Work</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/email-marketing-engagement-tips/">Noah Kagan details what works –– and what doesn’t –– when it comes to email marketing engagement.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Button + Blog</h3>
<p class="p1">The publishing industry has long had trouble working to monetize their efforts in the new digital age. Similarly, ecommerce brands have struggled to focus on content marketing efforts that don’t equally show off their product and push people back to conversion.</p>
<p class="p1">The transition between on-site content and checkout is often fraught with difficulties (and a bunch of various touchpoints that lose customers along the way).</p>
<p class="p1">With the BigCommerce Buy Button, you can eliminate that on your own blog and focus more on content marketing to drive traffic and increase your search engine ranking.</p>
<p class="p1">For this tactic, you can use any of the Buy Button options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Button</li>
<li class="p1">Card</li>
<li class="p1">Link</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You may even want to use various versions.</p>
<p class="p1">Some brands have used the Button option to advertise mentioned products throughout and at the end of posts. Here’s an example from the <a href="https://www.dvestore.com/">DVE Store</a>:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21035" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example.png" alt="" width="640" height="1429" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example.png 1395w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example-300x670.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example-750x1675.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You can also use the linking option to link out to products exactly where they are mentioned in posts, allowing the reader to click-to-purchase and strengthening your domain with interlining.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>The Content Strategy to 3x Sales</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/content-marketing-ecommerce-traffic/">One BigCommerce customer walks you through exactly what he did to 3x growth through content marketing alone. </a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Buttons + Affiliates, Influencers or Press Linking</h3>
<p class="p1">Many online brands use affiliates, influencers or the press to grow online awareness and push new customers to the site. The most important part of this type of work is being able to track the number of click-throughs and conversion in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Compensate affiliates or influencers properly</li>
<li class="p1">Determine which outlets work best for the brand (and then invest more heavily in those areas)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is where the UTM source and Google Analytics ID can be especially helpful. By giving influencers, affiliates and interested press the link to a product with these tracking mechanisms in place, you can track success across both your BigCommerce and Google Analytics.</p>
<p class="p1">The link option is most recommended here, but customer journey flow you use again depends on your desired outcome and audience.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Direct-to-checkout:</strong> This option is most useful when working with affiliates and influencers who send you the most qualified, ready-to-checkout traffic.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Direct-to-cart:</strong> This option is most useful for affiliates and influencers who send higher-funnel customers potentially looking for a Free Shipping or Discount offer at cart level.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product page:</strong> This most useful for press gift guide round ups, where consumers are still top of funnel and new to your brand, wanting to get to know you and your product before adding to cart.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Buttons + AdRoll</h3>
<p class="p1">Because of the built-in tracking mechanisms and the tracking mechanisms you can install on your site on the BigCommerce backend, you can use the links within AdRoll campaigns and track performance across those campaigns.</p>
<h3 class="p7">What are AdRoll campaigns?</h3>
<p class="p1">AdRoll campaigns are ads placed across the web to drive customers back to your site. You can use them to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">target net new customers</li>
<li class="p1">retarget site visitors</li>
<li class="p1">retarget existing customers to drive up AOV and lifetime loyalty</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">To add the AdRoll pixel to your BigCommerce site (which will track performance of the ads), you can install it in either the Google Analytics box in the BigCommerce control panel or the Footer Scripts box on Stencil if you are using a Stencil theme.</p>

<p class="p1">Switching to a BigCommerce theme, my conversion rate immediately went up. Mobile time on site went up. Everything went up!</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Tyler Sullivan, Founder and CEO at BombTech Golf</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">In 2016, BigCommerce stacked hands on a bold mission: to empower retailers, developers and partners to build world class sites in a fraction of the time as other ecommerce platforms.</p>
<p class="p1">We wanted retailers to have a pool of modern, beautiful, fully responsive themes that would empower their brand, drive more sales and engage with shoppers &#8212; both today and tomorrow &#8212; in ways they previously couldn’t.</p>
<p class="p1">Our strong community of merchants, developers and partners stepped up and helped us build that theme platform.</p>
<p class="p1">In early 2016, we released an early access edition of this <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/new-themes/">new theme platform</a>. Then, throughout the year, we spent countless hours speaking with many of you to incorporate your feedback to build themes that were faster, stronger and more beautiful.</p>
<p class="p1">We poured through net promoter score studies, support inquiries and surveys to drastically improve the quality of our new themes and framework.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, through that feedback, we are proud to announce the full release of the new BigCommerce theme development platform and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">theme marketplace</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">We hope this new platform feels as much yours as it does ours.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s have a look at what’s new.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Theme Editor and Edit Theme Files</h2>
<p class="p1">We’ve eliminated the disadvantages of our old Style Editor.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ve removed the need to edit HTML/CSS for things like inserting credit card logos, social media icons, adjusting the size of your images, adjusting the number of featured/popular/new products, and more. You can now do all of this within your new Theme Editor, without needing to touch the code.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stencil-editor.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-19288" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stencil-editor.png" alt="stencil-editor" width="750" height="387" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stencil-editor.png 1439w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stencil-editor-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stencil-editor-750x387.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Click on the photo to see the full image.</em></p>
<p class="p1">For those not afraid to get their hands a little dirty in HTML and CSS, don’t worry! With our edit theme files capability, you can easily access the HTML and CSS code to fully customize your site and build upon already existing templates.</p>
<p class="p1">Regardless of how you choose to edit and customize your theme, you’ll be able to preview your new site on desktop, mobile, or tablet –– all from one screen.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Fully Responsive Themes for a Mobile World</h2>
<p class="p1">Merchants can no longer afford to have a non-responsive site. Here are just a few case studies.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Exxel Outdoors Sees 193% Increase in Mobile Revenue &amp; 272% Increase in Mobile Conversion Rate</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19499" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-kelty.png" alt="new-themes-mobile-kelty" width="400" height="743" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-kelty.png 400w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-kelty-300x557.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://kelty.com/">Kelty </a>is one of several Exxel Outdoors brands.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">We want to make sure that someone on our site is having a great experience no matter what device they’re on.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Cory Barnes, Digital Marketing Manager for Exxel Outdoors</div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://exxel.com/">Exxel Outdoors</a> migrated 10 sites from an ASP.net framework to BigCommerce specifically for a mobile-responsive experience. It was clear their audience was mobile-driven, and traffic was high from mobile devices. Mobile conversions, though, remained incredibly low.</p>
<p class="p1">Once Exxel Outdoors launched all 10 sites, including Kelty and Sierra Designs, on the new BigCommerce theme framework, the team immediately began to see the revenue benefit.</p>
<p class="p1">“Mobile is very important to us,” said Cory Barnes, Digital Marketing Manager for Exxel Outdoors. “If you look at the percentage of visitors that are using mobile devices or tablets, the number increases every year. We expect that trend to continue and we want to make sure that someone on our site is having a great experience no matter what device they’re on.”</p>
<h3 class="p3">BombTech Golf Goes from $400,000 in Revenue to $1.1M Thanks to Mobile-Friendly Update</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="wp-image-19498 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bombtech.png" alt="new-themes-mobile-bombtech" width="400" height="740" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bombtech.png 400w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bombtech-300x555.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p3">All of our mobile traffic from social media can now check out easily.</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Tyler Sullivan, Founder of BombTech Golf</div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bombtechgolf.com/">BombTech Golf </a>drives hundreds of visitors from Facebook Live videos (which get hundreds of thousands of views), but a poor mobile experience stopped sales in their tracks.</p>
<p class="p1">With a replatform and site redesign, both focusing on mobile friendliness and UX, BombTech Golf broke the million dollar revenue mark in less than a year.</p>
<p class="p1">That was in 2015.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/bombtech-golf">In 2016, BombTech Golf pulled in $4 million in revenue</a>. In 2017, they are on track to hit nearly $9 million.</p>
<p class="p1">“I hit my stride after making $1.1 million that year,” says Tyler Sullivan, Founder of BombTech Golf. “I figured out the power of video and authenticity, beyond a mobile checkout that works. That was a game-changing moment because all of our mobile traffic from social media could now check out easily.”</p>
<h3 class="p3">BPI Sports Reports Significant Traffic Coming From Mobile, Increases Mobile Revenue 120%</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="size-full wp-image-19497 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bpi-sports.png" alt="new-themes-mobile-bpi-sports" width="400" height="717" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bpi-sports.png 400w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bpi-sports-300x538.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p3">Sadly we can&#8217;t move things over to BigCommerce every month!</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Bill Maroulis, Digital Strategy Director at BPI Sports</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">BPI Sports predominantly sells through retail channels, like Walmart and GNC, as well as online channels like Amazon. They are one of the largest supplement companies around today, and are increasingly competing with a new breed of online direct-to-consumer supplement companies.</p>
<p class="p1">Online sales is a part of their business they aimed to grow in order to own a direct relationship with their customer.</p>
<p class="p1">Realizing the importance of mobile in doing this, they launched a mobile responsive site dedicated to ease of use and customer UX.</p>
<p class="p1">Since then, mobile revenue has shot up 120% and mobile conversions 49%. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/bpi-sports/">All in less than a month</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sadly we can&#8217;t move things over to BigCommerce every month,” says Bill Maroulis, Digital Strategy Director at <a href="https://bpisports.com/">BPI Sports</a>. “Even our organic traffic went up 60 to 90%!”</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>BigCommerce is the Digital Wallet Powerhouse</h3></p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce is the only ecommerce platform that comes out of the box with proven mobile conversion tools like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/paypal">PayPal One Touch</a>. For brands focused on mobile growth, these two digital wallets drive high conversion rates through single touch checkout.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Having my audience be on a mobile platform, I want to encourage that impulse buy,” says Brandon Chatham, CEO of <a href="https://www.natomounts.com/">NatoMounts</a>. “To do that, I needed to implement systems that would allow them to checkout in literal seconds. I use PayPal, Amazon, Stripe and ApplePay to do that with BigCommerce. In the first week after we launched, we had a new visitor land on the site and hit the finish order page in less than 43 seconds.”</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>

<p class="p2"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p2">Sales have grown over 75% in the last six months, just because of this change.</p>
<p class="p2"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Alex Young, General Manager at Kap7</div></div></p>
<p class="p2">“This is our second redesign and we have gotten nothing but positive feedback from our customers,” says Alex Young, <a href="http://www.kap7.com/">Kap7</a>’s General Manager. “The upgrade has not gone unnoticed –– from the look and feel of the website, to the ease of exploring, shopping and checking out.

<p class="p3">Sales are up 320%!</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Elizabeth Przygoda-Montgomery, Owner at BoxHill</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">“Upgrading to a BigCommerce-designed theme was a huge win for us,” says Elizabeth Przygoda-Montgomery, Owner at <a href="http://www.shopboxhill.com/">BoxHill</a><span class="s1">. </span> “We now have complete control over the minor changes we wish to make on our store, and our customers have noticed, too!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Everyone remarks on the beautiful design and comments on what a clean store we have. We find that publications are more inclined to promote our store because of the new design, and vendors who have said ‘no’ to us in the past are now selling their products to us because of the improved, professional look. Sales are up 320%!”</p>

<p class="p4"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Christopher White, CEO at Ichiban Toys</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">“In the last few months, we switched to a new Stencil theme. While maintaining the same great SEO we&#8217;ve enjoyed, we could launch a new website that showed off our new focus in business,” says Christopher White, CEO at <a href="http://www.ichibantoys.com/">Ichiban Toys</a>. “Since all of our customer and product data remains in the system, it took less than one day for me to design and launch!”</p>

<p class="p3">The platform just does the work for you. That really adds up.</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">John McCann, CEO of Spectrum Audio</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">“There are some built in things on the backend of BigCommerce that I think people don’t even notice, like automatic URL redirects that are built when you change a product title,” says John McCann, CEO of <a href="http://www.spectrumaudio.com/">Spectrum Audio</a>. “Stuff like that –– where the platform just does the work for you –– really adds up. You can import redirects into BigCommerce. Even if you have a developer who knows how to do that, you’re still paying him to do something that’s built into BigCommerce automatically.”</p>
<h2 class="p2">Built In One Page Checkout</h2>
<p class="p1">All new BigCommerce themes also come with a fully responsive one-page checkout and checkout editor that enables you to change the look and feel of your checkout, including button colors, fonts and checkout header.</p>
<h3 class="p3">BigCommerce’s Checkout Replaces Need for Entire Team of Developers</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-19492" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marucci-Sports-Checkout.png" alt="Marucci Sports Checkout" width="750" height="415" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marucci-Sports-Checkout.png 1439w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marucci-Sports-Checkout-300x166.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Marucci-Sports-Checkout-750x415.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p class="p3">We basically gain an entire team of product designers and developers by using BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Dylan Staley, Systems Engineer at Marucci Sports</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">“We basically gain an entire team of product designers and developers by using BigCommerce who are dedicated to making our checkout experience the best it can be,” says Dylan Staley, Systems Engineer at <a href="https://maruccisports.com/">Marucci Sports</a>. “One other neat thing about letting BigCommerce control our checkout is that we were able to begin accepting Apple Pay with a few button clicks!”</p>
<h3 class="p2">Never Resting on Our Laurels</h3>

<p class="p1">Holiday sales are projected to increase <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Holiday-Retail-Ecommerce-Sales-Will-Grow-17-this-Year/1014529">3.3% across the board</a> this year in the U.S. For online revenue specifically, eMarketer predicts a 17.2% increase from 2015 sales.</p>
<p class="p1">That 17.2% increase will account for $94.71 billion in ecommerce revenue, totaling 10.7% of all holiday retail sales. This is the largest portion ever projected for ecommerce as a total of retail spend.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="size-full wp-image-18844 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/holiday-season-ecommerce-growth.gif" alt="holiday-season-ecommerce-growth" width="325" height="339" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/holiday-season-ecommerce-growth.gif 325w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/holiday-season-ecommerce-growth-300x313.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></p>

<p class="p1">BigCommerce has maintained 100% uptime for 3 consecutive years on the largest online shopping days in history, including Cyber Monday 2016, the biggest online transacting day to-date.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">Your brand’s ability to capture a large share of that online revenue should be your number one priority over the next month and a half.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s also BigCommerce’s number one priority for you.</p>
<p class="p1">Over the last 10 months, our team has worked with one outcome in mind: enabling BigCommerce customers to sell more as effectively and successfully as possible across all channels.</p>
<p class="p1">The holiday season is, for us, the culmination of hard work set to motion by customer ingenuity around holiday campaigns and sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, we’ve spent our entire year working to prepare our platform for this moment.</p>
<p class="p1">We want you to capture as much as possible of that $94 billion in expected holiday revenue, and we’ve <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/apps-and-integrations/">built plenty of integrations</a> we know will help you to do so.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is what we released in 2016, why it’s important and how you can implement it on your store right now to increase your revenue this holiday season.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Seamlessly Sell To Over 300 Million Amazon Customers</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-18845" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sell-on-amazon-44.png" alt="sell-on-amazon-44" width="750" height="495" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sell-on-amazon-44.png 852w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sell-on-amazon-44-300x198.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sell-on-amazon-44-750x495.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Amazon continues to be powerful driver of ecommerce. Last year, it accounted for over a quarter of online holiday sales, according to NetElixir. It should be even higher this year, as Amazon’s revenue growth continues to outpace ecommerce growth as a whole.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Yory Wurmser, eMarketer Retail Analyst</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">As of 2016, BigCommerce is the only platform to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/amazon/">natively integrate with Amazon</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Customers can push inventory directly from their BigCommerce control panel into Amazon’s marketplace, expanding product distribution, visibility and ultimately sales.</p>
<p class="p1">For years, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-success-stories/">our most successful customers have pointed to Amazon</a> as a sales channel for 10x business growth. Those same customers lamented the need to use both the BigCommerce Control Panel and Amazon’s in order to manage inventory, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-marketing-strategy/">product descriptions</a>, photography and more.</p>
<p class="p1">We worked with Amazon for more than a year to integrate the two platforms. Additional partnerships are ongoing for 2017 to continue updating the integration and adding more functionality.</p>
<p class="p1">The ultimate goal is to give you a holistic view of all of your sales channels from one vantage point. This is the function of BigCommerce’s Channel Manager, which also integrates with eBay, Facebook and Pinterest.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">After utilizing BigCommerce’s marketplace integrations, we have generated an additional $100,000 a month in revenue.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We’re still in the early part of the smartphone commerce revolution, and the development of better app search, payment systems and commerce on new platforms should propel sales strongly in 2017.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Yory Wurmser, eMarketer Retail Analyst</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Outside of Amazon, the other factor driving increased online sales is mobile. More and more people globally are gaining access to the internet, often through mobile devices. And, mobiles devices are becoming easier and easier to checkout on.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2016, data showed that 50% of traffic to a webstore came from mobile, but that 75% of sales occurred on desktop.</p>
<p class="p1">We are at the end of the road when it comes to seeing low mobile conversion rates. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/feature-detail/sell-on-mobile/">Mobile commerce</a> isn’t expected to overtake desktop commerce until 2020, but this year, it is expected to see a 43% increase –– totaling $115.92 billion in sales. That translates to 29.1% of retail ecommerce sales and 2.4% of total retail sales for the year.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="size-full wp-image-18846 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/holiday-selling-device.gif" alt="holiday-selling-device" width="325" height="330" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/holiday-selling-device.gif 325w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/holiday-selling-device-300x305.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Many online businesses are already preparing for the mobile first era by <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/category/ecommerce-design/">updating site design and UX</a> to prioritize for mobile. This includes sideswiping, product videos on product pages and mobile wallet checkouts for instance.</p>
<p class="p1">In November, BigCommerce launched a new theme and the industry’s first mobile-first template out of the box. The theme is called Touch, and it was designed with celebrity fashion designer LaQuan Smith –– one of the first designers to launch a see now, buy now collection at New York Fashion Week –– and Pixel Union, the industry&#8217;s most successful website design agency.</p>

<p class="p1">Our blended cost of acquisition when you look on how much we spent on advertising versus how many new customers we have is under $5 a customer.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">John Lott, Spearmint Love</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Nearly every platform on the internet where a brand could build an audience is looking to expand into commerce. This includes Facebook, Pinterest, SnapChat and more.</p>
<p class="p1">Social commerce was once heralded as the new commerce channel, but few businesses have seen social commerce truly take off.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2016, Facebook and BigCommerce decided to tackle that anomaly.</p>
<p class="p1">Was it that no one was shopping on Facebook? Or, was it that the analytics weren’t correct? It turns out to have been a combination of both, each giving more weight to the other.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s start with consumers shopping on Facebook.</p>
<p class="p1">When Facebook Shop was first launched, brands could add a “Buy” button to their posts and create a separate Shop tab on their business page to feature products. When a customer wanted to check out, they were then forced back to the retailer’s own website. This added an additional step in an already convoluted buyer journey.</p>
<p class="p1">Facebook updated this in 2016. Consumers can now checkout without ever having to leave the social media platform –– or at least brands can offer them that option.</p>
<p class="p1">But, to the real question, is any of this working?</p>
<p class="p1">Are consumers checking out from Facebook as a channel, either on Facebook or back on a retailer’s own website?</p>
<p class="p1">The answer is, well, challenging. While Facebook can track conversion son its own platform, it was difficult to get retailers to understand how to track conversions on their own site coming from a Facebook post or ad.</p>
<p class="p1">Like Google Analytics, in order to track a Facebook conversion on a website that isn’t Facebook, a pixel must exist.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike with Google Analytics, retailers were not installing the pixel.</p>
<p class="p1">Turns out that most ecommerce managers are marketers first and developers second, if at all. Facebook’s manual site pixel placement and developer-friendly language for dropping it in wasn’t resonating.</p>
<p class="p1">So, together, BigCommerce and Facebook <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/facebook-shop/">launched a new Facebook integration</a> that <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/new-tools-advertise-on-facebook/">automatically adds the Facebook pixel to a website</a>. This allows marketers to clearly understand how Facebook ads and Shop are <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-advertising-costs/">contributing to their bottom line</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">And, as it turns out, a lot of brands are seeing the Facebook lift. Here are quotes from just two of them.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Facebook Shop</h3>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We see customers checking out directly on Facebook on a regular basis,&#8221; says Krissy Sexton, founder of <a href="http://www.thehairbowcompany.com/">The Hair Bow Company</a>. &#8220;They don&#8217;t have to leave Facebook, they can just shop the items that are in the photos. That&#8217;s helped increase the effectiveness of our ads. It&#8217;s also helped customers be able to easily find exactly what they&#8217;re looking for from our ads.&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="p1">Facebook Tracking Pixel</h3>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Just to give you a sense [of our Facebook success], we have a cost of acquisition of $8 on our ad spend,&#8221; says John Lott, partner at <a href="http://spearmintlove.com/">Spearmint Love</a>. &#8220;That doesn’t include for that same amount of money that I got a 121,903 Facebook likes. I get to talk to those people everyday now that I’ve acquired them. Our blended cost of acquisition when you look on how much we spent on advertising versus how many new customers we have is under $5 a customer.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="p3">3x Sales with Google Shopping and BigCommerce API Partnership</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-18848" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/google-shopping-bigcommerce.png" alt="google-shopping-bigcommerce" width="750" height="599" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/google-shopping-bigcommerce.png 1268w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/google-shopping-bigcommerce-300x239.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/google-shopping-bigcommerce-750x599.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We sought out BigCommerce because of their robust catalog API.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">James Summerfield, Google</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Google Shopping remains one of the most effective ways for online businesses to earn traffic and conversions through advertising. And, the good folks over at Google are continuously working to make the shopping experience for the consumers better –– providing increased success for their advertisers (you!).</p>
<p class="p1">Like with the Facebook story, however, success is only achievable in proper measurement and setup. And, like Facebook, the previous way to properly set up Google Shopping tracking and functionality was for a marketer to go to their development team.</p>
<p class="p1">This dev step caused 25% of ecommerce marketers trying to setup the integration to just give up.</p>
<p class="p1">This was not acceptable for either BigCommerce or Google, and it began a year long project between the two companies. The goal was to configure the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/google-shopping/">first-ever Google Shopping integration</a> with an ecommerce platform that seamlessly pushes data over to Google Shopping in real-time – no development work needed.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about this. In the past, ecommerce marketers would have to implement code to set up a data feed to run into Google Shopping. A quarter of them never even passed that first stage. Another portion of them never updated that data feed. This means that inaccurate data was being passed to Google Shopping and used in advertising – likely decreasing ad effectiveness and ROI.</p>
<p class="p1">They say you can’t improve what you don’t measure. This was a case of not being able to even properly measure due to an often overlooked step in the process.</p>
<p class="p1">So, in 2016, BigCommerce and Google <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/ecommerce-api/">used BigCommerce’s API</a> to resolve both issues, removing two fundamental and time-consuming steps in the Google Shopping process.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, stores integrated with Google Shopping can set up ads for their products and know that those products will be updated in Google Shopping anytime they update them on their site.</p>
<p class="p1">And, for those brands who have yet to implement Google Shopping, nothing is stopping you. Integrate with the app and you can begin advertising and measuring in no time.</p>

<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-18849" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-integration.png" alt="ebay-integration" width="750" height="442" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-integration.png 1084w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-integration-300x177.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ebay-integration-750x442.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We have taken our business from suspended accounts to more than $100,000 in monthly sales, winning eBay awards for the highest conversion rates.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Victor Levin, CrazyLister and Camera Kings</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce invested heavily in omni-channel retail in 2016, and eBay was our final push of the year.</p>
<p class="p1">eBay’s platform serves 165 million worldwide buyers, making it a great testing ground for U.S. brands thinking about international expansion as well as a great sales channel in general for all online sellers.</p>
<p class="p1">Our eBay and Amazon interactions have produced some of the highest revenue for customers since launch. One customer, <a href="https://wirencable.com/">Wire N Cabl</a>e, has produced $80,000 in Amazon revenue and a cool $20,000 on eBay.</p>
<p class="p1">And Wire N Cable is no outlying case. Other customers including <a href="http://glorycycles.com/">Glory Cycles</a>, <a href="http://www.golfetail.com/">Golf Etail</a> and <a href="https://camerakings.co.uk/">Camera Kings</a> are seeing similar success –– nabbing spots as top eBay sellers and converters.</p>
<p class="p1">The truth of the matter is this: customers will shop anywhere and at anytime. It is getting more and more difficult to predict their purchasing path. To combat this, many brands are <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/multichannel-selling-online-marketplace-considerations-to-boost-sales/">expanding into marketplace territory</a> and seeing incredible growth results.</p>
<p class="p1">With <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ebay/">BigCommerce and eBay’s integration</a>, an ecommerce marketers can push products over to eBay, edit descriptions and set prices all from one interface.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Sell to 93% of Pinterest Users Looking to Purchase on Pinterest</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-18851 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pins.png" alt="pins" width="638" height="886" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pins.png 638w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pins-300x417.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p class="p1">There’s no denying that Pinterest is a high-potential ecommerce channel. With more than 100 million monthly active users, 93% of whom use Pinterest to plan for purchases, Pinterest may be the key for many sellers to unlocking the benefits of social commerce.</p>
<p class="p1">Pinterest’s Buy Button launched in 2015, but it has been a slow roll in getting brands involved. This isn’t because of platform limitations on either company’s side. Instead, it is due to Pinterest&#8217;s deep desire to make sure that the offering in unparalleled across the social commerce industry.</p>
<p class="p1">So far, larger brands like Native Union have seen immense success. Over the course of the next year, it is likely the platform will allow more open integration for brands of all sizes.</p>
<p class="p1">One thing we do know is this: selling on Pinterest is working.</p>
<p class="p1">And, it’s already integrated in the BigCommerce Channel Manager. Much like with Facebook, Google, Amazon and eBay, BigCommerce merchants accepting by Pinterest to sell on Pinterest can easily push products over through the control panel, getting a holistic view of omni-channel activities.</p>
<p class="p1">We will keep you updated to any changes in the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/pinterest/">Pinterest flow to begin using Buyable Pins</a>. Know, though, that the vast majority of brands getting to sell on the platform are coming through ecommerce platforms like BigCommerce. These are prioritized in their queue and we are continuously working to add functionality to additional stores.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Optimize for Omni-Channel Shipping Capabilities</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Been using ShipStation for a couple months and it sure has saved time and money. The ability to quickly compare the USPS price to the UPS price has saved me a bunch of money. Not to mention the ability to update my store and marketplaces from one interface has been a time saver!</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Ecommerce Marketer, BBQFans.com</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">With all of the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">focus on omni-channel retail this year</a>, it would have been remiss of us to not also make sure that all of your packages— no matter the channel— can get to the customer as needed.</p>
<p class="p1">To do this, we’ve partnered with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shipstation/">ShipStation</a>, the leading multi-carrier shipping solution in the industry. We vetted many companies for this position, but found ShipStation to be the clear leader for all BigCommerce merchant sizes, from small business to mid-market enterprise.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is why we found ShipStation superior:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">The solution is easy to activate and use.</li>
<li class="p1">It supports the largest number of domestic shipping carriers.</li>
<li class="p1">ShipStation enables BigCommerce customers to receive the lowest possible USPS and Fedex label rates available, and they can easily activate their own account with negotiated rates for a multitude of other shipping carriers, such as UPS and DHL.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce merchants should have received a notification in their control panel about the update. But in case you missed it, know this:</p>
<p class="p1">All BigCommerce merchants are eligible for a free ShipStation account that includes a USPS postage account with the best rates to save over 50% on USPS Postal Office/USPS.com rates. BigCommerce merchants can continue to use this for free for the first 50 labels/month. This is an exclusive offer Shipstation for BigCommerce customers only. No only solution provides this free of charge.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is what you get with your free account:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Print Shipping Labels and Packing Slips in Batch:</strong> With ShipStation, you can process and print hundreds of labels in a single batch. Print pick lists, packing slips, and labels easily and quickly to either your local printer or any printer in the world! No more manual data entry for you.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Unlimited Selling Channels:</strong> We want to make you efficient at fulfilling orders, wherever you sell online. That&#8217;s why no matter which pricing plan you&#8217;re on, you can add as many selling channels as you want. Selling on Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and more? Add all your accounts to ShipStation to easily sync orders and shipping data. For no extra charge.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Shipping Carriers:</strong> ShipStation supports USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, Canada Post, and more. There&#8217;s no need for add-on tools such as UPS WorldShip. ShipStation also allows you to retrieve real-time rates and take advantage of the best prices from each carrier.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>No Software to Install:</strong> ShipStation is a web-based solution that is hosted in the cloud. This means that you never have to worry about installing software, upgrading, or backing up your data.

<h2 class="p3">BigCommerce is Officially on Code Freeze</h2>
<p class="p1">Each year, BigCommerce enters code freeze before the official start of the holidays. Doing so has helped us <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/secure-web-hosting/">achieve 100% uptime</a> over the last three holiday seasons, including on Black Friday –– the two highest trafficked online shopping days in history.</p>
<p class="p1">A code freeze is a development term which means that no code can be edited or modified during the freeze period. It’s done to ensure steady uptime and site speed during high traffic periods, rather than releasing new code.</p>
<p class="p1">For BigCommerce, a code freeze means we stop making changes, integrations or updates to the platform during our customer’s highest traffic periods. This ensures that your customers have a frictionless shopping experience — which is always our top priority.</p>
<p class="p1">Essentially, we are getting out of your way so you can be as successful as possible during the most trafficked shopping season of the year.</p>
<p class="p1">As of today, we are officially on code freeze for the remainder of 2016.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Our product team is heads down on 2017 planning, with hands off the product until that time.</li>
<li class="p1">Our support and education teams are focused on helping our customers get the most out of the BigCommerce platform. They are working around the clock to answer any questions you may have. You can <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/contact?q=">chat them here</a>, call 1-888-699-8911 or email <a href="mailto:support@bigcommerce.com">support@bigcommerce.com</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">Our marketing and sales teams are slowing down communications, reducing emails to the bare essentials so you can focus on your sales without missing a thing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Our year has officially wound down. But for most of our customers, it is just about to take off.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Happy Selling Season!</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We have zero developers. We’ve [been so successful] by leveraging every tool you’ve given us. There is rarely a product or tool that you guys will launch that I won&#8217;t test or try in some way.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">John Lott, Spearmint Love</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">We hope you are prepared. We hope you’ve used every possible outlet to increase sales, brand visibility and set yourself up for success.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ll be here on phone lines if you need help.</p>
<p class="p1">In the meantime, know that we are dedicated to your technical success this holiday season.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ll be back at it in 2017 to continue iterating on our product and making partnerships with best-in-class companies to make you a more successful online seller.</p>

The “dream big” mentality.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s also the actualization of your brand promise to your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">That gives innovation an important role in your business, especially at a point in time in which consumers value brand transparency and shopping convenience over nearly all else.</p>
<p class="p1">According to PWC, shoppers today “<a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/retail-consumer/global-total-retail.html">have higher expectations than prior generations</a>, value transparency, favor convenience over price and shop via mobile more than ever.”</p>
<p class="p1">Failing to provide for these shopper expectations is an inhibitor to your success.</p>
<p class="p1">How you prioritize and execute on these needs is crucial to your brand growth now and in the future. Technology certainly helps, and can be the bridge you need to close the gap between customer expectation and brand capability.</p>
<p class="p1">But for your brand to be truly innovative, you must go above and beyond. Technology can only take you so far. You have to drive that extra mile to surpass customer expectations and deliver on your brand’s ultimate promise: to be the trusted and preferred leader in your space.</p>
<p class="p1">We launched the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/innovation-awards/">BigCommerce Innovation Awards</a> to find those leaders, and uncover the strategies and inventions hiding in the code that customers can’t see. In doing so, we were beyond impressed with the innovations coming from our BigCommerce community, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="#storeyourboard">Product page customization that out-Amazons Amazon, and ranks #1 on Google:</a></strong> StoreYourBoard’s transformation of product pages into living landing pages complete with FAQs, customer photos and an entire community rallying around products in a review system unparalleled even to Amazon’s.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="#knobs">Visual search more powerful than Pinterest:</a></strong> The Knob Co’s custom image-search functionality allows customers to upload an image of any doorknob –– from anywhere –– resulting in an exact or near exact match from 50,000 SKUs in less than a minute.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="#awesomegti">A data clean-up of a lifetime, and one employee’s powerful Board presentation:</a></strong> AwesomeGTI was in a rough place, with 50,000 SKUs on an outdated platform, each poorly aligned to data sources created by an ex-employee no one could understand. With investors holding their feet to the fire, the company has figured out a way to do a 180 in less than 6 months.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="#cadenlane">On-site personalization that creates self-selected custom audiences, and saved one B2B business from bankruptcy:</a></strong> Caden Lane’s product page customization tool allows customers to mix and match all styles of product to build the perfect bedroom set for their newborns. With 193% growth in the last year, personalization has been the key to Caden Lane’s transition from B2B to B2C, and kept their business not only above water, but millions in revenue.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="#mancrates">An engineering feat never seen before (hint: lasers included):</a></strong> Man Crates’ automated laser-etching system spanning two warehouses and thousands of orders per day –– getting customized orders ready only four minutes after checkout, and on their way to the customer for next day delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Here are the brands that brought about the most innovative ecommerce implementations in 2016, and what you can learn from their success.</p>
<p><a name="storeyourboard"></a></p>
<h2 class="p1">StoreYourBoard: Grand Prize Winner for Implementing Amazon-Level Complexity at the Product Page Level</h2>
<p class="p2"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p2">All questions and product reviews are generated by our customers, managed by us from our custom-built administrative control panel. Best of all, all of the content is crawl-able by search engines.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p2"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Michael Leff, Vice President of Technology at StoreYourBoard</div></div></p>
<h3 class="p3">The Backstory</h3>
<p class="p2">Search engines crawl pages while evaluating keywords, reader engagement and frequency of updates (among many key factors) to rank their final results. This is true both on Google <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seo-strategy/">as well as Amazon</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">In fact, Amazon product pages consistently achieve high Google rankings because of how effectively high-volume sellers on that site use keywords and update product descriptions to include answers to frequently asked customer questions.</p>
<p class="p2">For those <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/selling-on-amazon/">selling on Amazon</a>, this is just business-as-usual, part of Amazon’s high-quality, customer-centric requirements. Sellers that don’t do this, and receive too many customer complaints, will be kicked off the marketplace.</p>
<p class="p2">For webstore owners, there is no such penalty for failing to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/perfect-product-description-formula/">update product descriptions</a> or include an on-page FAQ.</p>
<p class="p2">There is quite a bit of reward though: increased search engine ranking and customer satisfaction, for instance.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.storeyourboard.com/">StoreYourBoard</a>, a company producing products for tricky-to-store items like bikes and surf boards, looked at how Amazon was engaging customers and providing feedback –– and then built a custom solution to increase search ranking and decrease customer calls and questions.</p>
<h3 class="p3">The Problem</h3>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>25%</span></h3></p>
<p class="p2">Percent of customers who submit a question and end up purchasing.</p>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p2"><em>As described by Michael Leff, Vice President of Technology at StoreYourBoard to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p2">We got a lot of questions all the time through email about products on our site.</p>
<p class="p2">We knew there were probably a lot more people with the same questions, but weren’t asking them.</p>
<p class="p2">If we&#8217;re getting five emails a day with questions, we know a larger percentage of people had the same concerns or hesitations –– and those people are, in turn, not purchasing because they didn&#8217;t know how to find the information they needed.</p>
<h3 class="p3">The Plan</h3>

<p class="p2"><em>As described by Michael Leff, Vice President of Technology at StoreYourBoard to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p2">We wanted to make it really easy for someone to ask a question, and we wanted them to be able to do it right on the product page.</p>
<p class="p2">We didn’t want them to have to go open their email, copy the product link, and go tab back and forth between the product and the email.</p>
<p class="p2">If a customer just wanted to ask a question, it should be super easy for them to do that.</p>
<p class="p2">Now, we’ve built a system that allows customers to do just that.</p>
<p class="p2">When they ask a question, it gets submitted and goes right to our customer service department with the product link and the question they asked.</p>
<p class="p2">There&#8217;s no back and forth between a customer and our customer service department. No, &#8220;Oh, exactly what product were you asking about? Can you send me a link just to make sure?&#8221;</p>
<p class="p2">It&#8217;s all very efficiently put together so that we can quickly answer the question, and get it documented for anyone else looking for an answer to a similar inquiry.</p>

<h3 class="p1">The Technology</h3>

<p class="p2">Number of user-answered questions in the FAQ section across the site.</p>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p2"><em>As described by Michael Leff, Vice President of Technology at StoreYourBoard to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p2">We built our own server to host these reviews and the questions. This is where the questions actually come in.</p>
<p class="p2">Our customer service department can log in, see new questions, and approve questions as FAQs to be pushed to the product pages.</p>
<p class="p2">The way it&#8217;s actually stored on the page is a combination of custom work using the BigCommerce API and custom frontend code in our actual theme development.</p>
<p class="p2">What we do is hide the content.</p>
<p class="p2">All of the FAQ content is in the product description as far as the technology goes. It&#8217;s hidden in these parts that are within special HTML classes. We have Javascript that parses it correctly and puts it in its own product review section and formats it correctly.</p>
<p class="p2">One of the really cool things about the customer reviews in particular is that we were able to build this really cool, mobile friendly landing page.</p>
<p class="p2">We send out emails X number of days after the customer has purchased or received the item and request reviews. That&#8217;s where we get a lot of feedback and all the reviews you see.</p>
<p class="p2">We were able to really customize all of that. Now, we have a really nice layout of each product with an image, customer reviews and updated FAQs.</p>
<p class="p2">If you&#8217;re on a tablet, it looks good.</p>
<p class="p2">If you&#8217;re on a cell phone, it looks good.</p>
<p class="p2">The mobile-friendliness of it, and of Stencil, has really helped. It’s so easy to leave a review from an email. As soon as we get them to click on the link in the email, everyone leaves a review. No one is like, &#8220;Oh, this is a hassle.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p2">&#8220;Thanks to BigCommerce’s robust APIs and customizable template files, we were able to build an FAQ and review system on our product pages to address these questions,&#8221; says Michael Leff, Vice President of Technology at StoreYourBoard. &#8220;All of the questions and product reviews are generated by our customers, managed by us from our custom-built administrative control panel, and with a push of a button, set live on the product page in the store. Best of all, the content is crawlable by search engines.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="p4">The Knobs Company: People’s Choice Winner for State-of-the-Art Image Search Capabilities</h2>
<p class="p2"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p2">Our search by image feature has brought on-site search time down 100 fold. What used to be done manually and can now be done automatically.</p>
<p class="p2"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">David Mason, CEO at The Knobs Company</div></div></p>
<h3 class="p1">The Backstory</h3>
<p class="p2">Solving for search functionality is difficult. Case in point: Google updates its search algorithm <a href="https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change">500-600 times per year</a>. And all of that is just to help people looking for your products land on your site.</p>
<p class="p2">What happens, then, when you have a product catalog of more than 50,000 items?</p>
<p class="p2">Site visitors coming from any referring domain — whether that be organic traffic through Google or even an email sent from your marketing team — have a huge hurdle to jump before they can purchase from you.</p>
<p class="p2">They have to find the item they want.</p>
<p class="p2">That’s a hard task to accomplish with so many items available. Studies show humans can only make a set number of decisions per day –– including what to wear, when to shower and which route to take to work. If you have 50,000 SKUs, you’re asking your consumers to painstakingly navigate your catalog and use up some of their limited daily allotment of decisions with your store.</p>
<p class="p2">That’s just not feasible.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.knobs.co/">The Knobs Company</a> is one such brand with more than 50,000 products. Most of their customers come to the site already knowing what they want, having seen it in a design magazine, on Pinterest or at a friend’s home. The problem is that those customers have no name, style or technical specifications for their desired item.</p>
<p class="p2">All they have is a photo, making on-site text searches pointless.</p>
<p class="p2">To help customers find the exact item they want, The Knobs Company went in search for an ecommerce innovation: on-site image search capabilities, rather than text.</p>
<p class="p2">“We’ve been able to integrate a ‘search by image’ feature that allows customers to search through our entire catalog using an image,” says David Mason, CEO. “This can be an image they took of their existing pieces or even an image they take off a layout in a magazine. We even have a Pinterest integration so they can search directly from their Pinterest boards.”</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Problem</h3>

<p class="p2">Percent increase in conversion rate.</p>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p2"><em>As described by David Mason, CEO at The Knobs Company to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p2">Our buying process is the antithesis of Amazon.com. You can get to Amazon&#8217;s customer service if you want to, but it’s really hard. They don&#8217;t make it easy at all.</p>
<p class="p2">We&#8217;re the exact opposite.</p>
<p class="p2">If you look at the cabinet hardware industry, it&#8217;s pretty much price controlled. The prices are set by the manufacturers, not by the stores. Almost everybody sells at the minimum just like we do.</p>
<p class="p2">The big advantage that we have over other stores is the shopping experience and the service that we offer. We really want people to be interacting with us.</p>
<p class="p2">We want people interacting with our customer service team as much as possible. We want them consulting with us. I don&#8217;t know of any customer service team that comes anywhere near ours in terms of quality in our space.</p>
<p class="p2">This is our differentiator in the market. And we have people come to us, show us pictures and say, &#8220;Hey do you have anything like this? This is on my existing cabinets. I need something that will match this.&#8221; Or, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen this knob. I really like this. Do you have anything like that?&#8221;</p>
<p class="p2">I&#8217;ve had customer service people spending hours looking for a match and it can be very difficult. We have more than 50,000 SKUs. We needed to optimize for customer experience, and that meant making the search process easier, based on how customers were already looking for the product.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Plan</h3>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>100%</span></h3></p>

<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p2"><em>As described by David Mason, CEO at The Knobs Company to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p2">We were at the High Point Furniture Show displaying our knobs and these guys from Think Deeply approached us at the booth. They had this brand new technology and were looking for companies to beta test it.</p>
<p class="p2">It was really, really early in their whole process of developing their image search product.</p>
<p class="p2">Now in conversations with them, the product really wasn&#8217;t ready for market, but I was excited anyway. I&#8217;m always looking for new innovations and new technologies. I knew we had a need for a similar product, and here were people who were willing to build it out for us. This innovation in particular really came to us.</p>
<p class="p2">Today, you can go to Pinterest, search cabinet hardware and find Pinterest boards you like or find kitchens that you like and connect your Pinterest board to our website. If you just log in with your Pinterest account and connect it, you can search the entire site by the pictures in those boards.</p>
<p class="p2">You can take a picture with your phone, connect to your Pinterest board, grab a photo of something you found online and load it into our search. You can do whatever you want with whatever picture you want, and it’ll search the catalog by it.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>As described by David Mason, CEO at The Knobs Company to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p2">For Think Deeply to work, we had to make sure our category tiers and product data were set up perfectly on the backend. We needed to be able to create landing pages by product attribute.</p>
<p class="p2">In order to be able to create landing pages for each of our main product attributes, we put all of our data into BigCommerce as categories. We have a million categories.</p>
<p class="p2">For instance, length of product is an attribute. The main length that we have is the drill center, the distance between the two screws on a pole. If a customer has pre-drilled cabinets and they&#8217;re replacing existing poles, they know that they’ve got holes that are three inches apart. They only want to be searching for poles that have three inch drill centers. We made small variants like that categories across the entire site.</p>
<p class="p2">One product might be under 30 different categories because it&#8217;s got a length and it&#8217;s got a width and it&#8217;s got a finish and it&#8217;s got a collection. It&#8217;s crucial for us that each of those be pages that people can access, where they can see all the products in the collection, all the products of this size, all the products in this finish.</p>
<p class="p2">It was incredibly important that BigCommerce had all of those categories –– however many of them there are –– and that it was all structured really well. Think Deeply then works off our category tiers.</p>

<h2 class="p4">Awesome GTI: Innovation Award Winner for an Unparalleled UX in the Automotive Industry</h2>
<p class="p2"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p2">The whole project showcased a level of innovation in our marketplace above and beyond what the customer base is used to seeing.</p>
<p class="p2"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Wayne Ainsworth, Operations at Awesome GTI</div></div></p>
<h3 class="p1">The Backstory</h3>
<p class="p2">Cars are rarely bought online. After all, buying a car means taking it for a test drive, hands on the wheel, foot on that accelerator, new car smell wafting throughout.</p>
<p class="p2">The same is true for <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/showcase/automotive/">automotive parts</a>, though the experience is quite different.</p>
<p class="p2">When looking for parts, many consumers end up at a service station, visiting a brick-and-mortar in the same way hoards of people used to flock to malls when they needed an item.</p>
<p class="p2">Few retail sectors still see this kind of foot traffic. Of course, there is a driving factor: not everyone knows how to install the new items (which service stations and brick-and-mortar parts shops can do for you). It’s often more convenient, then, for consumers to go in-store to both purchase and have their vehicle serviced.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.awesomegti.com/">Awesome GTI</a>, an online Audi parts seller, doesn’t buy into this traditional thinking.</p>
<p class="p2">Instead, the team has worked hard to migrate more than 50,000 individual SKUs to a modern ecommerce platform, redesigned the entire site from the ground up to optimize for user experience and is keeping site and product content fresh to increase search engine rankings and discoverability.</p>
<p class="p2">This kind of work may sound like business as usual for retailers in other sectors. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/new-report-proves-unanimous-agreement-time-ripe-change-fashion-industry/">Fashion and beauty, for instance</a>, have long had to optimize for user experience and product transparency on page to win conversions.</p>
<p class="p2">But, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/automotive/">in the automotive space</a>, this type of site experience isn’t unusual –– it’s unheard of.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Problem</h3>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>40%</span></h3></p>
<p class="p2">Percent increase in average order value.</p>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p2"><em>As described by Wayne Ainsworth, Operations at Awesome GTI to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p2">I joined the business four years ago, and at the time, AwesomeGTI <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/reviews/bigcommerce-vs-magento">had a Magento website</a>. It was OK, but as I&#8217;m sure a lot of companies and people know Magento as a platform <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/saas-ecommerce-on-premise/">needs to have a lot of resources dedicated to keep it maintained</a>, keep it updated and keep it running smoothly.</p>
<p class="p2">My initial role was to come in and do a little bit of fire fighting because there were a few problems. Various parts of the site that weren&#8217;t working as expected and a few other development issues. That quickly turned into a full time role within three months.</p>
<p class="p2">I then spent then 12 months trying to configure Awesome GTI’s Magento installation, but it had been modified in such a way that the core files had been modified, rather than using the extension system.</p>
<p class="p2">Overtime, that meant there were various exploits, patches and fixes required, as is the case with a lot of open source platforms. We couldn&#8217;t develop the site further because there were so many inconsistencies with the files and various other things.</p>
<p class="p2">So, I went to the shareholders. I said, “Look, if we want to move forward, we have to seriously look into the concept that we&#8217;re going to have to move away from Magento, start almost from scratch.”</p>
<p class="p2">Now, obviously as soon as I said that they were very scared, you might say –– as anybody would be. At that time, there was over 75,000 products on the site, not including variations. The database was huge, but the way I saw it, we didn’t have choice.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Plan</h3>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>24%</span></h3></p>
<p class="p2">Percent increase in mobile traffic to the site.</p>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p2"><em>As described by Wayne Ainsworth, Operations at Awesome GTI to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p2">We did the due diligence. We spoke to everybody we thought we needed to speak to about <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-platforms/">which platforms were the best</a>. We narrowed it down to BigCommerce and Shopify Plus.</p>
<p class="p2">Well, let me say, BigCommerce was a no brainer for a lot of reasons. One was the enterprise package that BigCommerce was offering was, for us, exactly what we needed. At the end of the day, we have very little resources to help on a development level. It was just me and maybe one other guy that helped with products. That was it. BigCommerce offers, as part of the enterprise package, a catalog transfer, which was a huge.</p>
<p class="p2">I imagine even for the transfer guys at BigCommerce, that must be such a huge undertaking. We have so many products in our catalog.</p>
<p class="p2">The fact that that was on the table straightaway and the fact that it all went so smoothly and everything worked so well, we know we made the right decision. We&#8217;ve never looked back since.</p>
<p class="p2">Fast forward to today and our average order volume has gone up by something like 40%.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Technology</h3>

<p class="p2">Percent decrease in abandoned cart.</p>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p2"><em>As described by Wayne Ainsworth, Operations at Awesome GTI to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p2">The shareholders by their own admission are not technical people. They&#8217;re old-school engineering, automotive guys.</p>
<p class="p2">They just know that we have a website and it works well.</p>
<p class="p2">They came to me three months after the site relaunch and they said, “How have you done this? What have you done?”</p>
<p class="p2">I said straight up I have not actually done physically anything. This is just BigCommerce doing what they said they were going to do out of the box. These features that we looked at when we decided to go with BigCommerce are working as intended.</p>
<p class="p1">Our previous website had zero mobile responsive design on it. We now get 45% of our traffic from mobile. And, the system is making it easy for people to purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Our bounce rate is reduced. The amount of time that people spend on the site has increased. We know that the sales are drastically up across all mediums, not just mobile. We&#8217;ve been able to better track the payment system.</p>
<p class="p1">I personally use the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/ecommerce-analytics/">BigCommerce Analytics</a> more than Google Analytics because it gives me a more scope. Google Analytics is mainly used by the shareholders, the sales manager and the general manager to see what is working in marketing. To be fair, for them it&#8217;s easier for them to use Google Analytics because that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re used to using.</p>
<p class="p1">I am getting them more on board with BigCommerce Analytics though because some of the stuff just works really well. I do that with anything the platform comes out with. I ask, “Do we need this? Can we use this? Is it going to help?”</p>
<p class="p1">So far, we haven&#8217;t had any reason not to use all new tools and integrations because everything we&#8217;ve done has just worked.</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t have worry about server maintenance, or software maintenance anymore. I know that the infrastructure is so solid that we would never have to worry about down time.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s all come along so well in fact that we have a second site rolling out this week on the BigCommerce platform and we have a third one in development, which will be another enterprise level site. We are working on a fourth business using the BigCommerce platform as a B2B system.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, we are confident that as far as from a customer point of view, we&#8217;re able to offer our customers a far greater level of customer experience, a far better buying experience and a much more streamlined process.</p>
<h3 class="p3">The Success</h3>

<h2 class="p4">Caden Lane: Innovation Award Winner for Customer Controlled Product Page Customization</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We’ve had record breaking growth, and our business has become almost 100% direct to consumer.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Katy Mimari, Owner at Caden Lane</div></div></p>
<h3 class="p3">The Backstory</h3>
<p class="p1">The year was 2009. The economy was crumbling. The U.S. was on the verge of the Great Recession.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://cadenlane.com/">Caden Lane</a>, a wholesaler of baby bedding and diaper bags to larger brands like Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, decided to add a shopping cart to their existing online catalog.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/find-product-niche-start-selling-online/" target="_blank">The decision to sell online</a> was a difficult one. Caden Lane would now be a direct competitor to its distribution partners. But, it was a decision that needed to happen to ensure Caden Lane’s long-term success.</p>
<p class="p1">In that year, many of its high-end baby boutique distribution partners would close, leaving Caden Lane to fend for itself in a new B2C market.</p>
<p class="p1">The business needed to diversify its channel mix to avoid going the way of their shuttered friends.</p>
<h3 class="p3">The Problem</h3>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>195%</span></h3></p>
<p class="p2">Percent increase in traffic to the site.</p>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">Selling B2C rather than B2B requires an entirely different mindset. Katy needed to figure out how to standout in a crowded market –– a market that in many respects was already selling her product.</p>
<p class="p1">She was competing against her former partners, for her own sales.</p>
<p class="p1">With few resources and little B2C experience, Katy began to research –– noting which features on <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/best-ecommerce-website-design/">other successful websites</a> both within and outside her own industry were catching her eye.</p>
<p class="p1">One thing stood out above the rest: personalization.</p>
<p class="p1">Across the web, the B2C industry was <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/rfm-model/">optimizing for personalization</a> –– and brands that got it right were winning. Katy knew that for the baby furniture and bedding market, personalization could play a pivotal role.</p>
<p class="p1">Every parent and child is unique –– in both style and preferred materials, down to the nitty gritty details. But parents are time strapped, more so than almost any other online shopper. Convenience plays a pivotal role, and many new parents were shifting to Amazon-only shopping as a result.</p>
<p class="p1">Caden Lane offered all product possibilities, but Katy knew the brand needed to offer increased personalization at an unparalleled level of convenience.</p>

<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">First, Caden Lane needed to switch from Magento to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/saas-ecommerce-on-premise/">a cloud-based platform that offered more flexibility</a>. Once relaunched on BigCommerce, Katy worked with several preferred partners and programmers to customize mix-and-match features that allow customers to pick and choose different pieces of their baby bedding from a single product listing.</p>
<p class="p1">This removed the need to click around from tab to tab. Instead, all items could be added to cart from a single page –– moving customers further down the funnel with every click.</p>

<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">“As we learned about SEO and prioritized our direct-to-consumer approach to marketing, we realized how our current platform didn’t offer us the ability to manage our backend or design template very well,” said Katy Mimari, Owner at Caden Lane.</p>
<p class="p1">“After months of research, we decided to switch platforms and joined BigCommerce. Since then, we’ve had record breaking growth, and our business has become almost 100% direct to consumer. We absolutely credit BigCommerce’s themes, simple backend and product management, and the ability to customize our website for our own customer’s needs.”</p>
<h3 class="p3">The Success</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">195% growth in traffic to the site</li>
<li class="p1">267% growth in conversions and transactions</li>
<li class="p1">33% growth in revenue</li>
<li class="p1">18% increase in conversion rate</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Control Over Customization</h3></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We also custom coded our sale banner to show up on every product page. Now, if a customer lands on a page other than our home page (through a link, or google ad) they still will see the notification of the sale or promotions without having to leave the page,&#8221; says Katy Mimari, owner and designer. &#8220;We have also benefited from BigCommerce&#8217;s Google Shopping integration, and how easily we can pick and chose each product to be included in it, with the ability to alter the listings easily.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="p4">Man Crates: Innovation Award Winner for Building an Automated Laser Etching System from Scratch + Next Day Delivery</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Shipping with ludicrous speed as our volumes have increased took as much innovation and collaboration as anything else we&#8217;ve ever had to do as a business.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Sam Gong, Co-Founder at Man Crates</div></div></p>
<h3 class="p3">The Backstory</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.mancrates.com/">Man Crates</a> is a unique gift box for men. The business sells both generic and custom gift boxes –– and it’s those custom boxes that forced the team to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">rethink their shipping practices</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">After all, in a time constrained culture where last-minute ordering is commonplace (and retail behemoths like Amazon have accustomed customers to short shipping times), Man Crates often receives custom order requests at 4 p.m. on a Monday to be delivered that Wednesday.</p>
<p class="p1">“Shipping with ludicrous speed as our volumes have increased took as much innovation and collaboration as anything else we’ve ever had to do as a business,” says Sam Gong, co-founder of Man Crates.</p>
<p class="p1">Two major problems presented themselves when it came to creating and shipping custom orders in less than 24 hours.</p>
<p class="p1">First, “making personalized products requires a team of graphic designers reviewing orders and creating unique print files with highly-trained laser operators to produce each piece. Adjusting and centering font size and the layout of the design are all important tasks that raise quality, but this takes a lot of time at the computer. Applying etching adhesives, aligning physical pieces in the print tray, and calibrating the settings based on the material properties of the glass, wood, or metal to ensure crisp etching takes a lot of time at the laser.”</p>
<p class="p1">Second, “providing speedy, accurate, and reliable service is an absolute necessity, and we’ve had really aggressive, guaranteed shipping times since the day we first started. This has been a challenge to maintain as we’ve grown from a three-man team in a garage into a fifty-person company with multiple distribution centers around the country.”</p>
<p class="p1">To solve for both of these issues and build processes that scale, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/man-crates-ecommerce-api-integrations/">the Man Crates team looked to BigCommerce’s APIs</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p3">The Problem</h3>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>25%</span></h3></p>
<p class="p2">Percent of custom orders as total of all orders.</p>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1"><em>As described by Sam Gong, Co-Founder at Man Crates to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p1">There&#8217;s the turnaround time for shipping, which is difficult. Then you combine that with personalized orders, which is something customers really value when you&#8217;re selling gifts. It’s especially challenging to scale these two customer perks hand-in-hand.</p>
<p class="p1">In the very first days of the company, we worked with TechShop. It&#8217;s one of those local makerspaces. You can go in and take a class and learn how to use a laser etching machine or any other machine, and then rent time by the day.</p>
<p class="p1">This is actually how we started doing personalized orders. We were renting time on these machines. It got to the point where this became the absolute slowest, worst part of the business.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, in the 2013 holiday season, we got to a couple days before Christmas and our working queue was just so backed up that we had to stop selling them, and then our laser team pulled heroic shifts. I think people got eight, 10 hours of –– well –– tons of overtime those weeks. They just kept the lasers running around the clock so that we&#8217;d ship out all the orders that we&#8217;d committed to ship out and then we had to stop sales because we didn&#8217;t want to promise somebody a Christmas gift that we weren&#8217;t able to deliver on time.</p>
<p class="p1">So, we asked ourselves, “Do we innovate, or do we get rid of these personalized orders, which we know customers like. Is it just such a drag on the business to try to keep producing these, and maintain our shipping times that we need to have to be a gift company?”</p>
<p class="p1">We looked around for solutions. Nothing. There may be a few other companies that have a private solution for this that they&#8217;ve developed in house the same way that we have, but when we were looking, we found nothing. This isn&#8217;t a common enough problem that there&#8217;s software on the market you can buy for this automating laser etching for personalized orders.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>But, our personalized orders make up 20-25% of our business. We had to figure out how to scale it.</strong></p>
<h3 class="p3">The Plan</h3>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>4000%</span></h3></p>
<p class="p2">Percent increase in revenue in 4 years.</p>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1"><em>As described by Sam Gong, Co-Founder at Man Crates to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p1">This innovation is really a couple super talented engineers and a genius named Jason Hall.</p>
<p class="p1">Jason is our resident Ron Swanson. He&#8217;s just the everyday, every-man handyman.</p>
<p class="p1">We said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to run a laser shop in the warehouse. Help us figure out how to do that.&#8221; And Jason was like, &#8220;OK, I&#8217;ll figure out how to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">So, Jason put in an order for six more of the lasers we were using. It was so many, the laser company sent a rep down to see what we were doing.</p>
<p class="p1">He then rewired the warehouse with higher voltage electricity that you need if you&#8217;re going to run these really big machines, and put in air ducts and built a whole ventilation system himself.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, we&#8217;ve got 16 lasers all plugged in to this system. Each laser can do 35 or 36 orders per hour. Over the holidays, when we&#8217;re in our really busy time, we&#8217;ve got shifts that trade off, so the machines are running 16, sometimes 20 hours a day, producing a ton of value for the business.</p>
<h3 class="p3">The Technology</h3>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>#4</span></h3></p>
<p class="p2">Fastest growing retailer in the U.S.</p>
<p class="p2"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1"><em>As described by Sam Gong, Co-Founder at Man Crates to Tracey Wallace, EIC at BigCommerce.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Today, as soon as we get a new order on the website, BigCommerce notifies our routing system via a webhook. We download all the information via BigCommerce&#8217;s API, and then the routing system passes that off to our manufacturing system&#8217;s internal API.</p>
<p class="p1">We just built the system so they could talk to each other much the same way that our systems talk to BigCommerce. Im real time, we&#8217;re passing data from BigCommerce into our manufacturing system. When we see an order come in with the SKU, we know that means we need to add a certain print file to the working queue. Then, based on the number of print files that we have for each type of product, the system assembles them into giant print trays.</p>
<p class="p1">These lasers are big. Picture half of a truck bed.</p>
<p class="p1">If you&#8217;re running one order at a time, your laser operator&#8217;s spending a ton of time opening up the machine, putting the new glassware in there so it can be etched, and then running one piece at if that&#8217;s how you&#8217;ve built your print files.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the big innovations the system has is it&#8217;s taking all of the orders we need to print and arranging those print files in single trays so the laser operator can just fill a jig with all the pieces they need to run all the orders. Then, the operator puts that jig in the laser, and hits print.</p>
<p class="p1">Step away for 45 minutes, and it&#8217;s all automatically laid out.</p>
<h3 class="p3">The Success</h3>

<h2 class="p1">Fit Online: Multi-Product Comparison Tool for Fitness Fanatics</h2>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most competitors regurgitate the manufacturer’s information in their stores. Our challenge was to stand out from the crowd.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">James Reeve, Founder and CEO at Fit Online</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">The fitness equipment industry is booming thanks to a cultural shift and new focus on exercise. Like athleisure, the fashion term for workout clothes, fitness equipment is seeing increasing sales from individual consumers as well as fitness startups –– i.e. CrossFit, Pilates, barre and yoga studios.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike athleisure, though, fitness equipment has technical requirements and differences, many of which are subtle and nuanced. Most fitness equipment brands use different terminology for the same technology as well as different information hierarchies. This makes it virtually impossible for consumers to compare products like-for-like.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://www.fitonline.com.au/" target="_blank">Fit Online</a>, a fitness equipment seller, took on the task of addressing this challenge –– rewriting all product descriptions into a proprietary format and configuring their website to allow for side-by-side comparison of up to four products at a time.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>This solved for the customer need –– giving site visitors a tool that a full 50% of customers use.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-18081" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fit-online.png" alt="fit-online" width="728" height="570" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fit-online.png 728w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fit-online-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p class="p1">On the backend, however, updating thousands of SKUs and product data sent in from manufacturers was a much bigger problem. Fit Online sought to create a system that would enable the team to scale their editing, writing and formatting needs.</p>
<p class="p1">Using the BigCommerce <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Setting-up-Customer-Groups">custom fields tab</a> to deliver product specifications rather than the usual WYSIWYG product description field, the team was able to transform the provision of product information from rambling and disjointed sentences into structured and standardized data.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, the Fit Online team identified 15-20 key attributes (i.e. horsepower, user capacity) for each product type (i.e. exercise bike, treadmill) and set up custom fields for each attribute.</p>
<p class="p1">This means that the specifications list for all products now have identical order, layout and definition.</p>
<p class="p1">“Most competitors regurgitate the manufacturer’s information in their stores. Our challenge was to stand out from the crowd and present product information in a standardized format which was able to be easily compared between models and fill a market void,” says James Reeve, founder and CEO.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;In an environment where the number of competitors has tripled in the last three years, we have increased our conversion and customer satisfaction ratings. We have built up a reputation in the industry for being ‘the place&#8217; to get reliable, comparable information, and customers frequently give feedback that our site has by far the clearest product comparison feature in the industry.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="p4">Hydro Empire: Bundling Options That Increase AOV 30%</h2>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We maximized the shop-ability of products through an add on tool we built and integrated on our shopping cart. This curated list of items are exactly what the customer needs and is not simply a glorified up-sell tool.</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Arny Pollack, Director of Operations at Hydro Empire</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">For many brands making more than $5 million through their webstore, the goal isn’t to bring in more traffic.</p>
<p class="p1">It is to sell more to those people already on your site.</p>
<p class="p1">After all, you already have their attention. Now, you just need to figure out how to convert them with the highest possible order value.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.hydroempire.com/" target="_blank">Hydro Empire</a>, the garden superstore, has figured out a way to do just that –– while also providing a holistic shopping experience to newcomers.</p>
<p class="p1">When buying gardening supplies, it’s rare that you only need one item. From potters and plants to gloves and shovels, gardening is an industry with naturally high product count orders.</p>
<p class="p1">However, not all products have a high margin. Customers can checkout with various products and still maintain a rather lower average order value. Plus, not all customers know exactly what they need for each project –– and few online consumers take the time to search an entire site looking for individual items.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Hydro Empire looked to solve this problem. The goal was to showcase a list of additional items curated by gardening experts alongside each product.  </strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What they built is a product page bundling tool –– allowing existing and prospective customers the ability to add all necessary items for a single project to cart while on a single page.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-18079" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hydro-empire.png" alt="hydro-empire" width="750" height="346" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hydro-empire.png 1433w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hydro-empire-300x139.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hydro-empire-750x346.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">“Notice we have a mix of items that have checkboxes to the left. If you look at the bottom of that list, you’ll see other items with buttons mixed with sizes. These are options with sizes,” explains Arny Pollack, Director of Operations.</p>
<p class="p1">“We built this custom so that people can choose their size, which is something unheard of in a standard up-sell feature.”</p>
<p class="p1">“For example, if you need to order gloves to go with your product, we are now able to let you select the size you need without having to leave the page and select that size the way traditionally it needs to be done.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">ICHIBAN Toys: How to Double Sales (Tip: Moving Abroad Required)</h2>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I discovered our products should be a passion and a way to show everything I&#8217;ve learned. Each new project should build upon the experiences of previous projects, working to resolve the weakest elements.</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Christopher White, Founder at ICHIBAN Toys</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">According to the internet, Albert Einstein defined insanity as “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”</p>
<p class="p1">To me, that sounds like a rut. Christopher White, founder of <a href="http://www.ichibantoys.com/" target="_blank">ICHIBAN Toys</a>, would agree.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2014, though his company was experiencing great growth and sales, White felt his product offering was missing choice quality LEGO pieces, among other things.</p>
<p class="p1">Solving for quality, though, was a task low on the priority list.</p>
<p class="p1">“My time was spent in producing more product, emails, admin and shipping, rather than designing new kits and working in the B2B market. My wife and I are the main part of the company, and then we get additional help when needed. I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to overcome this [lack of time] challenge.”</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Instead of ruminating on the issue, White decided to take matters internationally –– uprooting his life in the U.S. and heading to Kyoto, Japan.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The move forced White to make a significant business change –– and re-prioritize.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">He sold off all his inventory and began networking to learn how to build LEGO kits to the extraordinary perfection Japanese crafts are known for.</p>
<p class="p1">With a new environment, new tools and supplies all under his belt, White could spend more time building out his B2B services and creating new, high-quality LEGO kits that built on the innovation from the product series before it.</p>
<p class="p1">“I discovered that our products should be a passion and a way to show everything I&#8217;ve learned. Each new project should build upon the experiences of previous projects, working to resolve the weakest elements,” says White.</p>
<p class="p1">“Value comes from quality; not just from price. This change of thinking and perspective is what I think innovation is, and [to achieve that], it required me to surround myself with this different attitude toward a product.”</p>
<p class="p1">This change in thinking –– from quantity to quality –– affected White&#8217;s entire business. He has now upgraded to a new, responsive theme and relaunched the ICHIBAN website –– all in a single day. Because all BigCommerce themes maintain product data, variants and copy, there was no need to re-upload products or have any effect on already successful SEO efforts.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, though his B2B business is his main focus, ICHIBAN Toys still caters to a B2C audience, many of whom buy every single one of the company&#8217;s new product kits.</p>
<p class="p1">“Our B2B services have never been stronger. Our clients now say we are often the first company they go to for corporate gifts and tradeshow giveaways. They and our consumer customers are impressed with the higher quality products. Some of our customers buy every single new product we launch –– our kits are quite expensive! It&#8217;s encouraging to see that our customers find value in our kits,” says White.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that I have the right thinking in mind, I&#8217;m excited for ICHIBAN Toys to experience the fullness of our innovation when we move back to the U.S. from Japan and resume operation in the U.S. beginning in May 2017.”</p>

<p class="p1">As the world’s largest cycling brand, their team’s website requirements span the globe. Each country’s audience is a little bit different. Each segment (B2B versus B2C for instance) is a little bit more nuanced. Every change to a site a little more complex.</p>
<p class="p1">For years, Spinning.com used a custom solution to help them achieve world-class online store status, despite their complex needs. With consumer buying behavior shifting and their international customer list quickly expanding, a custom platform no longer made sense for the team. They needed an integrated solution that offered world-class marketing capabilities while accounting for their technical complications.</p>
<p class="p1">“Our previous solution supported growth across the commercial segment, but it’s proven to be limiting in allowing the business to expand its global footprint across the consumer ecommerce channel,” says Stewart Guest-Smith, VP of Digital and Strategy. “The need to efficiently service our consumers globally has become a key strategy for the business going forward. To support the increasing consumer demand across Europe, China, UAE, Latin America and Africa the business required an alternative, integrated platform.”</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>The goal for the team was scalability and efficiency was key. Here’s exactly what they did:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Built the ability to federate content to 20 stores globally through the use of an integrated Product Information Management (PIM) solution.</li>
<li class="p1">Leveraged the PIM to publish all types of content (blog, website, transactional and educational assets) in translated text through the use of a real-time API based translation service.</li>
<li class="p1">Utilized the PIM to connect to multiple ERPs, across two different settlement centers, and publish transactions in real-time.</li>
<li class="p1">Leveraged the architecture to provide federated login SSO/SAML to allow a seamless experience for customers across multiple products servicing purchasing, learning and events based services.</li>
<li class="p1">Utilized the newly developed payment solution to allow Spinning.com to service it’s global subscription membership program.</li>
<li class="p1">Leveraged a unique product to provide automation and workflow engagement of email, allowing the business to develop various workflow campaigns to drive conversions of transaction based emails.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For the Spinning.com team, the use of a SaaS ecommerce platform with a sophisticated PIM has streamlined business processes, creating a more efficient workflow for all site updates, warehouses, shipments and customers on the front-end.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>This is how you run a world-class, international business.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;This future-state solution provides a seamless and well-structured experience to our consumers. It allows us to extend our ecommerce landscape and service the demand across channels that have been previously well under-serviced,&#8221; says Guest-Smith.</p>
<p class="p1">“Strategically, the BigCommerce implementation provides direct top-line growth benefit and operationally will be more economical as an overall solution than our previous custom product.”</p>

<h2 class="p5">Wire N Cable: A Case Study in Going from $0 to $1M in Less Than a Year</h2>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Because of these roots to the industrial age, ecommerce for the wire and cable industry has been a slow moving, painful process. We set out to change that.</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Josh Heller, President and Owner at Wire N Cable</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">There are few industries that have been completely undeterred by the prevalence of ecommerce. In the wire and cable industry, however, ecommerce is a nonstarter. Customers still fax in orders, using a machine plenty of digital natives (i.e. millennials) wouldn’t even recognize.</p>
<p class="p1">There has been no change in how the industry sells for decades. It’s door-to-door or pick up the phone, leave a message and include your facsimile number.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><a href="https://wirencable.com/">Wire N Cable</a> set out to change that. In early 2016, the team launched an ecommerce website, unsure of the market’s willingness to buy online.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">For the first time in the industry, a single wire and cable retailer was using online loyalty programs, Google Shopping, SEO, Amazon, eBay and even a mobile app to drive a clientele base used to faxes and print catalogs to an online destination.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The results have been tremendous: $0 in online revenue to more than $1.1 million in less than 12 months.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">“We have thousands of positive comments and feedback stating how easy it is to use our site, and that’s all thanks to BigCommerce. I don’t want to forget to mention the speed of the site as well,” says Josh Heller, president and owner of Wine N Cables. “We utilize <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/name-your-price-pricewaiter/">PriceWaiter</a>, rewards, and many other features in the BigCommerce app marketplace. All of this brings an experience to a clientele base that is used to faxing in an order or getting mailed catalogs!”</p>
<h3 class="p4">Quick Stats</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">142,862 visitors from Google Shopping</li>
<li class="p1">23% conversion rate on traffic from Google Shopping, with an AOV of $232</li>
<li class="p1">1st page search results on Google for target keywords</li>
<li class="p1">$77,237.37 in revenue generated from <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/name-your-price-pricewaiter/">PriceWaiter</a> integration</li>
<li class="p1">$800,000 quoted out to customers via <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/quote-ninja/">Quote Ninja</a> integration</li>

<p>This past summer, <a href="http://www.exxel.com/">Exxel Outdoors</a>, the parent company to multiple outdoor brands including <a href="https://kelty.com/">Kelty</a> and <a href="https://sierradesigns.com/">Sierra Design</a>s, overhauled all seven of their websites simultaneously.</p>
<p>Changing one website is a large task, but seven is a massive initiative, but Exxel saw a trend that they wanted to get in front of as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This major driver and trend was the fact that 40% of their traffic was coming from mobile, but their conversion rates were low. Hardly anyone on smaller devices was checking out.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>Trend lines show more than 50% of traffic to websites today are from mobile devices, but 75% of sales are attributed to desktop.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>That number is actually just short of industry average. Trend lines show more than 50% of traffic to websites today are from mobile devices, but <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2016/How-Mobile-is-Transforming-the-Digital-Commerce-Landscape">75% of sales are attributed to desktop</a>.</p>
<p>This is both a UX and CRO issue, or as both we and Exxel view this, a UX and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization/">CRO opportunity</a>.</p>
<p>Exxel’s overhaul focused on the mobile experience and they saw huge wins immediately, but we’ll get to that in a minute.</p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>The Mobile Opportunity</h3></p>
<p>Driving new traffic is difficult and expensive, but Exxel Outdoors saw a huge mobile optimization opportunity to both create happier customers and make more money from their existing traffic – resulting in a 147% increase in mobile conversions.</p>
<p></div>
<h2>The State of Mobile</h2>
<p>In 2014, we passed the <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/">mobile tipping point</a>.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18502 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1.png" alt="mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1" width="550" height="405" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1.png 550w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1-300x221.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p>Millennials and Generation Z use their phones more than any other device to browse and shop online. Mobile digital media time in the U.S. is now significantly higher at 51% compared to desktop at 42%. Afterall, popular social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat don’t even offer a desktop experience.</p>
<p>In 2017, with Google’s <a href="http://searchengineland.com/faq-google-mobile-first-index-262751">mobile index update</a>, mobile will become the de facto indexing source for your website.</p>

<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>While mobile usage is increasing, surpassing all other devices, mobile spend and sales in retail is lagging behind.</p>
<p>Of the top reasons why consumers do not convert on mobile according to a ComScore study, all but one are issues of user experience and mobile-friendly <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/best-ecommerce-website-design/">website design</a> from landing page to checkout.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18695 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mobile-first-tipping-points.png" alt="mobile-first-tipping-points" width="612" height="377" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mobile-first-tipping-points.png 612w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mobile-first-tipping-points-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<h2>Increase Your Revenue with Mobile-Friendly Design</h2>
</div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>147%</span></h3><br />
Percent increase in mobile conversions for Exxel Outdoor brands since the mobile-first relaunch of the company’s seven websites.<br />
</div><div class="post-detail__body-inner">
<p>Today, Exxel Outdoors has seen a <a href="http://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/retail-success-stories/exxel-outdoors-doubles-mobile-conversion-across-seven-e-commerce-brands">147% increase in mobile conversions</a> since re-launch.</p>
<p>In addition to an increase in mobile conversions and revenue, they reduced their bounce rates, decreased page load time and reduced hosting costs.</p>
<p>The team credits their <a href="http://mattjanaway.co.uk/introduction-ecommerce-growth-hacking/">growth success</a> to many factors –– a mobile-optimized website, product videos on all product pages, turning product pages into responsive landing pages and streamlined checkout –– all of them targeting a mobile customer’s desired experience and intent.</p>
<p>Their goal was to be mobile-first, not just mobile-friendly.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18696 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kelty-product-page-mobile.jpeg" alt="kelty-product-page-mobile" width="392" height="867" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kelty-product-page-mobile.jpeg 392w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kelty-product-page-mobile-300x664.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Kelty is one of Exxel Outdoors&#8217; most successful brands. </em></p>
<p>Of course, Exxel Outdoors’ brands aren’t the only ones benefitting immensely from a mobile-first focus.</p>
<p>Online stores like <a href="https://www.awesomegti.com/">AwesomeGTI</a>, <a href="https://www.storeyourboard.com/">StoreYourBoard</a> and <a href="https://www.knobs.co/">The Knobs Co</a> have seen similar results from their mobile audiences. Each of these brands have focused on turning <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-video-strategy/">product pages into landing pages</a>. They use <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-product-videos/">video</a>, honest customer reviews, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-rock-product-photography-on-a-budget/">product photos</a>, social media streams and clear Add to Cart buttons to do this.</p>
<p>Their success on mobile is thanks to going beyond mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>This is a drastic change.</p>
<p>It’s time brands leave left-over desktop functionality that doesn’t make sense on a mobile device behind. It’s time to design online experiences for mobile before all else.</p>
<h2>Introducing the First Theme Built for Mobile First</h2>

<p></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner">
<p>BigCommerce is here to help.</p>
<p>Not every online store has the budget to hire developers and designers. And, even those that do often don’t have the time to A/B test concepts, or lay out all needs before hiring an agency or launching a new site.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve partnered with celebrity designer LaQuan Smith and design agency <a href="https://partners.bigcommerce.com/directory/partner/126594/pixel-union">Pixel Union</a> to launch the only fully customizable, mobile-first theme offered by an ecommerce platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/touch-clean/">Meet Touch</a>: an innovative combination of technical need and innovative UX.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/matuYHAwU60" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Touch is already being used by <a href="http://laquansmith.com/">the LaQuan Smith brand</a>, which has been optimizing for mobile first since early 2016. Among their mobile first experience updates are intuitive swipe left-right functionality, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> for quick checkout and high-quality images for familiar mobile app-like scanning and swiping.</p>
<p>“The Touch mobile-first design speaks so perfectly to my core customers, a large portion of whom are already making purchases on a mobile device. Touch just kicks the experience up a few notches by adding elements that improve that existing experience,” says Smith. “For starters the navigation, which relies on intuitive finger swipes to move between pieces of clothing, functions in much the same way that you would already use your phone.</p>

<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>“In my opinion, the coolest element of this theme is <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-checkout-page-optimization/">the seamless checkout experience</a>, which completely eliminates the frustrations we’ve all experienced when trying to check out on a mobile device,” says Smith. “Through Touch, customers can pay with a single touch using Apple Pay.”</p>

<h2>Apple Pay v. Chrome Mobile Checkout</h2>
<p>It is one thing to use a mobile-first site design and UX, but another to enable quick, convenient and trust-worthy checkout on mobile. Yet, as LaQuan mentioned, mobile checkout improvements like Apple Pay and PayPal One Touch are quickly decreasing mobile <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">abandoned cart rates</a>. Apps using Apple Pay since September of 2016 have already <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apple-pay/">increased conversion rates 2x</a>.</p>

<p>To understand exactly how mobile wallets and one-touch checkouts are doing this, just take a look at the time to checkout difference on OverStock.com between Apple Pay and a regular mobile checkout flow.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GWHYan1EweM" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><center><em>Apple Pay checkout flow in Safari</em></center><center></center><center></center><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C84X7OAFOA4" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><center><em>Mobile checkout flow in Chrome</em></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amount of time spent is vastly different. Apple Pay and similar solutions are leading the path to mobile checkout optimization, making it even more important for brands to create a mobile-first design that leads users to the optimized checkout.</p>
<p>After all, in 2017, retail will serve mobile audiences before all else. The time is now to make sure your site is ready. Updating to a mobile-first theme is a great step – especially if you are a retailer with higher volumes of traffic coming from mobile than desktop.</p>
<p>For brands which have yet to see mobile traffic surpass desktop, know that the time will come. Before then, be sure you are using a responsive theme and signaling to search engines like Google that your product pages are engaging (i.e. great product photography and video) and kept up to date with fresh content (i.e. customer reviews).</p>
<p>Mobile is no longer a choice. It is the new reality. And with it comes massive mobile revenue opportunities from your existing and future traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Stay tuned in 2017 for additional updates and more data on mobile conversions and the future of online shopping.</strong></p>

<p class="p1">Today, BigCommerce merchants can begin to sell to more than 165 million buyers worldwide through the industry’s first-ever <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ebay">native integration with the eBay marketplace</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>165M</span></h3></p>
<p class="p1">The number of worldwide buyers on the eBay marketplace.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">The era of <em>online shopping</em> versus <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/mobile-commerce-optimization-best-practices/"><em>mobile shopping</em></a> versus <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/multichannel-selling-online-marketplace-considerations-to-boost-sales/"><em>marketplace shopping</em></a> versus <em>webstore shopping</em> is over. Consumers want to shop <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">wherever and whenever is most convenient for them</a>. Add the always evolving algorithms and business strategies from marketing channels like Google and Facebook –– solutions of which drive heavy traffic to online stores –– and one thing becomes clear: sustainable online businesses must future-proof their brand while increasing consumer visibility.</p>
<p class="p1">To do that, the most successful brands are diversifying and launching additional sales channels on marketplaces, social media sites and through alternative business tactics like B2B or B2C.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">After utilizing BigCommerce&#8217;s marketplace integrations, we have generated an additional $100,000 a month in revenue.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Josh Heller, President and Owner at Wire N Cables</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">This is no small shift in how businesses are run. Launching additional sales channels has historically proved challenging –– requiring brands to start from scratch, re-upload large product catalogs and toggle between varying interfaces to manage their brand holistically.</p>
<p class="p1">No longer is that the case.</p>
<p class="p1">With the addition of eBay to the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/multi-channel-ecommerce/">BigCommerce Channel Manager</a>, an online store’s central omnichannel control center, consumers can now centralize inventory management and order processing, rapidly bulk list products with a click of a button and manage individual channel product content to optimize sales all from one interface.</p>

<p class="p1">“Our integration with eBay enables retailers to sell to the massive eBay community from a single platform unified with their branded websites,” said Brent Bellm, CEO of BigCommerce. “The eBay and BigCommerce partnership allows retailers to maximize their online sales while minimizing technical and operational complexity.”</p>
<p class="p1">With the release, BigCommerce is the only ecommerce platform to natively support selling across the world’s <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/bigcommerce-amazon-integration/">two largest marketplaces</a> and leading social platforms, including <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/new-tools-advertise-on-facebook/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/pinterest-buyable-pins/">Pinterest</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">Google is proud to announce the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/google-shopping/">new Google Shopping app</a> built by the Google team for BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p1">The app removes all complexity in setting up your <a href="https://www.google.com/retail/shopping-campaigns/">Google Shopping</a> feed. Automatically verify your business, setup your product feed, and start selling immediately with zero developer resources needed.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the first launch of a new Google product: ecommerce platform feeds. These feeds now connect directly to your store’s backend for increased product variant and price accuracy, reliability and marketing scalability.</p>
<p class="p1">The bottom line for ecommerce marketers is less time spent on setup and clean-up, and more time spent on optimization to increase sales.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Google Shopping is an Absolute No-Brainer for Any Ecommerce Business</h2>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Google Shopping is an incredibly cost effective way for us to reach new customers on long-tail search terms and recapture visitors that have found Man Crates through one of our primary marketing campaigns,” says Sam Gong, co-founder of <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/man-crates-ecommerce-api-integrations/">Man Crates</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">“It&#8217;s helped tens of thousands of customers find the gift they were looking for and contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue to our business. It&#8217;s well integrated with BigCommerce, incredibly easy to setup, and easy to measure and manage on an ongoing basis. It’s an absolute no-brainer for just about any ecommerce business.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Google Shopping is well integrated with BigCommerce, incredibly easy to setup, and easy to measure and manage on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Sam Gong, Man Crates</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">In the past, store owners or digital marketers had to dig through and edit HTML on their sites to provide Google the necessary domain verification that allows a store access to Google’s AdWords platform (under which Google Shopping exists).</p>
<p class="p1">Then, once the store was verified, the owner or marketer had to create an FTP feed of their products for the information to flow properly into Google’s Shopping engine.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>If either of these steps proved too difficult or time consuming, one of two things would happen:</em></p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">The owner or marketer would call upon a third party platform to list products for them –– costing the brand thousands of dollars.</li>
<li class="p1">The owner or marketer would simply not list their products on Google Shopping –– some 25% of merchants gave up in steps one or two of the previous experience.</li>

<p class="p1">“100% of people who install the app now will be able to set it up in two clicks,” says Anthony Guarino, Strategic Business Development at BigCommerce.</p>

<p class="p1">Google Shopping has tripled our revenue stream bringing in customers we never knew we could market to.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Peter Baseio, Organic Munchkin</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">“Google Shopping allows our products to be listed in a more natural format, increasing brand awareness for our niche market and increasing revenue,” says Peter Baseio, founder and CEO of Organic Munchkin.</p>
<p class="p1">“Emphasizing an image-based ad allows our product to skip the traditional methods and fortify our strengths through direct marketing. It has tripled our revenue stream bringing in customers we never knew we could market to. Since we already are listed high in Google search rankings organically, this allows us to target visually the top of the search rank as well.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="p3">Reliable &amp; Scalable: Why Google Sought Out BigCommerce’s Ecommerce API</h2>
<p class="p1">“We sought out BigCommerce because of their robust catalog API,” says James Summerfield, technical lead at Google. “The ability to sync large, complex catalogs to Google Shopping in a matter of minutes makes our integration with BigCommerce both reliable and scalable.”</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__callout post-detail__callout--left"><h3>BigCommerce Product Tours</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Every week, BigCommerce’s Solutions Engineers host a 30-minute demo of the BigCommerce platform. <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/rt/6572861094668613633">Sign up to see new products and integrations like this one in action</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">In November 2015, Google and BigCommerce began working together to build the most reliable and scalable ecommerce selling experience through Google Shopping. Google needed <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/ecommerce-api/">a robust API</a> to test a new hypothesis: online sellers need more accurate technology to eliminate the manual work behind creating a successful brand.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We sought out BigCommerce because of their robust catalog API.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">James Summerfield, Google</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">You’ve seen many of Google’s tests on this hypothesis play out over the course of the last year with their public emphasis on mobile optimization, local search superiority, and creating a more secure web with HTTPS.</p>
<p class="p1">Ecommerce platform feeds are the newest of Google’s efforts to better empower buyers and sellers of online goods. By connecting directly with the backend of a store, these feeds will be able to automatically pull the proper and most updated variants, price points, inventory levels and images for all goods from that site.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, creating such a feed was no easy feat. It required an extensive API, allowing for hundreds of calls per second with zero disruptions. Google found their solution in <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/api-architecture-performance/">BigCommerce’s V3 Catalog API</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">Today, BigCommerce becomes the first cloud-based commerce platform to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/amazon/">natively support selling on Amazon</a>, Facebook and Pinterest from a single interface.</p>
<p class="p1">During the past several years, we’ve seen thousands of <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-success-stories/">BigCommerce merchants adopt strategies to sell on Amazon</a> while continuing to grow direct sales through their online stores. This isn’t surprising: consumers shopping on Amazon are purchase-minded, many ready to use a one-click push of their mouse or smartphone to buy any given item.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s just smart business to consider Amazon a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-marketing-strategy/">primary sales channel for attracting new customers</a> — those that might not have otherwise encountered your brand or products.</p>
<p class="p1">As more BigCommerce merchants increase their presence on marketplaces, we’ve also received a greater number of requests to provide tighter integrations with Amazon seller services.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>We’ve heard you — and we’ve taken action.</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">Today, we’re excited to announce that BigCommerce has worked together with Amazon to make it easier than ever for our customers to sell on Amazon and take advantage of additional value-add services designed to help your business grow.</p>
<p class="p1">This integration has been almost a year in the making, as industry trends began making it clear that multi-channel selling is the most effective route to growth for mid-market businesses. Amazon is the first of multiple marketplace integrations on the roadmap, giving BigCommerce retailers easier access to the conversion-ready consumers who begin their product search on that marketplace.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Start Selling and Succeeding on Amazon Today</h3></p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce takes care of the backend technology, saving you precious time as you get started on Amazon. We&#8217;ve also compiled the advice of 30+ subject matter experts to walk you through how to sell your way to Amazon success. Read our free, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/selling-on-amazon/">definitive guide to selling on Amazon</a>.</p>

<h2 class="p3">List and Sell on Amazon from BigCommerce</h2>
<p class="p4"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17426" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sell-on-amazon-animation.gif" alt="sell-on-amazon-animation" width="750" height="437" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sell-on-amazon-animation.gif 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sell-on-amazon-animation-300x175.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Merchants can now review, edit and manage listings in BigCommerce’s Channel Manager as they could before within Amazon Seller Central. Inventory and orders from Amazon are synced in real-time with BigCommerce, providing a single source of truth and eliminating the risk of overselling.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few key features of the integration:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Publish Amazon listings from your backend</strong>, with streamlined error management and bulk listing capabilities, saving merchants with large catalogs hours per week. You choose the products you want to send with a click of a button –– or send your entire catalog.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Automatically sync inventory across your Amazon and BigCommerce selling points</strong>, removing any concern of overselling items and allowing you to use current fulfillment processes at your discretion.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Centralize your multi-channel management</strong> and maintain a single product catalog across various high-profit channels.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote">We wanted to be present wherever customers for our products like to shop. Selling on Amazon affords us the benefit of reaching millions of Amazon customers without spending the advertising dollars up-front.<div class="post-detail__quote-author">Seetha Singh, <a href="http://www.austinbazaar.com/" target="_blank">Austin Bazaar</a></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">In addition, merchants can edit, write and publish Amazon listing optimizations from their BigCommerce backend to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seo-strategy/">improve visibility in Amazon’s search engine, A9</a>. The vast majority of sales on Amazon happen through search and more than 70% of those sales come from page listings through Amazon search results.</p>
<p class="p1">Through Channel Manager, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Create custom product titles</strong> for your Amazon page in line with best Amazon search engine practices to increase ranking</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Edit product descriptions and add bullets</strong> to your listing for easier customer readability on Amazon</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Manage descriptions and price points</strong> for products pushed to Amazon without overwriting the descriptions and price points that work best on your own webstore</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote">Amazon&#8217;s been incredible for my business. I started selling on Amazon in October of 2015, and it&#8217;s doubled my sales. What that tells me is that there&#8217;s a whole slew of people who didn&#8217;t know I existed and they&#8217;d just go in to Amazon and type ‘hands-free pumping bra.’ It&#8217;s working way better than a Google search for me.<div class="post-detail__quote-author">Emily Ironi, <a href="http://shop.thedairyfairy.com/" target="_blank">The Dairy Fairy</a></div></div></p>

<p class="p1">More than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/">one billion people</a> sign on to Facebook every month, and today, BigCommerce is making it easier for merchants to more effectively reach people and sell more online.</p>
<p>BigCommerce is launching:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Pixel Installation:</strong> Easier Facebook pixel installation that does not require developer work on behalf of retailers. Marketers can now set up ads campaigns and go –– knowing their metrics are in place to report on performance.</li>
<li><strong>Checkout on Shop section on Pages:</strong> BigCommerce has expanded our support for the Facebook Shop section on Pages. Merchants can now let customers checkout directly on Facebook rather than redirecting back to a webstore. All Facebook orders are automatically synced with your online store, providing a single source of truth for inventory and orders across all your sales channels.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17324" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/facebook-checkout.gif" alt="facebook-checkout" width="750" height="477" /></p>
<p class="p1">“Social connections and online shopping are two of the most fundamental use cases for the internet. However, retailers historically have struggled to leverage the two in a way that makes sense for their customers,&#8221; said Jimmy Duvall, chief product officer for BigCommerce. &#8220;Through our work with Facebook, we’re helping our merchants both increase sales from Facebook advertising and reduce the time required to launch and optimize targeted campaigns.”</p>
<h2 class="p1">The Importance of the Facebook Pixel</h2>
<p class="p1">Facebook remains one of the highest traffic and revenue-driving channels for retailers in the U.S. –– and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-trends/">20% of online shoppers</a> report the desire to shop more on the platform.</p>
<p class="p1">This is good news for retailers, especially as Facebook amps up their advertising offerings. For instance, dynamic ads –– which are separate from Facebook Shop section on Pages  –– allow retailers to push product to Facebook and dynamically advertise those items to relevant, targeted audiences.</p>
<p class="p1">Beyond advertising reach, Facebook also provides retailers with detailed conversion metrics on what a person did on the retailer’s own website, including newsletter signups, add to cart and checkout. This provides necessary information to retailers about who exactly is coming to their site from Facebook ads, and what actions those visitors are taking.</p>
<p class="p1">Facebook is able to provide such detailed metrics thanks to the platform’s conversion pixel.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17326" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/facebook-bigcommerce.jpg" alt="facebook-bigcommerce" width="750" height="536" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/facebook-bigcommerce.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/facebook-bigcommerce-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">In early 2016, Facebook condensed a variety of pixels into one,  easing the process of pixel placement on a retailer’s website, something that often requires small amounts of development work.</p>
<p class="p1">Since then, Facebook has partnered with BigCommerce to streamline the pixel placement process, allowing merchants to install the Facebook pixel across their entire website without the need to manually enter or edit any code.</p>
<p class="p1">Once installed, merchants can launch and measure highly relevant, cross-device advertising campaigns using Facebook dynamic ads. Additional benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Launching more efficient and effective campaigns:</strong> Set up campaigns once and use unique creative to promote all products without the need to create individual ads or refine target audiences.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Optimizing campaigns:</strong> Automatically optimize campaigns toward audiences most likely to take actions you designate as most important to your business –– i.e. signing up for a newsletter or buying a product.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Improving conversion tracking:</strong> Accurately track actions that matter most to your website, including sales, registrations, leads, newsletter sign-ups, products added to carts and more to understand the ROI of Facebook advertising campaigns, and double down on what’s working.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Implementing advanced remarketing:</strong> Re-target shoppers that have visited your website, or find new customers using lookalike audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Facebook’s single pixel is most important for three advertising options often utilized by retailers. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Dynamic Ads:</strong> Advertise catalog products to shoppers browsing your website or mobile app. Use this with the Facebook pixel to measure the conversion rates for your ad.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Website Custom Audiences:</strong> Custom Audiences from your website makes it easy to reach people who visit your website and deliver the right message to them on Facebook.</li>

<p class="p1">Mobile commerce sales are expected to reach more than $123 billion in 2016, a 39% increase over 2015 and more than double the growth from 2014. In total, mobile commerce will account for nearly one-third of all retail ecommerce sales and 2.6% of total retail sales for the year.</p>
<p class="p1">The vast majority of these sales are occurring on smartphones, on which mobile commerce revenue saw a 95% year-over-year increase in 2015. <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mcommerces-Rapid-Growth-Primarily-Coming-Smartphones/1013909" target="_blank">eMarketer predicts</a> that the year-over-year growth of smartphone mobile commerce will slow to 50% in 2016, but absolute growth will be roughly the same: hitting $20 billion in additional sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay plays a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/apple-pay-tips-mobile-payments/">major role in this increase in mobile commerce conversion</a> and revenue by removing barriers to checkout. According to a Q1 2016 Forrester report, mobile traffic accounts for 44% of retailer traffic, but only 33% of online sales. Apple Pay has great potential for helping solve cart abandonment.</p>
<p class="p1">Specifically, <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/" target="_blank">Apple Pay</a> removes the need for consumers to manually enter or re-enter payment details on small screens. Instead, consumers can use the Apple Pay option and verify their identity using Apple’s TouchID fingerprint technology. When you make a purchase, Apple Pay uses a device-specific number and unique transaction code. So your card number is never stored on your device or our servers, and when you pay, your card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants.</p>
<p class="p1">“The single biggest challenge in mobile conversion stems from the difficulty of entering name, address, and payment details on a mobile device. Apple Pay on the web solves this problem by removing these steps. This eliminates friction and streamlines checkout, thereby saving sales that would otherwise be postponed or lost,” said Jimmy Duvall, chief product officer for BigCommerce. “By utilizing Apple Pay on BigCommerce stores, thousands of retailers will benefit from higher <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/conversion-optimization/">conversion rates</a> and provide their customers a best-in-class shopping experience.”</p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-17313" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/iphone.png" alt="iphone" width="458" height="640" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/iphone.png 458w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/iphone-300x419.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></center></p>
<p class="p1">Larger companies like WayFair and RetailMeNot are already seeing the upward revenue trajectory of mobile-ready consumers, and are preparing for a smartphone future.</p>
<p class="p1">“Over the past year we’ve seen consumers’ willingness to purchase on mobile increase a lot, to the point where the share of transactions taking place on the smartphone has doubled since late 2014,” Bob Sherwin, senior director of acquisition at ecommerce furniture company Wayfair, told eMarketer.</p>
<p class="p1">Tablets currently make up little more than half of all mobile commerce sales, but that is expected to change by 2017, when smartphones capture the majority of the market.</p>
<p class="p1">“Tablets are still growing but at a lesser extent than we’ve seen in the past,” Marissa Tarleton, CMO of North America at digital coupon marketplace RetailMeNot, told eMarketer. “As we partner with our retailers, we’re optimizing for smartphones.”</p>
<p class="p1">By 2020, smartphones will capture $129.44 billion of all retail mobile commerce outlays in the U.S., a growth rate of 18.3%. And smaller and mid-size brands should not be excluded from that share of revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">As mid-market brands continue to build their businesses and market to their target audiences, world-class on-site checkout experiences are mere customer expectations. BigCommerce will enable all growing brands on its platform the ability to offer their customers new, trusted technology that solves for frictioned experiences.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Stay tuned for more product announcements similar to <a href="http://bigcommerce.com/apple-pay/" target="_blank">Apple Pay</a> over the coming months as BigCommerce ramps up to provide a full <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">omnichannel suite</a> of tools to future-proof growing brands for the next wave of online business.</strong></em></p>
