After all, the sure fire sign of a healthy brand is a growing number of repeat purchases from already existing customers.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retention-rate.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21330" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retention-rate.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retention-rate.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retention-rate-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retention-rate-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>The above is a screenshot of BigCommerce’s out-of-the-box ecommerce analytics Customer report. You can clearly see the number of new vs. returning customers. A 50/50 split like the one above is a great place to be for a brand. And you can clearly see this particular brand is heavily focused on increasing returning customer spend. </em></p>
<p class="p1">This is because earn net new customers is expensive. It often takes advertising to acquire –– and if they don’t come back to purchase again, you’re return on ad spend stays steady, rather than increasing over time. It also means your customer lifetime value is low (which decreases how much you will be willing to spend on advertising –– and thus will limit your ad visibility).</p>
<p class="p1">Growing your customer lifetime value and building long term customer loyalty takes time, though. It can’t be created overnight.</p>
<p class="p1">It also isn’t rocket science.</p>
<p class="p1">Earning increased repeat business and building customer lifetime value is doable –– and you can start right now.</p>
<p class="p1">First, know that it takes business investment to make LTV a core and measured metric. It must be part of your overall business strategy. This isn’t about a monetary investment. No, you need to invest time in building ways to track and measure your LTV over time.</p>
<h2 class="p5">How 5 Brands Made Customer Lifetime Value a Business Priority</h2>
<p class="p1">There are many ways to build customer lifetime value, but first, let’s define it to make sure we are all on the same page.</p>
<h3 class="p6">What is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)</h3>
<p class="p1">Customer lifetime value, commonly referred to as LTV or CLV, is a business metric that estimates the total predictable repeat purchase rate of a customer over the lifetime of their time with your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">The higher your brand’s LTV (lifetime value) is, the more valuable it is considered in the market. This is because acquiring net new customers is expensive –– and if a customer only purchases from you once, your return on ad spend (ROAS) doesn’t increase over time.</p>
<h3 class="p6">How to Calculate Customer Lifetime Value</h3>
<p class="p1">Customer lifetime value informs nearly every business decision, but none more than ad and marketing spend.</p>
<p class="p1">First, you need to nail down the CLV that will be your north star. There are several ways to do this, but more importantly than which method you go with is consistency once that decision is made (for more on <a href="http://blog.ometria.com/how-to-calculate-customer-lifetime-value-clv-in-ecommerce">manually calculating CLV, Ometria</a> has an excellent tutorial).</p>
<p class="p1">If you are a BigCommerce customer, you can use your Analytics to download and then sort your customers by purchase date.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/clv.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21329" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/clv.png" alt="" width="640" height="323" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/clv.png 1155w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/clv-300x151.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/clv-750x379.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Easily configure customer lifetime value (LTV) by exporting your customer groups and viewing total spend with your company on a customer cohort level. You can even do it by each individual customer.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Better yet, if you are an Insights customer, you get immediate cohort access to customer LTV in a variety of reports.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acquisition-cost.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21328" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acquisition-cost.png" alt="" width="640" height="305" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acquisition-cost.png 1137w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acquisition-cost-300x143.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/acquisition-cost-750x357.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>BigCommerce Insights offers 6 LTV reports with easily downloadable cohorts you can use to target ads or emails to increase repeat purchasing rates, or find lookalike customers. </em></p>
<p class="p1">If you aren’t using BigCommerce, you can still get at this information by using your store analytics tool to download customer purchase and order history, and then match repeat customers. You may need to build out your own formula or combine multiple sets of data to get at your customer repeat purchase rate.</p>
<h3 class="p6">How to Use CLV — and Why it Matters</h3>
<p class="p1">CLV (or LTV) should inform nearly every business decision, but none more so than ad spend. The bang you get for your advertising buck is inextricably tied to what you can expect every customer to bring you in the long term — not just their first time purchasing from your store.</p>
<p class="p1">When you combine LTV <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-metrics/">with other metrics</a> like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies/">retention rate</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-is-customer-acquisition-cost-cac/">customer acquisition cost</a>, churn rate, net profit and ROAS, you start to get a very clear picture of what you can do to improve margins.</p>
<p class="p1">A low average ROAS will influence how much you spend on advertising –– likely meaning you won’t be able to afford to bring on net new customers at scale in the long run.</p>
<p class="p1">When you spend your business resources on an ad, the goal is to make sure that ad produces as much revenue as possible. Here’s a quick way to calculate ROAS:</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Gross Revenue from Ad campaign</strong></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">ROAS = _______________________</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Cost of Ad Campaign</strong></p>
<p class="p1">For example, a company that spends $2,000 on an online advertising campaign in a single month. In this month, the campaign results in revenue of $10,000. Therefore, the ROAS is a ratio of 5 to 1 (or 500%) as $10,000 divided by $2,000 = $5.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Revenue: $10,000</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Cost: $2000</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>ROAS = $5 OR 5:1</em></p>
<p class="p1">For every dollar that the company spends on its advertising campaign, it generates $5 worth of revenue.</p>
<h3 class="p6">What is a good ROAS?</h3>
<p class="p1">An acceptable ROAS is influenced by profit margins, operating expenses, and the overall health of the business.</p>
<p class="p1">While there&#8217;s no &#8220;right&#8221; answer, a common ROAS benchmark is a 4:1 ratio — $4 revenue to $1 in ad spend. Cash-strapped start-ups may require higher margins, while online stores committed to growth can afford higher advertising costs.</p>
<p class="p1">This is where LTV comes in. The higher your LTV is, the low your ROAS ratio can be for the short-term (understanding that the ratio will increase over time as the customer purchases additional items).</p>
<p class="p1">Some businesses require an ROAS of 10:1 in order to stay profitable, and others can grow substantially at just 3:1. A business can only gauge its ROAS goal when it has a defined budget and firm handle on its profit margins.</p>
<p class="p1">A large margin means that the business can survive a low ROAS; smaller margins are an indication the business must maintain low advertising costs. An ecommerce store in this situation must achieve a relatively high ROAS to reach profitability. In other words, if you have a low margin, LTV is more important to your business in order to achieve a higher ROAS ratio over time.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, let’s take a look at 5 brands who are using S Loyalty, among other tools and tactics, to build customer loyalty and repeat purchases –– two measurements of a healthy LTV.</p>

<p class="p1">The Cloud Alchemist is a boutique vapor liquid brand based out of Seattle, WA. They design and produce their own products, from initial design, down to laboratory production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">After speaking with Trevor Taylor, founder of The Cloud Alchemist, I learned that their customer loyalty strategy is all about being personable and connecting with their customers, as demonstrated by how frequently they engage directly with their customers to add value.</p>
<p class="p1">“I&#8217;ve talked with people about the birth of a new child, buying their first house, and losing jobs.</p>
<p class="p1">I gave store credit to a customer who&#8217;s hard up, sent spare hard drives to someone building computers for those in need, and even traded a t-shirt in exchange for someone&#8217;s home-made jerky.</p>
<p class="p1">This is not something you can fake, you have to be genuine, but the response to opening up and being human with customers is immeasurable.”</p>
<p class="p1">&#8211; Trevor Taylor, Cloud Alchemist</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">They’re active in their community, participating in Reddit groups, gatherings, Facebook communities, and more. Their team is always transparent about who they work for and where their biases lie. But, getting in front of potential customers as often as possible helps your brand to be seen as a thought leader and a helper –– making that customer’s next purchase decision more likely to be with you.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few other things The Cloud Alchemist does to increase customer lifetime value.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Send relevant, transparent emails</h3>
<p class="p1">A big part of being engaging is being relevant.</p>
<p class="p1">Being relevant doesn’t mean you have to send an individualized and personalized email to every single customer. Instead, it means that we set up your automation streams to address people by their given name (if your form collects it) and prompts them to take an action relevant to the action they’ve just taken on your site.</p>
<p class="p1">For instance, The Cloud Alchemist team emails new customers after a purchase, encouraging them to review the product for the vape community JuiceDB.</p>
<p class="p1">JuiceDB is a leading community review site for the vape industry, and The Cloud Alchemist makes it clear to customers that their review –– good or bad –– cannot be altered by their team. Instead, the brand is dedicated to making sure the best flavors have the highest reviews in the community, despite which ones those are.</p>
<p class="p1">After all, it helps to educate the entire industry.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s what that email looks like:</p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21326" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discount-rate.png" alt="" width="640" height="1585" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discount-rate.png 646w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/discount-rate-300x743.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">This is a great way for The Cloud Alchemist to get feedback, see what can be improved, improve customer satisfaction, and also gain exposure with public feedback that’s shared with the community.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Deliver a personal touch</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21325" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-1-300x400.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-1-750x1000.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">With every order that goes out, The Cloud Alchemist team includes a handwritten thank you message on their packing slips.</p>
<p class="p1">Included alongside stickers, cards, and other branded items, they take this opportunity to thank the customer personally for this business. After all, every customer has a choice, and their choice impacts your bottom line. If they choose to do with you, especially in a crowded industry, take that extra step to thank them for their time and prove your dedication to them as a customer. It will often be returned.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Reward customers for their loyalty</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21324" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-calculation.png" alt="" width="640" height="506" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-calculation.png 1554w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-calculation-300x237.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-calculation-750x593.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The Cloud Alchemist uses S Loyalty for their customer loyalty program solution. Like their approach to personalized emails, for their loyalty program, The Cloud Alchemist has turned on storefront notifications to showcase relevant reminders to shoppers about the loyalty program as they visit their site.</p>
<p class="p1">Enabling notifications has helped them with more consistent loyalty program engagement and has increased engagement outside of the segment of users that already engaging with the program.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s what Trevor had to say about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“There were a handful of customers that religiously used their points as they accrued them (mostly at the $10-20 reward mark), but this year we also turned on the email feature to remind customers that they had points to spend 14 days after earning enough to redeem.</p>
<p class="p1">It has been my personal impression that, since setting it up, we&#8217;ve had a marked uptick in returning customers using redeemed rewards and having those orders come through at a more regular and even pace (vs a tendency to have &#8220;hot&#8221; days where stacks of orders come in, generally on Fridays/paydays).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Each of these customer loyalty strategies builds customer lifetime value for The Cloud Alchemist. This is especially important in a crowded industry, where customers have a plethora of choices when it comes to where to purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Be sure to give your customers a feeling of personalization so that when they buy again, they buy from you.</p>
<h2 class="p7">2. How to Earn LTV Utilizing a Quality at Quantity Strategy</h2>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/relationship.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21323" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/relationship.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/relationship.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/relationship-300x190.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/relationship-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Super Hair Pieces is a direct-to-consumer hair piece store. Providing a wide assortment of styles, sizes, and colors, they have one of the largest inventories of hair pieces available online.</p>
<p class="p1">When I spoke with George Li about how they attracted a loyal following of repeat customers, it immediately became clear that their strategy is all about the product.</p>
<p class="p1">By delivering great hairpieces at the best possible prices, Super Hair Pieces has created a fighting force within the hair pieces industry.</p>
<p class="p1">The money they save with a lean strategy, they pass on to their customers. Here’s how it works.</p>
<h3 class="p8">Lower prices for increase loyalty</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21322" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/what-is-ltv.png" alt="" width="640" height="501" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/what-is-ltv.png 1556w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/what-is-ltv-300x235.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/what-is-ltv-750x587.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">When a new potential customer comes to your site, it is better that they come at the recommendation of a friend rather than through an ad.</p>
<p class="p1">Why?</p>
<p class="p1">Because social proof is incredibly valuable, and people believe that brands they are recommended to are better than others –– often even if they aren’t.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are <a href="http://blog.accessdevelopment.com/customer-loyalty-statistics-2016-edition">a couple stats</a> for you to chew on:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">People are 4x more likely to buy something when recommended by a friend</li>
<li class="p1">67% of consumers modify the brands/companies they purchase from in order to maximize points.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Added both of those stats up –– and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-set-up-a-loyalty-program-and-increase-customer-lifetime-value-more-than-150/">getting a loyalty program up and running for your business</a> can mean serious $$$.</p>
<p class="p1">Super Hair Pieces implemented a loyalty program two year ago. The savings that George can offer through points and rewards encourages customer retention, as well as referrals, and allows the brand to focus on delivering what they do best (selling a great product as an affordable price).</p>
<p class="p1">Today, a healthy part of Super Hair Pieces’ customer base are loyal, repeat customers –– all without any major marketing campaigns.</p>
<h2 class="p7">3. How a Niche Brand Makes Gains on Industry-Wide LTV</h2>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21321" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-1.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-1-300x190.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-1-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Swiss Rasoi is an online specialty grocery store that sells Indian spices and ingredients. They’re based in Switzerland and serve the Swiss market with free delivery, and a vast selection of spices and staples needed for Indian cuisine.</p>
<p class="p1">They’ve created a colorful brand filled with quality images that reflect their product offerings –– i.e. Quality ingredients. This brand design is consistent across their online store, as well as, their social media channels, helping to reinforce a consistent, trustworthy message.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s are <a href="http://blog.accessdevelopment.com/customer-loyalty-statistics-2016-edition">a couple more stats</a> for you:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">83% of consumers say loyalty is driven primarily by trust</li>
<li class="p1">26% of consumers mention the terms “trust” and “consistency” as an important element of brand loyalty</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Swiss Rasoi offers traditional products delivered right to your doorstep. With added conveniences like free delivery, unbeatable prices, and access to hard-to-find ingredients, they’ve created a brand where an increasing number of their customers come back to buy more.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Beautiful, resonating content for their community</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21320" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="422" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-2.png 856w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-2-300x198.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/customer-lifetime-value-2-750x495.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The Swiss community for authentic Indian spices and ingredients <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/find-product-niche-start-selling-online/">might have started as a small niche</a>, but Swiss Rasoi is creating brand recognition throughout the Swiss food industry. By delivering their color branded images which reflect their offerings, they create content that’s immediately recognizable with clear callouts.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition, every month, Swiss Rasoi hosts flash sales you can only find on their social media channels –– specifically Facebook.</p>
<p class="p1">By offering discounts on their already great prices, flash sales create an urgency for their customers to come back, make more purchases, and add to the brand’s overall LTV value.</p>

<h3 class="p6">More savings for loyal customers</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21319" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="502" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-2.png 1552w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-2-300x235.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ltv-2-750x589.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">In addition to offering their customers savings from offers and flash sales, Swiss Rasoi a loyalty program to give their best customers another avenue for saving on their quality ingredients.</p>
<p class="p1">When free shipping and low prices are standard, offering additional discounts through a loyalty program is something extra that Swiss Rasoi can give back to their loyal customers.</p>
<p class="p1">The more your purchase, the less you pay.</p>
<h2 class="p7">4. How to Play on the Power of Convenience for Increased LTV</h2>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21318" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-300x190.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Based in New Jersey, DBDPet became the largest dry goods vendor at reptile shows after just 6 years in business.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a classic startup story: they started in a garage with one bearded dragon that laid eggs. Now they are expanding beyond a 5,000 sq ft warehouse by breeding exotic animals, and offering supplies for every kind of pet.</p>
<p class="p1">DBDPet realized, however, that it was difficult to explain where to buy supplies for the pets they sold. Today, they strive to be a one-stop shop for all reptile supplies while providing accurate and useful information about the nurturing and care for these pets.</p>
<p class="p1">For DBDPet, their path to customer loyalty was built from their expertise and the steady stream of advice and content they deliver to their community.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Offering expert advice through social media</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21317" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="352" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-1.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-1-300x165.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-1-750x413.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-1-1596x881.png 1596w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Customers that shop at DBDPet come for the supplies, but stay for the advice and knowledge.</p>
<p class="p1">Social media became a way for Buddy and his team to spread their wisdom learned through years of experience in exotic pets.</p>
<p class="p1">They create a constant stream of content for Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, which are essential for them to keep their current customers engaged, while helping to reach new ones.</p>
<h3 class="p6">A loyalty program for a one-stop shop</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21316" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="719" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-2.png 1092w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-2-300x337.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-2-750x842.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">As DBDPet became a one-stop shop for exotic pets, their knowledge and expertise became the foundation of their customer loyalty strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">By offering a broad range of products, they cater to every need of their customers. You can say they are the Amazon of exotic pet supplies –– and we all know how loyal Amazon shoppers are.</p>
<p class="p1">DBDPet uses a loyalty program to further encourage customers to who their one-stop shop for all exotic pet and pet supply needs.</p>
<h3 class="p7">5. Florida Colors Nursery</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21315" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-3.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-3-300x190.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-3-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Florida Colors Nursery is a staple in the Plumeria community. Currently offering more than 1,200 varieties, many of which are their own, they also focus on providing extensive knowledge on growing, grafting, and cultivating Plumeria plants.</p>
<p class="p1">I briefly spoke with Tex Norwood, and it’s obvious that he and his team are fanatics about Plumeria flowers. Their customer loyalty comes from their thought leadership in the shared community around these flowers.</p>
<h3 class="p6">More than a thousand varieties shared on social media</h3>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21314" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4.png" alt="" width="640" height="368" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4.png 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4-798x457.png 798w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4-300x173.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4-750x432.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-4-1596x914.png 1596w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Alongside multiple properties about Plumeria, Social Media has been a primary outlet for sharing the beautiful photos of these plants. With so many colors, combinations, shapes, and sizes, each one is best cared for a little differently than the next.</p>
<p class="p1">They’ve built a loyal following by sharing their latest cultivations, while providing best practices on how to care and keep them healthy. In total, they have thousands of followers within their community engaged with their Facebook page, community websites, and store.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s immediately obvious that Tex and his business partners are experts when it comes to Plumeria. Customers can find an endless bucket of wisdom and knowledge to best grow, graft, cultivate, and enjoy these flowers.</p>
<p class="p1">As for their loyalty program, customers are rewarded each time they buy, adding up to store credit and lower overall cost for the customer (plus great social referrals for the brand).</p>
<p class="p4"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-5.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21313" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-5.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-5.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-5-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/build-customer-lifetime-value-5-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p7">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">These five stores each have a different approach to customer retention and customer loyalty –– ultimately leading to increased LTV –– which proves that there’s no one right way of keeping your customers engaged.</p>
<p class="p1">However, the one thing that all of these have in common is that they offer something that resonates well with their customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Whether that’s a wealth of expertise, affordable prices, or being passionate and personable; the lesson here is to treat your customers well, and they’ll return the favor.</p>

<p class="p1">My answer?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-ads-tips/">Invest in local Facebook ads</a>, and then retarget, retarget, retarget.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">. . . and then comes the inevitable question.</p>
<p class="p1">“But how?!”</p>
<p class="p1">Like most marketing efforts, the recipe for success isn’t a sexy, breakthrough tactic. You’re not one counterintuitive “growth hack” away from 100x ROI.</p>
<p class="p1">People often focus purely on creating their remarketing campaigns and placing retargeting pixels, then assume they can set and forget. Make no mistake — you can shoot yourself in the foot by not creating the right strategy from the get-go.</p>
<p class="p1">But in my experience, the secret to effective retargeting campaigns is careful management, analysis, and optimization.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not easy, but there are some basic principles you can follow to avoid the landmines frequently stepped on by marketers of every ilk.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>But first of all….</strong></p>
<h3 class="p3">What is retargeting?</h3>
<p class="p1">Retargeting is a cookie-based technology that displays custom advertisements to visitors who leave an online store without purchasing or performing another desired action.</p>
<p class="p1">Expansive third-party ad networks, such as Facebook and Google Display Network, enable ads to be displayed across the web, reminding customers of products they viewed or added to cart.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that we’ve officially defined it, let’s explore the following –– and unbelievably common –– mistakes, so you can learn what not to do before diving into your retargeting efforts.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Mistake #1. Segmentation</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>You’re targeting the default “All Visitors” audience.</strong></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21258" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-1.png" alt="retargeting campaigns" width="640" height="95" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-1.png 926w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-1-300x45.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-1-750x112.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of All Visitors audience in AdWords</em></p>
<p class="p1">Different customers came to the site for different reasons. They visited different pages. The pages they visited represent different intents.</p>
<p class="p1">Lumping all these customers into one group is a big mistake.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’re treating all your customers like they’re one demographic, you’re lacking something called <em>segmentation.</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">Mistake #2. Recency</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>You’re using the default 30-day cookie window.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Not every site has a stereotypical 30-day buyer path. The conversion path varies greatly depending on the website, product type, and industry.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at the path length for two of our clients. Both are ecommerce companies, but they focus on different verticals. You’ll notice that the first company has a longer conversion path than the second company.</p>

<p class="p1">By using the default 30-day cookie window, you’re either:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Wasting your budget</strong> by serving too many ads to customers who have a short conversion path, or</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Limiting your opportunity</strong> to buyers who have a long conversion path.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">By using a 30-day time window, you’re <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/online-brand-strategy/multichannel-strategies/underestimated-growth-pattern-ecommerce-companies-rfm-model/">throwing fish back into the pond</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Mistake #3. Frequency</h2>
<p class="p1">Another critical mistake:<strong> you have no ad frequency limit.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">InSkin Media<a href="http://www.inskinmedia.com/blog/infographic-environment-matters-improving-online-brand-experiences/"> studied U.S. consumer emotions</a> associated with retargeting ads and determined that ad frequency had a negative impact on buyer emotions.</p>
<p class="p1">Heavy ad frequency changes a buyer’s outlook from positive to creeped out. It can be intrusive, annoying, and worse yet &#8212; it may cause customers to become angry with your brand.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/facebook-ad-frequency.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21255" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/facebook-ad-frequency.png" alt="retargeting platform list" width="640" height="269" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/facebook-ad-frequency.png 700w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/facebook-ad-frequency-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>The negative impact of high ad frequency (via<a href="http://www.inskinmedia.com/blog/infographic-environment-matters-improving-online-brand-experiences/"> InSkin Media</a>)</em></p>
<p class="p1">As you can see, the more a customer interacts with a particular ad, the less likely they are to buy the product featured in the ad.</p>
<p class="p1">If you have no ad frequency limit, you’re basically waving a flag with your brand’s logo on it in your customer’s faces, blowing an airhorn in their ear, and tying their shoes together. One or two well-placed billboards along their morning commute would suffice.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Mistake #4. Creative</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>Using the same boring creative assets across the board.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Think about it &#8212; if you have one static ad displayed across all channels you’ll induce “banner blindness” — especially without a frequency limit in place. It’s saturation, plain and simple. You’re showing your ads too much, and suddenly people just stop seeing them.</p>
<p class="p1">Customers will ignore your ad the same way you ignore the speed limit signs on your home street. You know what the sign says, has always said, and you presume to know what it’ll always say. Don’t bury your ads in plain sight.</p>
<p class="p1">According to an Infolinks study,<a href="http://www.infolinks.com/blog/infographic/the-banner-blindness-infographic/"> 86% of U.S. consumers</a> suffer from “banner blindness.”</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/banner-blindness.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21254" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/banner-blindness.png" alt="custom audience" width="640" height="341" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/banner-blindness.png 874w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/banner-blindness-300x160.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/banner-blindness-750x399.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">The numbers put ad blockers in a wholly separate territory than your usual internet trend. This isn’t colored browsing tabs &#8212; it’s WordPress all over again. A significant portion of the entire internet are using those services, and that’s only going to intensify as time goes on.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at the visual below. In a short few years (this dataset reaches back to 2014), ad blockers have skyrocketed in popularity:</p>

<p class="p1">In a word, it means you’ve got to make your ads count. They’re getting less play from customers everywhere, and it’s up to you to intelligently make use of the time and attention they do get.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Mistake #5. Magic Bullets</h2>
<p class="p1">You spend time looking for a <strong>“magic bullet”</strong> in marketing blogs, podcasts, webinars, and courses instead of putting your head down, and executing on proven ideas.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll never get it right the first time, and that shouldn’t be discouraging. Practice makes perfect. If it were that easy, everyone would opt for these magic bullet strategies.</p>
<p class="p1">No magic bullet tactic can, or will, make your business successful. I feel so strongly about it, I have a saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Magic Bullets are for losers. Execution is key.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Marketing is about developing a clear strategy, and executing it systematically.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll need to do the hard work yourself. You’ll have to test, learn, and test some more until you know exactly what to offer to your market.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://conversionxl.com/working-hard-doesnt-matter-if-you-dont-know-what-youre-doing-rant/">Peep Laja from ConversionXL</a> agrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Everybody wants wins, but nobody wants to do the hard work of doing proper conversion research, actually figuring out what matters and developing a systematic approach.”</p>

<h2 class="p7">So, What Does it All Mean? A Note on Granular Ad Campaigns [+ a Framework!]</h2>
<p class="p1">So, we just looked at a few mistakes that are causing your ads to become too general, too frequent, or too annoying. You’re probably not sure exactly where things are going wrong.</p>
<p class="p1">U.S. consumers want brands to be useful, and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-personalization/">they want their experiences personalized</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, data from MyBuys’<a href="https://www.websitemagazine.com/blog/consumers-demand-personalized-shopping-experiences"> 7th Annual Personalization Report</a> revealed that consumers overwhelmingly prefer to purchase from retailers who:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Suggest products based on their browsing or buying behavior (53%)</li>
<li class="p1">Personalize online ads that promote offers and products from websites they visited (49%)</li>
<li class="p1">Show <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting/">personalized ads in social media feeds</a> (33%)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The bottom line is this: consumers purchase and engage more when they receive a truly personalized shopping experience in a consistent, coordinated fashion.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personalized-retargeting-campaigns.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21252" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personalized-retargeting-campaigns.png" alt="real-time bidding" width="640" height="388" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personalized-retargeting-campaigns.png 809w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personalized-retargeting-campaigns-300x182.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personalized-retargeting-campaigns-750x455.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>7th Annual Personalization Report (via<a href="https://info.magnetic.com/7th-annual-report-on-consumer-personalization.html"> MyBuys</a>)</em></p>
<p class="p1">To personalize your customer’s shopping experience, you need to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">How buyers use your website</li>
<li class="p1">What their pain points are</li>
<li class="p1">How to address those pain points</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Once you know those things, you can become granular. You can personalize your ad experience based on your store.</p>
<p class="p1">Be forewarned &#8212; when you go granular and start growing your campaigns, things get messy. Tactics will change, and so will the platforms. Don’t panic. It’s about staying consistent.</p>
<p class="p1">So, how do you stay consistent?</p>
<p class="p1">The framework of your campaign is the holy grail of consistency. It’ll help you systematically adapt your approach for any industry.</p>
<p class="p1">See the example below:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-5.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21251" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-5.png" alt="email retargeting" width="640" height="164" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-5.png 1050w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-5-300x77.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-5-750x192.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Retargeting Matrix Example via<a href="https://www.scubemarketing.com/blog/retargeting-matrix"> SCUBE Marketing</a></em></p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a breakdown of what you’re looking at in the above visual:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">We’re targeting buyers in the “Product Page Visitors” segment. It includes people who <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">abandoned a product page</a> before adding anything to their cart. I call this whole sheet a “Buyer Segment.”</li>
<li class="p1">This Buyer Segment is broken down into 3 Recency Segments, which are based on how recently each customer interacted with the Buyer Segment. Recency Segments are clearly visualized for ease of understanding.</li>
<li class="p1">Each Buyer Segment and Recency Segment have corresponding hooks, each of which serve to portray the essence of the ad.</li>
<li class="p1">Buyer and Recency Segments are running on Facebook Advertising and AdWords channels. Both channels have consistency.</li>
<li class="p1">Finally, the respective Targeting and Exclusion audiences are presented and mapped to each segment for easy implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The strategy for this segment is pretty clear. This visual is a snapshot of a<a href="https://www.scubemarketing.com/blog/retargeting-matrix"> Retargeting Matrix framework</a> I developed.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Learn More About RFM Models and How to Implement One for Your Business</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Did you know you can use BigCommerce Analytics to build an RFM model? <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/rfm-model/">Here’s exactly how to do it.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p7">The Retargeting Matrix Framework</h2>
<p class="p1">I’ve covered the Retargeting Matrix framework in<a href="https://www.scubemarketing.com/blog/webinar-recap-retargeting-matrix-a-framework-i-bet-you-havent-thought-about"> blogs</a>,<a href="http://www.unofficialshopifypodcast.com/episodes/59098-the-remarketing-matrix-10x-your-remarketing-campaigns-with-this-procedure"> podcasts</a> and<a href="https://www.semrush.com/webinars/retargeting-matrix-a-framework-i-bet-you-havent-thought-about/?language=en"> presentations</a>. The framework helps you systematically plan, implement, and scale retargeting campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">It forces you to approach your campaigns strategically, and it presents the plan in an easily-understood format.</p>
<p class="p1">The Retargeting Matrix represents 4 levers:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Buyer Segments</li>
<li class="p1">Recency Segments</li>
<li class="p1">Hooks</li>
<li class="p1">Channels</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Here’s how you can apply that to your campaigns.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Lever #1. Buyer Segments</h3>
<p class="p1">It all starts with Buyer Segments.</p>
<p class="p1">Segmentation is an old trick, and it’s still popular in marketing for a reason &#8212; it can be a strong contributing factor to better campaign ROI.<a href="http://www.emailmonday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/National-client-email-2015-DMA.pdf"> Direct Marketing Association</a> attributes 77% of ROI to segmented, targeted, and triggered campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">In the context of retargeting, I’m referring to segments based on URLs your buyers visit. Why does that matter? People visiting different URLs have a different intent.</p>
<p class="p1">Each segment has a different behavior, and they need to be marketed differently. Your Retargeting Matrix will have a tab with details on each Buyer Segment. You’ll have a clear picture of what each segment is, what their objectives are, and you’ll know how to market to buyers in each of those segments.</p>
<p class="p1">See the example below:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-6.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21250" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-6.png" alt="retargeting strategy" width="640" height="177" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-6.png 1086w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-6-300x83.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-6-750x208.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">If you are a BigCommerce customer using Insights, you can get similar information from your “Views But Did Not Purchase” report.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-7.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21249" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-7.png" alt="" width="640" height="390" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-7.png 1140w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-7-300x183.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-7-750x457.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p9">How To Create Buyer Segments</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>First, define an intended buyer path on your website.</strong> This is critical.</p>
<p class="p1">Name the Buyer Segments based on intent. The number of segments you can capture on your website depends on the complexity of your website.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about a simplified version of the buyer’s journey as it applies to visitors to your site:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-8.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21248" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-8.png" alt="" width="640" height="129" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-8.png 940w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-8-300x60.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-8-750x151.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Simplified Buyer’s Journey</em></p>
<p class="p1">Based on the example above, you have a few different Buyer Segments:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Home page visitors</li>
<li class="p1">Product page visitors</li>
<li class="p1">Abandoned cart visitors</li>
<li class="p1">Recent customers</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><strong>Next, group website URLs into different Buyer Segments.</strong> The buyers will self-identify what segment they belong to based on the pages they visit.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Third, understand minimum segment granularity</strong> by adding up the 30 day traffic for all URLs in each Buyer Segment. Find the Landing Pages report in Google Analytics by navigating to Behavior -&gt; Site Content -&gt; Landing Pages.</p>
<p class="p1">This is important!</p>
<p class="p1">Every retargeting channel has a minimum audience size, which will directly affect how granular you can get. If you create segments that don’t meet the minimum requirements, your ads won’t be served. Your only alternative would be to get more traffic to these buyer segments.</p>
<p class="p1">See the screenshot below:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-9.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21247" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-9.png" alt="" width="640" height="392" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-9.png 804w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-9-300x184.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-9-750x459.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Landing Pages Report in Google Analytics</em></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Finally, set an objective and an intended action for each Buyer Segment.</strong> The easiest way to do this is to take each segment, define what users are doing on your site, and add your goals for them (what you want them to do).</p>
<h3 class="p3">Lever #2. Recency Segments</h3>
<p class="p1">Your buyers have different urgency depending on their recency. That’s because buyer intent progresses over time, as users make their way through your funnel. Some users will go from 0 to 100 quickly, but by and large, there’s a “getting to know you” process.</p>
<p class="p1">The next step is to break down your Buyer Segments into Recency Segments. Each Buyer Segment will be broken down into further segments based on the last visit to that segment.</p>
<p class="p1">In the example below, the Decision segment visitors are broken down into 3 groups:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">0 &#8211; 30 days</li>
<li class="p1">31 &#8211; 60 days</li>
<li class="p1">61 &#8211; 90 days</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p9">How To Create Recency Segments</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>First, define segment depth.</strong> How deep and granular you can get? It depends on two things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your traffic over a 30 day period in the segment (see minimum granularity above)</li>
<li class="p1">The length of your customer’s journey</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Let’s explore the customer journey, as it’s very relevant to this topic.</p>
<p class="p1">Customer journey varies by industry, size, and business type. In the chart below, I mapped the customer journey for medium-sized businesses in the shopping industry using Google’s customer journey mapping tool.</p>
<p class="p1">Notice that you need up to 5 touch points before influencing a buyer to purchase:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-12.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21244" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-12.png" alt="" width="640" height="306" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-12.png 644w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-12-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>The Customer Journey to Online Purchase via<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/tools/customer-journey-to-online-purchase.html"> ThinkWithGoogle</a>.</em></p>
<p class="p1">To determine the customer journey for your own store, <strong>use the Path Length report in Google Analytics.</strong> It will show you exactly how many interactions your buyers take before converting.</p>
<p class="p1">In the example below, 69% of first-time interactions lead to conversions, and 25% of customers needed between two and four interactions. This is your opportunity for retargeting intelligently.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-13.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21243" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-13.png" alt="" width="618" height="415" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-13.png 618w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-13-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Path Length Report in Google Analytics</em></p>
<p class="p1">Now, let’s get to the recency. The <strong>Time Lag Report</strong> in Google Analytics reports on how many days your buyers take to convert. This report is similar to the Path Length report, but it’s measured in days.</p>
<p class="p1">The example below shows that the conversion window on the site is fairly short, since 86% of visitors convert the same day they make their initial visit. If you’re seeing data like this, it means you probably don’t need granular audiences requiring months of retargeting.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-14.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21242" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-14.png" alt="" width="640" height="268" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-14.png 936w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-14-300x126.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-14-750x314.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Time Lag Report in Google Analytics</em></p>
<p class="p1">Next, <strong>define your Recency Segments</strong>. By knowing the depth of your customer journey and traffic, you’ll also know how to break up your Buyer Segments into more granular Recency Segments.</p>
<p class="p1">The reason we break everything down by time is urgency. Urgency goes down with time, and your objective is to adjust your ads based on recency.</p>
<p class="p1">Some of your buyers will move from one Buyer Segment to another, progressing ever-closer toward a purchase. Some will remain in one segment longer. Everyone’s different.</p>
<p class="p1">Recency Segments will help you move these buyers from their initial segments into the next. You’ll be able to create ads tailored to the individual intent of not only Buyer Segments, but Recency Segments, too.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>A Stroke of Advertising Genius</h3></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Lever #3. Hooks</h3>
<p class="p1">Once you have the Buyer and Recency Segments figured out, you can perform customer research. This will allow you to discover a segment’s intent, and it’ll help you develop appropriate hooks (a.k.a. ad angles) for each segment.</p>
<p class="p1">Jay Conrad Levinson<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234202"> defines a hook</a> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“a tease, a sample, and a mental appetizer. The hook should give your prospects just enough taste to leave them wanting more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">In the example below, we have a dedicated hook for the respective Buyer and Recency Segment.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-15.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21241" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-15.png" alt="" width="640" height="168" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-15.png 1066w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-15-300x79.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-15-750x197.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Retargeting Matrix Example </em></p>
<h3 class="p9">How to Create Hooks</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>First, you need to understand the pain points of your buyers.</strong> You can’t accomplish this without performing customer research.</p>
<p class="p1">Your customer research will fuel your hooks for each segment when creating retargeting campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">How do you find out what your customers want? I’ve covered customer research in detail in my article about<a href="https://www.scubemarketing.com/blog/how-to-win-with-facebook-ads-when-you-dont-have-a-big-ad-budget"> Facebook Ads</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">I recommend starting with four methods and tools:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Method #1. Customer Review Sites</li>
<li class="p1">Method #2. Live Chat and Help Desk Logs</li>
<li class="p1">Method #3. Customer Survey</li>
<li class="p1">Method #4. On-Page Surveys</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">They will reveal a great deal of useful information you can act on.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Second, develop hooks for different segments.</strong> Different buyers are in different frames of mind. To have effective retargeting, you have to know what they want, and you have to communicate it to them in their words.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about the decision process, and the pain points of each segment (hopefully your research has revealed that).</p>
<p class="p1">Using that information, you can develop hooks to engage with each audience and address their pain points. Your objective doesn’t change &#8212; you need to be proactive, and you need to help your customers through the process with gentle nudges.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>8 Business Principles to $5M in Revenue</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Following the crowd rarely gets you anywhere. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/business-principles/">why staying true to your principles matters</a> –– especially in business.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p1">Example: Shopping Cart Segment, Issue: Trust</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">69% of shopping carts</a> are abandoned (based on 37 different studies). I’ll explore this segment as a result.</p>
<p class="p1">Any number of things can impact a shopper’s online experience. Even taking for granted how popular and widespread online shopping has become, it’s a given that we behave differently from one another when making our purchases. If we didn’t, there’d be no such thing as remarketing campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">Any number of things push or pull us in different directions when shopping online. Our decisions are easily influenced. While there’s still some mysteries to solve, we know plenty about these factors to make actionable decisions.</p>
<p class="p1">The factors that carry the most influence over shopping behavior include <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">speed of delivery and order fulfilment, brand reputation, and shipping costs</a> &#8212; the usual suspects.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at some of the other major deciding factors influencing shoppers:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-16.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21240" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-16.png" alt="" width="636" height="527" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-16.png 636w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-16-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Influencing Factors for Purchasing Online </em></p>
<p class="p1">If your customer research revealed that your customers were worried about returning items, your hook could be “Free Returns for 90 days.” I’ve covered<a href="https://www.scubemarketing.com/blog/e-commerce-ppc-business"> Free-Return Policy impacts ecommerce PPC campaigns</a> in a separate article.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Lever #4. Retargeting Channels</h3>
<p class="p1">Once you have Buyer Segments, Recency Segments, and Hooks ironed out, it’s time to implement your knowledge.</p>
<p class="p1">At this point, you should have a nice document with a framework that can be implemented on any retargeting platform, be it Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, AdRoll, or a combination of platforms.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>To implement your framework, first map the Buyer and Recency Segments and their respective hooks across the retargeting channels.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Your message will be consistent across the board. When making a decision, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which platforms will reach the most users in your target audience?</li>
<li>Which platforms are the best fit given the size of your site?</li>
<li>Which platforms will reach a unique audience, and which will cannibalize your existing efforts?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The example below uses two retargeting platforms: Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-17.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21239" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-17.png" alt="" width="640" height="169" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-17.png 1093w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-17-300x79.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-17-750x198.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Retargeting Matrix Example </em></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Second &#8211; develop audiences in the respective retargeting platforms.</strong> This includes both audiences &#8212; who you want to target, and who you want to exclude. The Retargeting Marketing Framework allows you to visualize the audience structure.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Third &#8211; develop campaign and ad group structure based on the matrix.</strong> Use Buyer Segments as Campaigns, and Recency Segments as Ad Groups/Ad Sets. This structure helps with evaluating performance, which allows you to make tweaks where necessary.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Fourth &#8211; develop your ad copy and creative.</strong> Use the Retargeting Marketing Framework as a spec sheet for your creative team. You have the audiences, objectives, and hooks.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Fifth &#8211; hit launch, and monitor.</strong></p>
<h3 class="p7">Final Thoughts on Retargeting</h3>
<p class="p1">Let’s stop for a moment and let everything sink in.</p>
<p class="p1">Retargeting can be managed effectively. Remember, it&#8217;s about going back to basics and knowing how your buyers use your website, what their pain points are, and then executing on a campaign that helps them make an informed decision.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you get the basics down, you can start with the really fun stuff like mobile retargeting — but one thing at a time.</p>
<p class="p1">You have all the tools you need. You have a framework you can use to plan, develop, and scale retargeting campaigns — the way professionals do.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get people to visit your store.</li>
<li>Do everything in your power to turn those visitors into customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>The former usually requires a fair chunk of time and money, which puts even more emphasis and importance on the latter.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to just have quality products and a good-looking storefront: you need to engage your visitors and stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways online stores engage customers is with popups and banners. These on-screen interactions aren’t so different from a sale sign in the front window of a brick-and-mortar store, or a sales clerk asking if you’d like to join their loyalty program.</p>
<p>Popups aren’t a recent invention, of course.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/">The first popup ad</a> flashed onto the scene in the mid-’90s, and since then online marketers have weighed the downsides of using popups — annoying customers, interrupting user experience, even slowing down page speeds — with the fact that <strong>popups are really, really effective</strong>.</p>
<p>How effective?</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>One study found that switching from a sidebar form to a lightbox-style popup design increased email signups by 1,375%.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>One study found that switching from a sidebar form to a lightbox-style popup <a href="https://blog.aweber.com/email-marketing/easy-secret-more-subscribers.htm">increased email signups by 1,375%</a>. Another business tried using a popup to capture email signups and saw a <a href="https://thrivethemes.com/10x-increase-case-study/">10x increase in subscription rate</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a fan or not, using popups is a surefire way of attracting visitors’ attention, whether it’s to collect an email address, promote a sale, or something else. Even the ugliest popups generally convert well — which is why nearly every website uses them.</p>
<p>While popups aren’t a new phenomenon, what is relatively recent is the development and proliferation of more elegant, more manageable popup solutions.</p>
<p>In 2017, not only do users expect to see popups when they visit websites, but marketers, including online store owners, have tools for creating popups that look great and serve their customers’ interests.</p>
<p>That last point is key to using popups well, and it’s something we’ll expand on later in this post when we share some best practices for using popups in your store.</p>
<p>For now, just remember that <strong>popups should always offer the customer a benefit</strong>. As an online store owner, if you don’t have a mutually beneficial reason for showing a popup, then it’s probably not worth it.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>If you don’t have a mutually beneficial reason for showing a popup to a customer, then it’s not worth it.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>When we designed <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/pixelpop-popups-banners-with-exit-intent/">Pixelpop</a>, our goal was to give online businesses a way of doubling down on the world-class customer experience we had in mind when we designed <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">all 67 Stencil themes currently in the BigCommerce theme store</a>. We wanted to help merchants get the most out of every person who visits their store, whether that means converting them into sales now or collecting their email to increase the chance of converting them in the future.</p>
<p>In the end, we built a popup app that’s incredibly easy to use, and that makes it easy for any store owner to create an assortment of <a href="https://blog.justuno.com/10-inspiring-examples-of-email-pop-up-designs-and-why-they-work">great-looking popup designs</a> and banners designed to engage visitors, boost conversions, and drive sales.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we’ve thought a lot about what it means to create a winning engagement strategy, from the popup types and options you should consider, to exactly how to match your popup to your brand and BigCommerce theme.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll share what we’ve learned and give you the tools necessary to make sure you’re engaging every visitor in the best way possible.</p>

<p></div>
<h2>Rule #1. Start collecting email addresses</h2>
<p>If you’re already doing this, kudos! You’re off to a great start.</p>
<p>If not, now is the time to add Pixelpop to your store (it takes two seconds) and create an email signup popup. Go on, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/pixelpop-popups-banners-with-exit-intent/">add the app right now</a>. We’ll be here when you come back.</p>
<p>Here’s what it should look like right before you launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-01.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21156" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-01.png" alt="pop up window" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-01.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-01-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-01-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>So why is collecting email addresses so important? For one thing, no matter how great your products are, no matter what special deals you’re offering, you’re never going to convert every shopper who visits your store.</p>
<p>The vast majority are going to poke around for a bit, see what you have to offer, and then bounce off in search of the next great deal.</p>
<p>By using an email signup popup, you give yourself a chance at re-engaging those visitors and selling to them in the future — not just once, but over and over again.</p>
<p>And if you’re one of those people who believe email marketing is dead? Consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thedma.org/blog/data-driven-marketing/saturday-stat-series/">66% of online customers</a> have completed a purchase as a result of a marketing email</li>
<li>Email prompts purchases at <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/emarketer-review-key-2013-trends-coverage-areas-platform-growth/">3 times the rate</a> of social media</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/data/public/reports/benchmark-reports/EXCERPT-BMR-2013-Email-Marketing.pdf">72% of people</a> prefer to receive promotional content through email (compared to 17% who prefer social media)</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is, if you’re not using a popup to collect email addresses, you’re missing out on a big opportunity and an even bigger chunk of sales.</p>
<p>In 10 minutes, you can create an email signup popup and sync it to MailChimp or Conversio so that signups are automatically added to your mailing list of choice. If you use a different email service provider, you can also download a CSV file with collected email addresses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-02.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21157" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-02.png" alt="ecommerce pop up design" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-02.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-02-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-02-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Easily style your pop-up to fit your brand and needs. </em></p>
<p>When the busy shopping periods hit and it becomes even more expensive to acquire traffic, you’ll be glad to have a list of customers who are familiar with your brand and products, who you can target with specialized sales and offers.</p>
<h2>Rule #2. Run popups with planned campaigns</h2>
<p>Pixelpop supports more than just email signups. In fact, it offers 7 popup types in total:</p>
<ol>
<li>Email Signup</li>
<li>Announcement</li>
<li>Page Promotion</li>
<li>Coupon Code</li>
<li>Social Follow</li>
<li>Custom Image</li>
<li>Cookie Disclaimer</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, you’re obviously not going to run all of these things at once, but you can pick and choose what and when to promote, and how to work popups into your various campaigns.</p>
<h3>Free Shipping Banners &amp; Popups</h3>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">if you offer free shipping</a>, it’s always a good idea to announce that loud and proud at the top or bottom of the page. BigCommerce themes offer a built-in banner area that works well for this, but its customization is rather limited compared to the diversity of options supported by Pixelpop.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-03.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21158" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-03.png" alt="how to create popups" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-03.png 2516w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-03-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-03-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can see the <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Creating-Editing-Banners">built-in BigCommerce banner</a> at the bottom of the above screenshot.</em></p>
<p>To create a shipping banner that really grabs customers’ attention, you’ll need a solution from the app store. There are standalone apps dedicated to this functionality, but with Pixelpop all you need to do is create an announcement popup and select “bar” when picking your shape.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-04.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21159" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-04.png" alt="create a pop up with Pixelpop" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-04.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-04-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-04-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Pixelpop version of a banner on a BigCommerce store. These can replace the out-of-the-box banners. </em></p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Can you afford to offer free shipping?</h3></p>
<p>If you don’t offer free shipping, you should take a moment to consider if it could be a good option for your store. Start by <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.ca/ecommerce-answers/what-average-order-value/">calculating your average order value</a> for the past few months, increase that by 10-20%, and try offering free shipping on any order over that amount.</p>
<p></div>
<h3>Sales &amp; Promotion Banners &amp; Popups</h3>
<p>Similar to free shipping, if you’re running a holiday sale or any other promotion, you’ll want to make sure visitors know about it the moment they land on your page.</p>
<p>Using a page promotion popup, you can direct traffic to a featured or discounted product page, or even a special piece of content like a sales page or gift guide.</p>
<p>Here’s an example view while the pop-up is in build mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-05.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21160" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-05.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-05.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-05-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-05-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3>Coupon Code Banners &amp; Popups</h3>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>96% of U.S. shoppers say they look for and use coupons.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>The coupon code popup is also ideal for promotions, as it displays a coupon code that visitors can use to get a discount at checkout. (And if you don’t believe in coupons, consider the <a href="http://retailmenot.mediaroom.com/2014-09-08-We-Are-a-Coupon-Nation">96% of U.S. shoppers</a> who report using coupons!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-06.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21161" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-06.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-06.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-06-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-06-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You can create pop-ups that take up the entire screen, but still mesh with your brand. </em></p>
<p>Versatility was key when we were designing Pixelpop. We wanted to give merchants an all-in-one tool they could use in conjunction with every campaign, whether that meant building their mailing list, getting more social followers, or clearing out inventory with a weekend sale.</p>
<p>If you’re doing something special for your store, don’t just sit back and expect customers to find out about it. Create a popup and deliver your message loud and clear.</p>
<h2>Rule #3. Time your popups effectively</h2>
<p>Before publishing a popup, review the settings available and make sure each popup is appearing in the right place, at the right time. Pixelpop offers a range of scheduling and delay options, which you can use to refine your engagement strategy.</p>
<p>Here is what that interface looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-07.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21162" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-07.png" alt="" width="640" height="294" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-07.png 1348w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-07-300x138.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-07-750x345.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-08.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21163" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-08.png" alt="" width="640" height="425" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-08.png 1572w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-08-300x199.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-08-750x499.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Scheduling is simple enough — choose a start and end date for your popup window to appear — but there’s plenty of room for finesse when it comes to delays.</p>
<p>With Pixelpop, you have your choice of several types of delays, including page delays (number of pages viewed), scroll delays (percentage of page scrolled), timed delays (amount of time spent on page), and every online marketer’s favorite: exit-intent delays (we’ll explain those in a sec).</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>Using a slight delay gives potential customers a chance to see what your store is offering before you try to sign them up for anything.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>In the case of sales and special offers, you generally want to show those popups as soon as possible, which means not using any delays. However, with other popups, such as email signups and coupon code offers, it can be better to hold off for a little bit.</p>
<p>Using a page delay of 2-5 pages, using a scroll delay of 60-70%, or using a timed delay of 10-20 seconds is a good way of letting your visitors look around before asking for their email address. Using a slight delay gives potential customers a chance to see what your store is offering before you try to sign them up for anything.</p>
<h3>Exit-Intent Popups</h3>
<p>Delaying a coupon code popup is a similar way of building incentive, and it’s also a perfect use case for the much-ballyhooed exit-intent popup. If you haven’t heard of these little beauties, basically what they do is wait until the last possible moment before the visitor is about to leave your store, and then pop onto the scene in all their conversion-driving glory.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-09.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21164" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-09.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-09.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-09-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-09-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The reason exit-intent works so well with coupon code popups (and email signups, for that matter) is because you give the visitor the maximum amount of time to get interested in your products without interrupting their experience, and then, right when they’re about to leave, you get a perfect opportunity to convert them.</p>
<p>In a brick-and-mortar world, that would be like having a clairvoyant sales associate who knows exactly how long to leave the customer on their own before engaging them with an offer.</p>
<p>So how effective are exit-intent delays?</p>
<p>Consider that the current global cart abandonment rate hovers <a href="https://www.listrak.com/digital-marketing-automation/multichannel-marketing-solutions/email-marketing/shopping-cart-abandonment-index.aspx">somewhere around 77%</a>. Studies have shown that exit-intent offers can recover a significant chunk of lost sales by convincing shoppers to stick around or come back later with a special coupon code or email marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Try creating a coupon code popup in the shape of a “full-screen takeover,” enable exit-intent to offer customers a 10% discount, and see what kind of conversion lift you get.</p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How Much More Can You Make?</h3></p>
<p>Use this free <a href="http://tools.bigcommerce.com/abandoned-cart-calculator/">Abandoned Cart Calculator</a> to see how much more money you could be making if you could email customers to drive them back to purchase.</p>
<p></div>
<h2>Rule #4. Use advanced targeting for even better results</h2>
<p>Speaking of refining your engagement strategy, you can tailor popups for certain audience segments. If you want to only show it to people from a certain country, or only on certain pages, or only to people arriving from a certain email campaign — more power to you.</p>
<p>There’s lots you can do with Pixelpop’s targeting options. If you want to customize your messaging or offers for different global audiences, or run regional sales based around national holidays (Cinco de Mayo sale, anyone?), you can enable geo-targeting with the “Target by location” option.</p>
<p>Here is what that interface looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-10.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21165" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-10.png" alt="" width="640" height="372" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-10.png 1373w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-10-300x174.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-10-750x435.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>If you want to draw attention to a sale on a individual product, you can create a special popup that appears only on that product page using the “Target By Page” option.</p>
<p>Again, here is what that interface looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-11.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21166" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-11.png" alt="" width="640" height="420" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-11.png 1375w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-11-300x197.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-11-750x492.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>One highly effective way you can use advanced targeting is with the <em>“Target By URL/UTM Parameter”</em> option. What this means is the popup will only show to customers arriving at your site from a specified URL (or partial URL).</p>
<p>If your customer is arriving from an email or ad campaign, you can use a banner or popup to welcome them to your site and reiterate an offer or promote a product they’ve seen before. This creates a more cohesive link between your emails, ads, promotions, etc. and your online store – and often increases conversions.</p>
<p>And again, what the interface looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-12.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21167" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-12.png" alt="" width="640" height="412" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-12.png 1373w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-12-300x193.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-12-750x482.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Next time you send an email to your mailing list, create an accompanying popup with a coupon for 10% off as a thanks for being a loyal subscriber, and add a UTM parameter which you can then paste into your targeting options.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you’re running an ad with a specific product featured in it, create a popup on your store advertising a discount on that product, and then attach a UTM parameter to both your ad and your popup’s targeting options.</p>
<h2>Rule #5. Match your popups to your theme</h2>
<p>One of the best things about Pixelpop is its rich, easy-to-use popup editor that lets you pick from a range of popup themes and custom fonts, colors, shapes, sizes, and styles. A live preview lets you see how your popup looks in your store as you edit it, including the option to preview what it looks like on mobile devices and tablets.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-13.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21168 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-13.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-13.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-13-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-13-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Easily customize your pop-up to match your site’s theme and branding across all devices.</em></p>
<p>If you’re a Stencil user, all the better, because now is a good time to remind you that Pixel Union, the ecommerce design agency behind Pixelpop, is the same team that designed <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">all 67 themes currently available in the BigCommerce Theme Store</a>.</p>
<p>What that means is you’re working with the very same design ethos that went into creating your BigCommerce storefront. Not only that, but you have access to Pixel Union’s customer support team, the same nice folks you would contact if you ever needed help with your theme.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re a Blueprint user, don’t despair:</strong> Pixelpop is fully compatible with all Blueprint themes, and its versatility makes it easy to boost engagement with a popup that matches your store.</p>
<h3>Which Popup Styles to Use with Your Stencil Theme</h3>
<p>On that note, picking the right popup design for your store is important. Take an image-heavy theme like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/geneva-bold/">Geneva</a> or <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/lookbook-standard/">Lookbook</a>, for example. To complement its full-width design, you’ll want a clean, crisp popup that doesn’t detract from your beautiful product photography. A solid black or white background, depending on the tone of your images, is always a good call.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-14.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21169" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-14.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-14.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-14-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-14-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>On the the other hand, if you use a more classic, grid-based theme like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/foundry-classic/">Foundry</a> or <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/venture-bright/">Venture</a>, you can be a bit more daring in your popup design. You still want it to complement the page’s fonts and colors, but don’t be afraid to design a popup that grabs the customer’s attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-15.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21170" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-15.png" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-15.png 2560w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-15-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ecommerce-pop-ups-15-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Also think about where on the page your popups appear and how that will affect your theme. If you use a theme like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/merchant-classic/">Merchant</a>, which has a modal-shaped feature area and CTA button designed right into the carousel, avoid modal-shaped homepage popups and stick to bars, cards, and full-screen takeovers.</p>

<p>Conversely, a dual-column theme like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/capacity-bright/">Capacity</a> is perfect for a nicely designed modal.</p>

<p>Pixelpop’s full-screen editor features a color picker with hex code support so you can easily implement your brand’s color scheme. Every popup theme also comes with an assortment of hand-picked font options, so you can find one that complements your theme.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you’ll dramatically improve your customers’ experience and build trust by making sure your popups look professional and match the look and feel of your store.</p>
<h2>Rule #6. Follow best practices for creating popups</h2>
<p>Before we sign off with our final call to go try our popup maker, Pixelpop, (that one doesn’t count), we thought we’d lay down a few final ground rules or best practices for using popups.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep your messaging clear and succinct.</strong> We could easily have included this as part of the last rule, as succinct copy has a lot to do with good design. Do everything you can to avoid having your copy go on for more than a couple of lines. More importantly, make sure your messaging is clear, engaging, and consistent with your brand’s voice. Don’t be afraid to be funny!</li>
<li><strong>Don’t clutter the page with popups.</strong> How would you like to visit an online store and find popup ads popping up all over the place? Well, neither would your customers. As a rule, stick to a maximum of two popups on any given page, and never use the same shape twice on a single page. Bar-shaped popups are the easiest to pair with additional popups.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate with a mailing service like MailChimp or Conversio.</strong> Who wants to deal with CSV files and manual imports and exports? Not us. Connect your Email Signup popup to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/mailchimp/">MailChimp</a> or <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/conversio/">Conversio</a> to have all new signups be automatically synced to your mailing list of choice.</li>
<li><strong>Test it, including on mobile.</strong> Whatever popup solution you’re using, don’t make the mistake of publishing a popup without testing it first. That means double-checking links and checking to see how it looks on mobile. Pixelpop’s live preview lets you see right in the editor how it will appear on tablet and mobile phones, which can save you a ton of time.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure it meets Google’s mobile-friendliness guidelines.</strong> On that note, if you didn’t hear, <a href="https://www.pixelunion.net/blog/google-mobile-popup-crackdown-online-store/">Google rolled out some changes to its algorithm</a> earlier this year with the goal of making the web more friendly to mobile users. Pixelpop’s “Google Mobile-Friendly” setting makes sure your popups comply with these new guidelines, automatically condensing your popups into bars when loaded on mobile devices, so you don’t need to worry about taking an SEO hit.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure it offers a benefit to the customer.</strong> We mentioned this near the start of the post, and truth be told, it’s the one piece of advice we want every merchant to keep in mind when creating popups for their store. If you’re going to disrupt a visitor’s browsing experience, you should make sure you’re doing it in a way that will make them say “Thanks!” and not “Go away!”</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, there are lots of ways you can engage visitors in a mutually beneficial way — offering a discount or special promotion, telling them about a product they might find interesting, linking to a piece of content you’ve written to help them find what they’re looking for, and so on.</p>
<p>At their core, popups are a way of bringing you closer to your customers — giving you what you both want, and making everyone happy.</p>

Nor are we going to bother with a discussion of fundamental image edits because we’ve already covered that in the others chapters in this guide and we’ll assume you are following general best practices.</p>
<p class="p1">If not, you can get caught up in the subsequent chapters where we cover:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">How to build your own product photo studio (including the equipment you will need)</li>
<li class="p1">How to use your smartphone for product photos, if that’s all you have</li>
<li class="p1">How to shape light</li>
<li class="p1">How to add shadows</li>
<li class="p1">How to photograph highly reflective products</li>
<li class="p1">How to remove white backgrounds</li>
<li class="p1">How to master ghost mannequin photography</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">If you come across a term you don’t recognize, refer to our <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/glossary-retouching-product-images/">retouching glossary</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, this chapter focuses on more advanced techniques, broadly categorized as retouching. We’ll walk you through popular retouching choices for three common ways to shoot apparel:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">flat</li>
<li class="p1">on a mannequin or hanger</li>
<li class="p1">on model</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Let’s focus specifically on garment retouching (divided into light, medium, and heavy levels), before finishing with a discussion of <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/skin-retouching-dos-and-donts/">model skin retouching</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Note: This isn’t a how-to; it’s an exploration of what retouching is and what it can do for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">We’ll discuss best practices, but just as in photography, many retouching decisions are driven by your brand’s aesthetic.</p>
<p class="p1">Outdoor apparel may call for a raw natural look, while luxury brands favor a more glamorous appearance.</p>
<p class="p1">We won’t try to make those decisions for you; we’ll simply present you with options and explain why each route might be favored.</p>
<p class="p1">At <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/">Pixelz</a> we’ve edited over 15 million images for leading brands, retailers, and commercial photo studios. The principles we’re discussing here are based on our experience, but should not be taken to represent any of our clients. All opinions expressed are our own.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Garment Retouching</h2>
<p class="p1">The principles of garment retouching are largely the same regardless of whether you’re shooting flat, on a hanger or mannequin, or on-model. Your biggest concerns are cleanup and shape.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21011" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/garment-retouching.png" alt="" width="617" height="412" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/garment-retouching.png 617w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/garment-retouching-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>No matter how much time a stylist takes on prep, samples aren’t going to be perfect.</em></p>
<p class="p1">When you’re shooting samples, well, your photos aren’t going to be perfect right out of the camera.</p>
<p class="p1">Your stylist may be able to fix some problems through <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/prepare-your-products-for-a-photoshoot-like-a-pro/">product photoshoot preparation</a>, pinning, and clever arrangements, but what do you do when the fabric is too sheer, the color is off, or one leg is longer than the other?</p>
<p class="p1">Retouching can solve problems that can’t be handled in the studio (as well as simplifying many that can).</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s take a look at some common retouching processes, broken down by level. We’ll also talk about two techniques that fall outside of basic level categorization:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">symmetry</li>
<li class="p1">ghost mannequins</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p6">Light Retouching: The Fix It Up Process</h3>
<p class="p1">Light retouching focuses on cleanup, which means removal and replacement of obviously unwanted details. In this scenario, there are few aesthetic decisions to be made and you’re essentially performing repairs.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21008" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-before.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="398" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-before.jpg 2685w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-before-300x373.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-before-750x933.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-21007" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-after.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="398" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-after.jpg 2685w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-after-300x373.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-after-750x933.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Before and after of jean legs retouched to erase creases caused by styling to strike mannequin ankle.</em></p>
<p class="p1">You should almost always remove evidence of styling, wear, and construction problems. That means removing dust, pins, untidy stitching, and loose threads. It also means removing heavy creases like <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/glossary-retouching-product-images/#B19">packaging creases</a>, or <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/glossary-retouching-product-images/#B20">creases from styling</a> (like if a trouser leg has been shortened by a stylist with a mid-leg fold).</p>
<p class="p1">Light retouching also involves recreating areas after removing small props, like hangers, wire hands, or mannequin cutaway necks.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>When to use light retouching</h3></p>
<p class="p1">If you have a modest budget, you should be performing this level of retouching. Showing someone a worn down sample with pins sticking out of the shoulders isn’t accurately representing your product.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p6">Medium Retouching: The Low Hanging Fruit Process</h3>
<p class="p1">Medium level retouching also focuses on cleanup, but starts to move into shape smoothing as well.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re doing everything you did at the light level, while also making more subjective/aesthetic decisions to proactively improve your image.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21006" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-before.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="482" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-before.jpg 3633w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-before-300x452.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-before-750x1130.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-21005" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-after.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="480" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-after.jpg 3648w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-after-300x450.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-after-750x1125.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Before and after of retouching to remove crease caused by misfit; note armpit and shoulder area.</em></p>
<p class="p1">For example, you’re still removing packaging creases, but now you’re also removing creases and folds caused by misfit or styling challenges. Like, if a product fits a mannequin too tightly and creases are uneven on opposing sides of the body, you can reduce creases through retouching.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re also focusing on outer shape.</p>
<p class="p1">Shape is one of the most important parts of apparel product images, because it’s a demonstration of fit. Using retouching to smooth the edges of a garment, eliminating small bumps from an imperfect fit, is an excellent way to improve the presentation of your product.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>When to use medium retouching</h3></p>
<p class="p1">We recommend this level of retouching in most instances. You get all the cleanup of light retouching along with improvements that are relevant to almost all product images. If you have special challenges that aren’t addressed at this level, you can up the ante to heavy retouching.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p6">Heavy Retouching: The Image Detailing Process</h3>
<p class="p1">Heavy retouching focuses in on details like shadowing, imprints, and consistency.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, you’re doing everything you did at the medium level while adding additional retouching.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20999" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-before.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="480" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-before.jpg 1393w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-before-300x450.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-before-750x1125.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-20998" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-after.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="480" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-after.jpg 1393w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-after-300x450.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-after-750x1125.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Using silhouettes for retouching can create extremely consistent shape.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Note that a heavily retouched image still isn’t one you look at and say, “Wow, that looks plastic!” That’s not heavy retouching, that’s bad retouching.</p>
<p class="p1">At no point should anyone ever look at one of your product images and think it’s fake. That immediately kills your credibility with the viewer, and with no trust there’s no sale.</p>
<p class="p1">To explain heavy retouching, let’s think about it in terms of creases, always one of the biggest issues addressed by retouching.</p>
<p class="p1">At the heavy retouch level, you’re not just removing obvious creases; you’re also reducing hard shadows, contrast, and highlights caused by creases. It’s a more subtle approach that can improve images with difficult fabrics, like laminated jackets.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes undesirable imprints can appear and create confusion about what’s part of a garment and what’s caused by outside factors. For example, sheer fabric can show visible outlines of mannequins, undergarments, nipples, and pockets. Retouching can eliminate those distractions.</p>
<p class="p1">Retouching can also ensure consistent shape is given to edge lines like sleeve cuffs, trouser cuffs, waistbands, and hemlines.</p>
<p class="p1">By consistent shape, I mean something like always curving in, curving out, or staying straight.</p>
<p class="p1">Consistency is pleasing to the eye and shows an attention to detail that builds credibility with customers.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Symmetry</h3>
<p class="p1">Many human standards of beauty are based on symmetry; for example, numerous studies have proven that more symmetrical faces are considered more beautiful.</p>
<p class="p1">Why does that matter? Because it alludes to a psychological preference for symmetry by your customers (and likely, even, by you!).</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21010" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-before.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-before.jpg 3500w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-before-300x469.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-before-750x1173.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-21009" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-after.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-after.jpg 3499w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-after-300x469.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-after-750x1173.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Before and after of retouching to ensure a symmetrical shape in product images.</em></p>
<p class="p1">When symmetrical apparel, like most jackets, dresses, tops, and pants, is photographed asymmetrically it looks sloppy.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes it creates a pronounced lean, or makes the quality of construction look poor. This is especially evident in product images shot on mannequin or on hangers, where there’s no implied human movement to make irregularities seem natural.</p>
<p class="p1">Symmetry can be applied in retouching by setting guidelines and applying them across your product category.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, for outerwear like a jacket we will:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Set a vertical axis</li>
<li class="p1">Match the height of major points like shoulders, armpits, sleeves, hems</li>
<li class="p1">Match the width of sleeves</li>
<li class="p1">Match the gap between sleeves and torso</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Ensuring symmetry through retouching is one of the most beneficial things you can do to create a consistent, attractive presentation, and we recommend it regardless of the level of retouching.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Invisible / Ghost Mannequin</h3>
<p class="p1">We’ve covered the invisible mannequin effect, aka the ghost mannequin, previously, but it is worth mentioning again.</p>
<p class="p1">In brief, the invisible mannequin is a post-production technique that combines two or more photos to create a single mannequin-free image. It has the advantage of demonstrating on-figure shape and showing more of the product than otherwise possible while minimizing distractions.</p>
<p class="p1">The invisible mannequin is a good option for retailers who need on-figure imagery but don’t want mannequins in their images or to use a increase budget on models.</p>
<p class="p1">Speaking of models&#8230;</p>
<h2 class="p3">Model Skin Retouching &amp; Cropping</h2>
<p class="p1">I’ve found that if you start a conversation about retouching (“You know, Photoshop”) with someone outside of the photography industry, 9 times out of 10 they jump straight to body image, advertising, and the harmful effects of unrealistic expectations for women.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re not discussing body shape here.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a valid discussion, and <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/photoshop-models-laws/">one we’ve covered in depth in elsewhere</a>, but this article is about skin retouching.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re not touching body fat or bone structure.</p>
<p class="p1">Before we dive into different aesthetics surrounding moles, skin tone, and eye bags, let’s briefly talk about a sometimes overlooked aspect of handling model images: cropping.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Cropping: Face or Faceless?</h3>
<p class="p1">If you have model product images that are tops or full body, you may want to consider eliminating some headaches by the simple expedient of cropping them out.</p>
<p class="p1">A traditional crop for model images is at the top of the head. After all, a beautiful face helps sell product.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21012" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/face-or-faceless.png" alt="" width="550" height="417" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/face-or-faceless.png 550w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/face-or-faceless-300x227.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Cropping part of a model’s face affects usage rights, casting, product focus, and retouching.</em></p>
<p class="p1">However, cropping consistently at a different axis, like below the eyes, below the nose, or below the mouth has its own advantages.</p>
<h3 class="p1">1.Usage rights</h3>
<p class="p1">Many models and agencies are open to granting rights to faceless images for longer terms than images featuring the face.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s pretty simple: an image where the model can’t be identified isn’t as valuable as an image where they can.</p>
<p class="p1">Please note that image usage rights can be complex. If it’s not directly addressed in your model release, don’t just assume you can crop out the model’s face and use it forever.</p>
<h3 class="p1">2. Model casting</h3>
<p class="p1">You can cast a wider net when casting models if you’re focused on fit and don’t have to be as concerned about face. That can mean finding a better body fit and lower rates.</p>
<h3 class="p1">3. Product focus</h3>
<p class="p1">Eyes draw the eye. If a model’s face is on the page, people will inevitably be drawn to that face. If they’re looking at the face, they’re not looking at your product. Crop below the eyes and you will retain a greater product focus.</p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Retouching simplification</h3>
<p class="p1">Because the face is uncovered and naturally attracts close scrutiny, a disproportionate amount of retouching time is spent on it compared to other parts of the model. If you crop out most of the face, you don’t have to deal with flyaway hairs, eye bags, or as much acne, freckles, and general skin blemishes.</p>
<p class="p1">Regardless of where you choose to crop your model product images, you should be consistent. You will also have to decide what style of retouching you want to use for the rest of the model’s skin.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Skin Retouching: Know Thyself</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21002" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-recline.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-recline.jpg 1200w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-recline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-recline-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Skin retouching is about understanding your brand’s aesthetic and staying true to it. It’s less about “how much” you want to retouch, and more about making sure the retouching you perform reinforces your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">For comparison, let’s look at two different styles of skin retouching:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Natural</li>
<li class="p1">Classic</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">They require a similar level of effort and hence will cost you about the same should you hire a professional retoucher or service.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Natural Skin Retouching &#8211; Here Today or Here Forever?</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21004" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-before.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="844" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-before.jpg 2211w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-before-300x396.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-before-750x989.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Natural retouching leaves most moles and freckles because they’re a permanent feature of a model’s skin.</em></p>
<p class="p1">If you’re an outdoor apparel brand that prides itself on looking great while getting down and dirty, you don’t want your model’s face to look like it’s in a cosmetics’ ad.</p>
<p class="p1">The guiding principle for natural retouching is that less is more.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re retouching to remove distractions, but if you go too far, you will actually create a distraction by becoming obviously inauthentic. Natural retouching should be subtle.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Do’s and Dont’s</h3></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">The two major parts of skin retouching address:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Skin tone and texture</li>
<li class="p1">Marks and blemishes</li>
</ol>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21001" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-before.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="884" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-before.jpg 1645w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-before-300x828.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-before-750x2071.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-21000" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-after.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="884" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-after.jpg 1645w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-after-300x828.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-after-750x2071.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Note model’s thighs. Tone of the face has been taken and the rest of skin retouched to match.</em></p>
<p class="p1">An effective approach to skin tone is to simply even it out over the entire body. Nobody tans evenly, and when a model is standing all day under bright lights, circulation will become poor and extremities redden (particularly hands).</p>
<p class="p1">Picking a neutral area, like the face, and then adjusting tone elsewhere to match that reference will create a more attractive photo.</p>
<p class="p1">When I say “blemishes,” I mean acne, moles, bruises, scratches, birthmarks, freckles, and other marks on the skin. Natural retouching focuses on reduction rather than removal, usually following a temporary vs permanent rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Is it here today, or here forever?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Answering that question tells you what to do with a blemish, if you’re following natural retouching principles.</p>
<p class="p1">Acne and bruises are temporary. If you’re removing them, you’re not fundamentally changing your model’s skin. They usually don’t have those marks.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, a scar or birthmark is a permanent part of the model. Leaving blemishes like that, unless they’re so prominent as to be distracting, stays true to your model’s character.</p>
<p class="p1">Run that rule over your model’s skin and what seemed vague and subjective becomes a much simpler standard.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Goosebumps? Temporary, gone.</li>
<li class="p1">Freckles? Permanent, keep them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">Classic Skin Retouching &#8211; Remove Blemishes, Soften and Smooth Skin</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21003" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-after.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="844" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-after.jpg 2211w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-after-300x396.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-after-750x989.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Classic retouching removes most moles, freckles, and other blemishes.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Have you ever watched a movie on a brand new HDTV and had that “too real” feeling? Where the picture is so sharp and smooth that it actually looks worse, like the latest Hollywood special effects blockbuster is a soap opera?</p>
<p class="p1">Classic retouching can help you avoid a similar feeling in your product photography.</p>
<p class="p1">Incredibly high definition cameras and powerful lights can create a photo that counters an audience’s expectation of what a product image should be.</p>
<p class="p1">Classic retouching doesn’t usually bother with evening out skin tone unless there are notable differences. Rather, all skin is softened and smoothed to create the aspirationally perfect skin expected of a cover model.</p>
<p class="p1">Most blemishes are removed in classic retouching, like freckles and prominent moles, but not all of them. It’s good to leave less noticeable moles or the occasional freckle to keep a feeling of familiarity.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, you never want to go so far that an image feels fake.</p>
<h2 class="p3">How To Get Your Images Retouched</h2>
<p class="p1">Now that you understand what retouching can do, the next question is how to get your images retouched cost-effectively.</p>
<p class="p1">There are basically two options:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">in-house</li>
<li class="p1">outsourced</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">In-house means doing it yourself, hiring full-time retouchers, or hiring freelancers. All three options are time consuming, expensive, and don’t scale well (seasonal shoots cause frequent bottlenecks). They do, however, usually give you tight control and good communication.</p>
<p class="p1">Traditional outsourcing offers lower prices and more scale, but at the risk of inconsistent quality and poor communication. If you end up with the wrong outsourcing solution, it will drain you of time and resources without actually improving your quality.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Outsourced Options</h3>
<p class="p1">Pixelz is a professional retouching solution that gives you the control and communication of in-house editing through a fully developed web platform and professional support.</p>
<p class="p1">A plan like Pixelz PRO Retailer offers product-specific retouching options, next-morning turnaround times, and prices starting at less than a dollar per image. You can try Pixelz out with <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/">10 free retouched images of your choice</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li class="p1">It drives direct traffic.</li>
<li class="p1">It speaks to both existing customers and prospects.</li>
<li class="p1">It engages.</li>
<li class="p1">It builds brand loyalty.</li>
<li class="p1">It increases AOV.</li>
<li class="p1">It builds brand assets and, ultimately, grows your bottom line.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The only reason anyone says email marketing is dead is because they aren’t very good at it. And when you aren’t very good at it, you won’t get any of the benefits.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s just look at the numbers really quickly.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization/">A good ecommerce conversion rate</a> will hover at about 3-5%. That means, then, on average, 95-97% of the people who come to your website will leave without ever buying a thing.</p>
<p class="p1">Capturing the email addresses of those 95-97% of people and building engagement through email is your most cost effective route to turning these browsers into buyers (and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies/">retaining existing customers</a>).</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">In my 6 years at <a href="https://sumo.com/sites">Sumo.com</a>, I’ve sent more than one hundred million emails – and I’ve learned a thing or two about what works, and what is just industry hype.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">You can retarget ads at them, but you’re bidding on those placements and you’re restricted in what you can say. With email, you own the channel. You can say exactly what you want, as often as you want and for relatively little cost.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, just because you can say what you want as often as you want doesn’t mean you should.</p>
<p class="p1">In my 6 years at <a href="https://sumo.com/sites">Sumo.com</a> (and <a href="http://www.appsumo.com/">AppSumo</a>!), I’ve sent more than one hundred million emails –– and I’ve learned a thing or two about what works, what is just industry hype and how to get customers to actually talk to you, and like it, too!</p>

<h2 class="p3">How to Increase Ecommerce Email Engagement</h2>
<h3 class="p4">The Spousal Technique</h3>
<p class="p1">You want to build a relationship with someone through email. Let’s start with the basics, then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">How do you build a high engaged and valuable relationship?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">I call this the spousal technique. Now, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re married or not, but if you have a husband or wife, then you generally have 100% open rate when you send them an email. How can you get your customers to do the same?</p>
<p class="p1">You build a relationship and you treat them the way you would someone you care about. That means, you are invested in building a relationship.</p>
<p class="p1">In terms of good subject lines and bad, the ones that I&#8217;ve seen that have worked for me are one’s I’d send to a friend:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Can I call you?</li>
<li class="p1">How was your year?</li>
<li class="p1">What&#8217;d you have for dinner?</li>
<li class="p1">Have you seen this?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I don&#8217;t like lying ones. Those piss me off and I generally stop trusting the brand. I don&#8217;t remember what brand did this but they did RE: for like reply in the subject line like I emailed them, so it was a fake reply and it just looked like a lie to me. I really didn&#8217;t appreciate that and now I unsubscribed.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about that. You also have to be considerate about what you are saying in your entire email, how you phrase it, why you are saying it and what your desired outcome is. You have to think through it the same way you would with your spouse or a good friend. Invest in building that relationship.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is how I do it.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The Spousal Technique in Practice</h3>
<p class="p1">The easiest thing that most people forget is just to keep it really simple with your customers. What I do personally on my own site –– <a href="http://okdork.com/">okdork.com</a> –– is once someone subscribes, I send them an email asking them what the one thing is I could to make their day better.</p>
<p class="p1">I literally get 50 responses a day from that email with specific requests about what I could do. That&#8217;s cool! People are engaging. They are responding. I’m getting to know my audience.</p>
<p class="p1">I recommend other brands doing this as well. When someone signs up and they aren’t a customer, send them an email asking about what made them interested in your product. Here are a few other questions you could ask:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What made you interested in our product?</li>
<li class="p1">What were you looking to do with our product?</li>
<li class="p1">What product could we make that you would love?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">And then, allow people to respond, and then respond back to them. Start real conversations with your customers. Get to know them, and work with them to better your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, if you already have a large subscription list (say 10,000 or so), then go ahead and just email them a questions. That&#8217;s a great way to show them you’re actually listening. That&#8217;s how you&#8217;re going to build customers for life.</p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s say you have a tent business, like hammock.com in Austin. Email your customers and ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Where&#8217;s the next place you want to adventure? We&#8217;re going to pay $500 for someone to go on their next camping trip.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">You get all these people talking about it with you and around the web. You can then take that content, those questions and answers, create blog posts and copy for your landing pages or product pages. It all has a much longer life than just in your email.</p>
<p class="p1">That&#8217;s what I do. People ask me all their questions, things I had never thought about in those ways. Then, I create content that addresses those particular questions and needs –- the same way you would for your spouse or friend.</p>

<h2 class="p3">What One Hundred Million Emails Taught Me Not to Do</h2>
<p class="p1">At <a href="https://sumo.com/">Sumo</a>.com, we’ve sent more than a hundred million emails in the past six years. In that time, we have tried absolutely everything.</p>
<p class="p1">In terms of what I’ve learned in doing that, let’s start with first things first. No matter how many emails you have on your subscription list, nothing will matter if you have a terrible product. Email marketing only helps you if you have a product people are desiring.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s the first step to making sure your emails get opened: <em>have something people want.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Once you have that taken care of, step two is a bit easier: stop stressing so much about what and when you send them. Here are the three biggest lessons I’ve learned to back that up.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Segmentation Doesn’t Matter</h3>
<p class="p1">A couple years ago, we bought this custom segmentation algorithm and spent tons of time ramping it up to send specific emails to specific segments at specific times. It cost us a lot of money and a lot of time.</p>
<p class="p1">And in the end, it didn&#8217;t do much. That was when I realized that segmentation is not as important as people think.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, we send two types of emails:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Personal emails from our personal accounts</li>
<li class="p1">Mass emails educating our customer base</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">That’s it, and then we focus on making sure that #2 email has the highest possible open rates.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Think Long-Term, Not Just About the Profit</h3>
<p class="p1">In our early days, we A/B tested our templates all the time. We were looking at the RPM (revenue per thousands emails sent) constantly. And that revenue number was going up.</p>
<p class="p1">The problem didn’t present until much later. Those emails with high RPM had all these upsells and were very gimmicky. They made more money at first, but over time, they begin to hurt the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-branding/">loyalty and respect of our brand</a>. In the long term, it hurt more than it helped.</p>
<p class="p1">Take that lesson and remember to be considerate. A/B test your templates and work to increase your RPM, but do so with the long-term goal in mind. Too much gimmicky language and too many discounts or upsells discounts your brand –– and over time, effects that open rate and your relationship with the customer.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Forget About “When” to Send It –– Just Send It</h3>
<p class="p1">People spend too much time thinking about about time of day.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What day should I send it?</li>
<li class="p1">What time should I send it?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This all just comes back to the Spousal Technique –– send an email like you would to your husband or wife. If you&#8217;re sending good stuff, people are going to want to hear from you and you won’t need to worry about time of day. Focus on sending valuable information, asking questions, getting responses and responding yourself. That’s where you should focus your time, not on figuring out the “best time.”</p>
<h2 class="p3">The Biggest Mistake You’re Already Making</h2>
<p class="p1">Now that we’ve got my mistakes out of the way, let’s talk about the number one mistake I see almost all ecommerce brands make in their emails: not enough CTAs.</p>
<p class="p1">So many brands only put a CTA in their email at the end of the email. Come on –– very few people who open that email are going to make it down the page.</p>
<p class="p1">You don’t think like this with your homepage on your site. You know that “above the fold” space is valuable. Don’t make people scroll to get to the part where you want them to take action.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">People are on their phones or in the bathroom</a> (or both!). They&#8217;re busy –– and distracted.</p>
<p class="p1">You need to put your CTA in that email a few times to make sure they see it and can click it.</p>
<p class="p1">Beyond that, make each email about only one desired action. Too many emails have too many various CATs. Some of these emails have 10 or more products featured. That’s way too many. Showcase a few popular ones, or ones that are often bundled together. Then, make sure that all of those CTAs are the same, i.e.: “Buy Now.”</p>
<p class="p1">Don’t have a “Buy Now,” a “Read More” and a “Join the Conversation.” You won’t get anyone to do anything with that many options.</p>
<h2 class="p3">What I’d Do If I Were Starting from Scratch</h2>
<p class="p1">Literally, any time someone starts capturing emails and making money, the number one thing I always hear from them is: “I wish I started this sooner!”</p>
<p class="p1">For most people, you can just throw on Sumo.com, or any list builder software and a few of our tools or whatever tools are out there.</p>
<p class="p1">In six months, you’ll have a decent size list of people you can communicate with about your product. That’s the number one thing to do if you are launching a new business or a new product line: catch emails right away!</p>
<p class="p1">Catch emails right away, make sure the product is really desirable then regularly communicate with your audience.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Four must-do email marketing tips</h3>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Start collecting emails:</strong> Get a landing page up –– better yet, make it a welcome mat. Get it set up today.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Begin to communicate regularly:</strong> Setup an autoresponder for anyone who signs up through that. Have that autoresponder be three emails that go over over the first day, third day, seventh day. People lose attention and open rates go down over time. Most people have already taken the most action they ever will with your brand when they’ve given you their email address. So email them right away to keep that excitement up!</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Make sure the product is desirable:</strong> Spend 80% of your time building a product or service that people are really excited about. Use the landing page and autoresponder to tease the product, but then begin collecting feedback. This all goes back to my #1 rule: email won’t work if you have a terrible product. So, make sure your product isn’t terrible!</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Craft a community from day one:</strong> Link your landing page in your email signature. Send it to friends and family. Get a Facebook page launched and start promoting that, and create not just a business page, but a community. Ask questions. Engage with your audience. Figure out exactly what the product needs to be to get them really excited.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Here’s a more tangible example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Say I&#8217;m thinking about starting a gum company called Noah&#8217;s Chew. If I was starting Noah&#8217;s Chew, I would spend an hour setting up the domain, putting on <a href="https://sumo.com/">Sum</a>o.com with the Welcome Mat and then I would link it in my email signature and say: “Hey, if you like gum –– go here!” to begin collecting emails.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, I would spend the rest of the time making a really great product and sharing those updates with the customers. When the product is ready, I have 1,000 hungry people that will chew on whatever gum I&#8217;m sending out.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p3">How to Build a Bigger List</h2>
<h3 class="p4">People who buy or want to buy</h3>
<p class="p1">Clearly add anyone who buys your product to your email marketing list. You&#8217;d be surprised how many people don&#8217;t do that simple and obvious thing.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, whenever you sell out of something, make sure you have an email collect on the product page.</p>
<p class="p7" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/out-of-stock-offer.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20786" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/out-of-stock-offer.png" alt="" width="640" height="310" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/out-of-stock-offer.png 1430w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/out-of-stock-offer-300x145.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/out-of-stock-offer-750x363.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>In the above example, So Suzy Stamps is using the app InStockNotify, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/instocknotify/">which you can install here</a>. According to Suzy, 80% of people who sign up for these emails end up purchasing.</em></p>
<h3 class="p4">Exit Attempt</h3>
<p class="p1">I highly recommend an Exit Attempt Pop Up so if someone is leaving your site, you can say, “Hey, before you leave, let me tell you about our next deal.” You can offer:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Discounts</li>
<li class="p1">Behind the scenes information</li>
<li class="p1">Sneak peaks</li>
</ul>
<p class="p7" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/exit-intent-offer.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20787" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/exit-intent-offer.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/exit-intent-offer.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/exit-intent-offer-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/exit-intent-offer-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Atlanta Light Bulbs is using <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/name-your-price-pricewaiter/">PriceWaiter, a BigCommerce app</a>, to serve the exit intent popup. PriceWaiter also serves up the The Let’s Make a Deal feature with which Atlanta Light Bulbs has seen a 30+% increase in conversion rate.</em></p>
<h3 class="p4">Welcome Mat</h3>
<p class="p1">We have a tool called the Welcome Mat that has been really successful for a lot of brands. This is essentially a landing page that is styled very similarly to your own site, but offers only 1 CTA rather than your homepage which is merchandised.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is Sheer Miracle’s Welcome Mat (image 1) and then their actual homepage (image 2).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/welcome-mat.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20278" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/welcome-mat.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/welcome-mat.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/welcome-mat-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/welcome-mat-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/welcome-mat-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20279" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/welcome-mat-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/welcome-mat-1.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/welcome-mat-1-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/welcome-mat-1-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Here, you can ask for an email, offer a discount and work to grab the email up front rather than having to wait until they are about to leave.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Receipt emails</h3>
<p class="p1">Add email opt in options and product recommendations on your receipt emails with a tool like Converio. Say, “Hey, join our newsletter or forward this to a friend and get 10% off!”  That’s worked really well for us.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Increase sales by 5% right now</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/conversio/">Install Conversio</a> and begin optimizing your receipt emails for free right now.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">Click Triggers</h3>
<p class="p1">One thing I&#8217;ve seen a lot of ecommerce sites do really, really effectively is give discounts for just new customers.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s a pretty standard practice. You can use Content Upgrades or Click Triggers, both which are just buttons a customer clicks to open up a box that says, “Get your 15% off!”</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s an example of a pop-up for 10% off on a first purchase from <a href="https://www.campman.com/">Camp Man</a>.</p>
<p class="p7"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/percent-off-offer.png"><img class="wp-image-20788 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/percent-off-offer.png" alt="" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/percent-off-offer.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/percent-off-offer-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/percent-off-offer-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">How to Make Sure Your Emails Are Working (And What to Do If They Aren’t)</h2>
<p class="p1">Finally, you want to make sure that your emails are working to increase sales and engagement. If you&#8217;re sending a sales email once a month and you&#8217;re not generating any sales, you need to figure out why not.</p>
<p class="p1">What I recommend is emailing all the people who opened and did not buy. In that email, say, “Hey, quick question!  Why didn&#8217;t you buy anything?”</p>
<p class="p1">People loved to be asked for their opinion, so let them spill it to you. You’ll learn a ton about what isn’t working and what you can incorporate into future emails to make them more successful. Plus, you’ve created a better relationship with your customers in the meantime.</p>
<p class="p1">And do this every single time something doesn’t work. People love consistency. For your own business, in order to grow, you’ll need to be able to consistently predict how you’ll be doing in a month or two. Consistency matters –– both for you and for your customers. So begin that cadence now.</p>
<p class="p1">If an email isn’t working, set the expectation that you will ask your customers why not, and then you will incorporate their feedback to make it better. This is the communication loop that makes email marketing your highest revenue and engagement channel in ecommerce.</p>

<p class="p1">Bounce Exchange is the <a href="https://www.inc.com/tess-townsend/inc5000-2016-new-york-bounce-exchange.html">7th fastest growing business in the U.S</a>.

<p class="p1">After analyzing billions of impressions, with the people-based approach to landing page optimization, BounceX has found that brands see a 10-15% lift in conversion rate, on average.</p>
<p class="p1">Those findings have been critical to how BounceX has grown over the last few years – earning it the <a href="https://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2016">position #7 on the Inc. 5000 list</a> of 2016.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is exactly how we thought through it, and how ecommerce brands can work to see similar success.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Don’t judge a book by its cover”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">A short piece of wisdom we have all heard and, most likely, are all guilty of doing anyway.</p>
<p class="p1">But don’t feel too bad, because, apparently, we can’t actually help it.</p>
<p class="p1">As humans, we are <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-world/201208/judging-book-its-cover">predominantly visual creatures</a>, meaning that “wrappers in which things come not only powerfully affect what interests us but also how we react to the contents we find inside.”</p>
<p class="p1">We can’t help but judge books by their covers, food by its appearance, and, most importantly, brands by their landing pages.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, ecommerce landing pages represent a very neglected but increasingly crucial brand wrapper &#8212; a key initial impression and touchpoint for many new shoppers.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Landing pages are a neglected but increasingly crucial brand wrapper &#8211; a key initial impression and touchpoint for many new shoppers.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">And even for those returning ones, ecommerce landing pages can play an important role in motivating traffic to continue engaging with your brand and ultimately convincing them to make a purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Even more unfortunate is the fact that while brands today spend large portions of their marketing budget driving traffic to their digital storefronts, that paid traffic rarely reaches its full potential — as evidenced by subpar conversion rates. That untapped value is a consequence of disjointed onsite experiences coupled with the simple truth that consumers judge brands based on their preliminary experiences, abandoning them in response.</p>
<p class="p1">So, considering these two factors:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">The key role that initial landing page impression can play in the consumer journey</li>
<li class="p1">The painful fact that, as long as that traffic isn’t purchasing, you are likely going to have to pay for them again and again until they do</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Why not do everything you in your power to ensure that your landing page experiences are as seamless (and as revenue-driving) as possible?</p>
<p class="p1">This blog post will walk you through why landing pages are becoming increasingly important to positive and profitable ecommerce customer experiences in addition to explaining what you can do to optimize the value of yours –– right now.</p>

<p class="p1">Get the insider tricks of the landing page trade from Bounce Exchange, the landing page business that grew 14,757% in just 3 years.  <a href="http://convert.bouncex.com/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-landing-page-webinar.html?utm_source=bigcommerce&amp;utm_medium=registrationform&amp;utm_campaign=partnerwebinar">Sign up for the webinar “The Anatomy of a Perfect Landing Page”</a> on Tuesday May 2.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">What is a Landing Page?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A landing page is a standalone webpage targeted to a specific cohort of your traffic, with the aim of providing a more relevant experience in order to achieve the ultimate objective of driving that cohort toward conversion</span><b>.</b></p>
<p class="p1">According to Wikipedia, a landing page can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page">defined</a> as a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“single page that appears in response to clicking on a search result or online advertisement.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The definition and application varies from organization to organization. </span></p>
<p class="p1">The real and long-term goal of landing pages, as I see it however, is one that Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos envisioned back in 1999:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“We have 6.2 million customers, we should have 6.2 million storefronts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">In other words, because every customer is unique and requires different types of attention and engagement to be convinced to purchase, businesses should adapt accordingly by <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-personalization/">tailoring their stores to each of those individual customers</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Enter landing pages.</p>
<p class="p1">While retailers can’t be expected to actually create unique websites for every user, they can create unique digital storefronts. Landing pages represent the tool through which brands can adapt to the user in question, creating relevant and positive-impression making experiences for each of the individuals engaging with your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Think <a href="https://think.bouncex.com/article/what-is-people-based-marketing/">People-Based Marketing</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Sure, it is a marketing buzzword, but it is a buzzword for a reason. By taking a customer-first approach to your landing page optimization strategy, you will do more than create impactful landing pages that guide your traffic in the precise direction you want them to go. You will simultaneously unlock incremental value from each of those individuals, driving higher returns for your business as a result.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Put These Steps Into Action</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Do you have questions about landing pages? <a href="http://convert.bouncex.com/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-landing-page-webinar.html?utm_source=bigcommerce&amp;utm_medium=registrationform&amp;utm_campaign=partnerwebinar">Sign up for our webinar “The Anatomy of a Perfect Landing Page”</a> co-hosted by BounceX and BigCommerce. It’s on Tuesday May 2, at 2PM EST. By the end of it you will be a People-Based, Landing Page pro with more revenue filling out your bottom line.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">People-Based Landing Pages: You <em>almost</em> already have them</h2>
<p class="p1">So, naturally, you want to board the landing page train as soon as possible. But the fact of the matter is that you already sort of have.</p>
<p class="p1">Every page on your website that a customer lands on is, in effect, a landing page.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your homepage</li>
<li class="p1">Your category pages</li>
<li class="p1">Your product pages</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These all represent a place where an individual can enter your website. They just are not people-based landing pages &#8212; not yet, anyway.</p>
<p class="p1">In the past, consumer journeys online have been completely linear. Every time a user wanted to engage with your brand, they had to begin with the homepage, navigate to a category page, and then to a product page, building their conversion momentum as they moved deeper into the website.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result, nearly every consumer journey began with an introduction (or a reintroduction) to the brand itself. Just read any post or guide about <a href="http://www.pixus.uk/blog/importance-good-homepage/">homepage optimization</a>.  It will tell you that “the homepage serves as the first impression for a new visitor and generally it will be the page that receives the most traffic.”</p>
<p class="p1">But this is just not always true any more.</p>
<p class="p1">If you take a quick look into your website analytics, you will likely notice that a few product pages rank near the top or even above the homepage.</p>
<p class="p1">This stems from the fact that consumer journeys today have changed dramatically. They are no longer linear. Instead, they have become increasingly fragmented and will only continue to become more so as more channels and new points of brand engagement become available.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20752" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="279" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-2.jpg 900w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-2-300x131.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-2-750x327.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<h2 class="p3">4 Steps to Implementing a People-Based Landing Page Strategy</h2>
<p class="p1">Today, shoppers can arrive at your ecommerce site through a plethora of unique channels after engaging through any number of different messages or searching for any given term or product.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">They might click through a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/facebook/sell-shoes/">Facebook ad for shoes</a>, landing on your website in the shoes category</li>
<li class="p1">Or, they might click through a marketing email that takes them directly to a specific product page</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">They can also land on any page type at any given moment during any point in their conversion journey.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">That Facebook user may have been targeted with a Lookalike ad, landing on that site for the very first time</li>
<li class="p1">Whereas that email user could have received a product recommendation email after making a first purchase</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In other words, two very different types of shoppers &#8212; a new prospect and a returning customer &#8212; can have the exact same brand experience.</p>
<p class="p1">Not ideal.</p>
<p class="p1">Consequently, the brand impression and value illustrated on the homepage is often lost to these shoppers entering the website from Product Listing Ads, AdWords, cart abandonment ads, category sale emails, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">They are simply dropped off on any page of the website, left to either convert or not convert.</p>
<p class="p1">So while you do have landing pages &#8212; they are not yet optimized for a revenue-driving and People-Based strategy. But we promise to get you on board the people-based landing page train.</p>
<p class="p1">Just follow the below four steps.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Step 1: Create undeniable value on every page</h3>
<p class="p1">In a world where every consumer has an infinite number of options for nearly any given product at their fingertips &#8212; where <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenkusek/2016/07/25/the-death-of-brand-loyalty-cultural-shifts-mean-its-gone-forever/#def64354ddec">Forbes</a> whispers of the death of loyalty &#8212; ensuring that your visitors understand why they should buy from your brand is crucial.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, that undeniable value that sets your brand apart from the rest is very rarely clear outside of the homepage or the About Us page.</p>
<p class="p1">Just look at this standard product landing page template that almost every ecommerce retailer uses.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20753" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png 1025w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1-300x195.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1-750x487.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><em>Note: This is not a BigCommerce site. You can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">view all of BigCommerce&#8217;s optimized themes, templates and landing pages here</a>. Industry leaders like <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/ecommerce/bigcommerce">Theme Forest have also designed optimized themes for BigCommerce customers</a>. </em></p>
<p class="p1">The problem here isn’t actually with the template, but with what most ecommerce retailers do (or don’t do) with that template.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about the new visitor engaging with a Facebook Lookalike product ad for sandals.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">She clicks through the ad and lands directly on a product page that probably looks similar to the templated one above.</li>
<li class="p1">She sees the sandals, they’re cute, but she could probably get similar ones on Amazon for a cheaper price.</li>
<li class="p1">And finally, she clicks back and continues browsing Facebook.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">What wasn’t clear to this new user when she landed on the product page was all the details that would have likely motivated her to engage further:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">an expiring promotion on sandals or free shipping, returns, and exchanges</li>
<li class="p1">or the fact that for every pair purchased, another pair is donated to a woman in need</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In other words, since the home page is no longer the sole landing page, it is up to you to ensure every page on your website resonates with value.</p>
<p class="p1">And why shouldn’t it?</p>
<p class="p1">Most retailers have specific value propositions &#8212; whether <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/value-based-ecommerce-pricing-strategy/">price</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/create-a-returns-and-exchanges-policy-that-sells/">return policy</a>, brand story, or social responsibility. Those elements are a part of your business for a reason, why not share them with your consumers, especially if they will drive value for your business in return.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few examples of product pages that include valuable information typically on Homepage or About Us pages –– and how these retailers weave in those storylines.</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="p6">Step 2: Make it easy</h3>
<p class="p1">We’ll be hosting an in-depth webinar about “<a href="http://convert.bounceexchange.com/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-landing-page-webinar.html?utm_source=bigcommerce&amp;utm_medium=partner-referral&amp;utm_campaign=anatomy-lp">The Anatomy of a Perfect Landing Page</a>” next Tuesday May 2nd at 2PM EST, but for the sake of this post, what it really boils down to is the <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/great-websites-pass-the-3-second-rule/">3-Second Rule</a>, or the theory that you have roughly 3 seconds the capture a visitor’s attention.</p>
<p class="p1">Otherwise, they’re gonezo.</p>
<p class="p1">So, with this in mind, it is crucial to ensure that on every landing page, a consumer can answer the following questions within 3 seconds:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Who you are and what do you do</li>
<li class="p1">Why you are of value or of interest to them</li>
<li class="p1">What they should do next</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Let’s look back at that templated product page we saw earlier.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20753" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png 1025w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1-300x195.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1-750x487.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><em>Note: This is not a BigCommerce site. You can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">view all of BigCommerce&#8217;s optimized themes, templates and landing pages here</a>. Industry leaders like <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/ecommerce/bigcommerce">Theme Forest have also designed optimized themes for BigCommerce customers</a>. </em></p>
<p class="p1">Now, step back, close your eyes, and open them for 3-seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">Can you answer the above three questions?  I can’t &#8212; and not just because this is a templated page.</p>
<p class="p1">Per Step 1, we are already working on ensuring who you are and your value is reflected across every page.</p>
<p class="p1">But what about what they should do next?</p>
<p class="p1">In the above image, that next step is lost in plethora of page distractions. Even the add to cart button is barely visible at the bottom of the page. This type of convoluted landing page design is not conducive to seamlessly making a purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">My eyes even have to move down the page to see the discounted price, and the discount itself is tiny!  Additionally, while the product image is large and clear, I don’t really understand the associated labels. If it’s “HOT” because of the price, shouldn’t that great discount be reflected prominently?</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to making the purchase decision, consumers are flooded with hesitations:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Do I really need it?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it too expensive?</li>
<li class="p1">Could I find it cheaper?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it worth the investment?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">It is up to the landing page to alleviate those hesitations.</p>
<p class="p1">On product pages, this means <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-rock-product-photography-on-a-budget/">ensuring clear product images</a> along with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-ctas/">prominent CTAs</a> and easily understood value propositions.</p>
<p class="p1">On category pages, this means making sure your product images are clear as shoppers scroll through in addition to ensuring customers understand the product offerings.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20751" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-3.png 1326w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-3-300x157.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-3-750x392.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In this example, while scrolling through the category page, a few things are immediately clear:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Value:</strong> Free Sample &amp; Free Shipping and Returns</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product:</strong> Large, clear product images</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product Options:</strong> the “more shades” tags give interested users another reason to click</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Next Step:</strong> persistent “Add to Bag CTA”</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The brand took the idea of motivating the user to take action to the next step. By creating the “Add to Bag” CTA button, they have simplified the checkout process, giving users the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/buy-buttons/">ability to easily add items to their cart</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Ultimately, every ecommerce landing page (and really every page of your website) should be created with the goal of getting your user to take the next-most productive step.</p>
<p class="p1">Once a user has made it to a category or product page, they have essentially told you what they are interested in. It’s up to you and your pages to ensure they are.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Step 3: Identify the right traffic</h3>
<p class="p1">Now that you’ve optimized the general landing page experience across your website, it’s time to take it one step further &#8212; the people-based way.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, it is neither feasible nor wise to try to create people-based landing page experiences for every individual arriving at your website.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, you should focus on the highest-value cohorts of your traffic. These are not only the ones you have invested your budget toward, but they are also the individuals you know you can motivate to take productive action with your business.</p>
<p class="p1">But, how do you identify the right traffic?</p>
<p class="p1">Start by diving into your website analytics, specifically looking into your top traffic sources, not only from a traffic volume perspective but also from a revenue perspective. These sources typically include Email, Paid Search, Organic Search, and Direct, to name a few.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-12.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20757" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-12.png" alt="" width="640" height="483" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-12.png 985w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-12-300x226.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-12-750x566.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Once you have pinpointed those top traffic sources, dig even deeper and look at the specific campaigns responsible.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Do those jumps in traffic arise from specific marketing emails or promotions?</li>
<li class="p1">Are they a result of <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">cart abandonment ads on Facebook</a>?</li>
<li class="p1">Are there specific search terms you have ads for that are just killing it for you?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">By sifting through all of these details, you’ll be able to get a clear understanding of which specific cohorts of traffic are the most valuable to your business.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are using an analytics solution like BigCommerce’s Insights, you can easily see reports that take this a step further. Here is a taste.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Marketing Insights Reports</h3>
<p class="p1">In this section, you can dive into customer lifetime value by channel on day 1, 90 and 180. This will help you understand which channels (AdWords, Email, Facebook, etc.) drive the highest lifelong loyalty and repeat purchase rates.</p>
<p class="p1">What is this helpful for? Understanding where to put your ad dollars to drive consumers back to your product landing pages for purchase.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-10.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20755" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-10.png" alt="" width="640" height="206" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-10.png 1118w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-10-300x97.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-10-750x242.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are the three reports you get.</em></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-9.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20745" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-9.png" alt="" width="640" height="375" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-9.png 1121w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-9-300x176.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-9-750x440.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Here is what the 90 day report looks like, and how you can download the data to further investigate.</em></p>
<h3 class="p1">Product Insights Reports</h3>
<p class="p1">Here, you can dive into which products (and subsequently product landing pages) are performing the best, and which need a little work. This data is pulled based on individual product conversion rate data. So, if its a rockstar product, it is likely a rockstar landing page.</p>
<p class="p1">Further, you can use this data with the Marketing Insights data to understand which products to market for the highest return on ad spend.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-11.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20756" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-11.png" alt="" width="640" height="419" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-11.png 1132w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-11-300x196.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-11-750x491.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Moreover, you can use these insights to see which products are bought together most often. This is a good indicator of what additional products to include on landing pages for upsell opportunities.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Customer Insights Reports</h3>
<p class="p1">With these reports, you can dive into various customer cohorts including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Best customers</li>
<li class="p1">Customers at risk</li>
<li class="p1">Low AOV customers</li>
<li class="p1">Customer lifetime value (30, 90, and 180 days)</li>
<li class="p1">Customer lifetime value by product (day 1, 90 and 180)</li>
<li class="p1">Best products for repeat purchase (By month)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This data is helpful for understanding customer behavior on your site, which products drive loyalty and creating landing pages that best attract high AOV and full-price customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Most useful, however, is to use this data for <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-ads-tips/">retargeting on Facebook</a> to earn more “Best customers” using already known characteristics of that cohort.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the full reports you have access to:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-8.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20746" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-8.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-8.png 1164w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-8-300x190.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-8-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-7.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20747" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-7.png" alt="" width="640" height="413" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-7.png 1146w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-7-300x194.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-7-750x484.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p6">Step 4: Behavioral Marketing</h3>
<p class="p1">Now that you have optimized landing pages and you know who to target, it’s time to bring your landing pages to life, so they can adapt to the specific person in question.</p>
<p class="p1">When any visitor lands on your website, you should be able to detect a couple of things with the proper tagging and a behavioral marketing partner like <a href="https://www.bouncex.com/">BounceX</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">If it’s her first time onsite</li>
<li class="p1">If she came through an ad and what type</li>
<li class="p1">Which ad specifically and the content of that ad</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Since you’ve already identified your most valuable traffic-driving campaigns, you can target the individuals who come through those experiences with behavioral marketing tactics.</p>
<p class="p1">So now, when that new user clicks through your Facebook Lookalike ad and lands on your sandals product page for the first time, two things will occur simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">She’ll likely remain onsite longer because your unique value propositions are clear</li>
<li class="p1">She’ll understand that the sandals are on sale for a limited time only</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Both of these are a result of your on page optimizations. With behavioral marketing, you can add a third element to the optimization process.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s the scenario:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Knowing this shopper is a new prospect who has never purchased from you before, you know she’s going to need slightly more convincing before she agrees to purchase from you and likely won’t make the purchase in her first visit.  </em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So, as she’s clicking through the product images and demonstrating clear interest, you respond to her behavior by offering her ‘Free Shipping’ when she enters her email address.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Now, you’ve not only captured her information in case she abandons but you’ve also given her another reason to buy from you today. It’s people-based marketing, people.</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">Every page on your website is effectively a landing page. And what is a landing page but your chance to make conversion-driving impressions on your valuable visitors?</p>
<p class="p1">So, to put it simply, make sure every page on your website does just that &#8211; instills real interest in each of the consumers arriving at your website (and interest they won’t find on any other ecommerce website). Between refined landing page optimization and some of the best practices listed above, you can vastly improve the value instilled in your visitors.</p>
<p class="p1">From there, get the most value from your landing pages experiences with behavioral marketing and guide your shoppers closer to conversion with every step.</p>

It&#8217;s not your name. It isn’t some meaningless press release out to the world. It&#8217;s more than a strategy laid out in a Google doc.  In fact, branding cannot be seen.</p>
<p class="p1">Branding can only be felt.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about the most amazing companies you have ever interacted with.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Where does that excitement to try on the latest collections <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/flash-tattoos/">Flash Tattoos</a> come from?</li>
<li class="p1">Why do Apple products alleviate stress and allow for a state of delighted bliss?</li>
<li class="p1">What makes you engage with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/rei-optoutside-campaign-bucks-tradition/">REI’s #OptOutside campaign</a> on Twitter, and like, nothing else?</li>
<li class="p1">How is it that you open every. single. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/man-crates/">Man Crates</a> email they send you, even though no giftable holidays are coming up?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is branding. This is business mixed with emotion and engagement and expectation. This is mission and customer participation mixed into one. It encompasses your web presence, communications, and products. It&#8217;s baked into your product details, customer emails, and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-checkout-page-optimization/">shopping cart checkout page</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the difference between brands who “get it” and those which don’t.</p>
<p class="p1">Great branding is the most powerful currency a company can have — your single-greatest competitive advantage. People purchase products because of a story, an emotional connection they feel with a brand.</p>
<p class="p1">As ecommerce owners and managers, building a powerful and engaging brand is our most important work. It is a KPI that cannot be put to paper –– but do it right, and every single goal will be surpassed.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Branding is a KPI that cannot be put to paper –– but do it right, and every single goal will be surpassed.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">And yet, so few brands invest early and often in their branding strategy. In fact, it is often an afterthought of success. Something brands get to when they have enough money and time. But you don’t get the opportunity to make a first impression multiple times. How you present your brand across the web matters –– and it matters from day 1.</p>
<p class="p1">The following best practices are going to sound obvious, but it is exactly the obvious that so many *do not* do. So, beyond the typical best practices, I’ll walk you through specific brand examples that stand out above and beyond the crowd.</p>
<p class="p1">This is how you win customers and beat out the overwhelming competition on the web, whether you are just getting started or about to re-brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s dive in.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>RSVP for the Ecommerce Growth Summit</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Will you be in Chicago for IRCE in June? Us, too! We&#8217;re hosting our first annual Ecommerce Growth Summit, featuring keynote presentations from Mike Ditka, NFL Hall of Fame Coach, Jason Boyce, Co-Founder and CEO of Dazadi, an Inc. 5000 brand, and much, much more.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://grow.bigcommerce.com/summit">Register for the Ecommerce Growth Summit in Chicago this June.</a> Hope to see you there!</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">1. Better serve your customer</h2>
<p class="p1">Always consider who your business is being built for. Remembering the wants and needs of the consumer will dictate your actions as a company and set you on the path of success with your audience.</p>
<p class="p1">If you&#8217;re unsure about who your audience is, you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p class="p1">All too often, many brands forget their audiences and focus on the product or the catalog, potentially missing out on valuable information that can increase sales.</p>
<p class="p1">This can be remedied.</p>
<p class="p1">Take the time to truly reflect on your past purchasers. Look for trends in the analytics and reflect on experiences you&#8217;ve had with your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Your analytics can be very helpful directionally in helping you understand your customer and their relation to your product and brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Looking at your store’s overview data, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">including abandoned cart data</a>, purchase funnel and most popular products is a great place to start.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20714" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc.png" alt="ecommerce branding" width="640" height="401" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc.png 1126w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc-300x188.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc-750x470.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">However, it’s helpful to dive into your customer data even further to really understand their behavior and who they are, enabling you to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/personalized-marketing/">personalize their experience</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Insights-Report">BigCommerce Insights</a> can help you to do this, though other ecommerce analytics platforms may be helpful as well.</p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce Insights cohorts customers for you automatically. You can then export these lists to market specifically to them or to drill down even further into exactly who falls into these categories, what they’ve bought, etc. This segmentation is truly the key to unlocking the potential of your ecommerce brand.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Bohemian Traders Uses BigCommerce Insights to Drive 166% Growth</h3></p>
<p class="p1">“We use BigCommerce Insights quite heavily on a day-to-day basis. In fact, it was a key motivator for us going with BigCommerce over Shopify,” says <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/bohemian-traders/">David Berlach, CEO of Bohemian Traders</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">The Customer cohorts include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Best customers</li>
<li class="p1">Customers at risk</li>
<li class="p1">Viewed by didn’t purchase (both the customer who viewed and the items they didn’t purchase)</li>
<li class="p1">Repeat purchase rate by 30, 60, 90 and 180 days (i.e. 11% of your new customers from December purchased again in 60 days. 3.39% of your new customers from January 2017 purchased again in 30 days, and so on)</li>
<li class="p1">Best full-price customers</li>
<li class="p1">Low AOV customers</li>
<li class="p1">Customer Lifetime Value by 30, 90 and 180 days</li>
<li class="p1">Customer lifetime value by product purchase by day 1, 30, 90 and 180</li>
<li class="p1">Best products for repeat purchase</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In this instance, I want to know which of my customers are sticking around the longest, and which products are helping them to do that. To see that, let’s take a quick look at Best Product for Repeat Purchase.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20672" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="397" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-1.png 1120w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-1-750x465.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>This is the cohort view for those who purchased in December, and again by March.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20673" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights.png" alt="" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights.png 1135w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-300x180.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>This is the cohort view for those who purchased in January, and again by March.</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What can this data tell you about your customers and your brand?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it that customers buy with you again at the 90 day mark?</li>
<li class="p1">Or, are your customers most often gift-buyers, meaning they drop off in January and don’t repurchase until the next major holiday (maybe Mother’s Day or Father’s Day)?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Those are questions only you can answer, and often, you will need more data to do so. But these analytics point you in the right direction and get you asking the correct questions so you can better serve your customers, increase your revenue and develop your ecommerce brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Use these to look for patterns that clearly point to the heart of your business, that is, why people buy your products.</p>
<p class="p1">Take these buying behaviors and their demographics and reverse engineer your ideal customer.</p>
<h2 class="p3">2. Share your story</h2>
<p class="p1">Tales have been told throughout the history of mankind. As people, we are better suited to remember and emotionally connect with others through storytelling than any other medium.</p>
<p class="p1">You must tell the story of your brand, and you must tell it in a way that builds trust with prospective customers and allows them a glimpse into the oft hidden life of your business.</p>
<p class="p1">So, tell your start-up story!</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Why do you exist? Seriously, why are you even in business?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">There are hundreds of thousands of online businesses. Why should someone choose to give you their money?</p>
<p class="p1">Those are serious questions –– and every single new customer on your ecommerce site is going to be asking them. Sure, some products may make them fall in love and win their conversion long before they care about who you are, but for the most part, customers want to know you. Just like you want to know them.</p>
<p class="p1">So, tell them!</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Call out why you started the business</li>
<li class="p1">Who you are</li>
<li class="p1">What you care about</li>
<li class="p1">What you stand for</li>
<li class="p1">Why you stand for it</li>
<li class="p1">Anything else that matters</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Here are a few good examples of brand storytelling in action:</p>

<h2 class="p3">3. Champion change</h2>
<p class="p1">What does your company stand for? Every brand is built around a certain set of ideals. Convey these to the world. Customers should understand your brand promise – and why it matters.</p>
<p class="p1">Build a following of faithful fans dedicated your cause. People will join in the fight when they find a vision which matches their own and will associate your company with the efforts of hope.</p>
<p class="p1">Be sure to champion this change not just on your About Us page, but absolutely everywhere. This is part of your brand.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">4. Extreme expectations</h2>
<p class="p1">Never over-promise on your company. People absolutely hate disappointment. You do not want your ecommerce branding to be associated with false promises.</p>
<p class="p1">Creating an untenable situation where you promise more than you can always deliver will alienate your audience and destroy the trust you worked so ardently to attain.</p>
<p class="p1">This is most noticeable in return and shipping policies. Here, be honest and forthright about your capabilities. You might not be able to do Amazon-like speed, but honesty will take you much further than a negative review.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, your return and shipping policies don’t need to be fancy. They just need to be clear and honest.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few good examples.</p>

<p class="p1">Including a Q&amp;A section on your return and shipping policy page helps to address any additional or common customer questions (and provide relief from calls). It is also good for SEO, helping your brand to rank higher in search results — and helping your customers answer the questions that may be preventing them from pulling the trigger on a purchase.</p>

<h2 class="p3">5. Define your market, and focus exclusively on them</h2>
<p class="p1">This is possibly the most powerful of all pieces of branding. By tailoring your solution, messaging and marketing to your customer, you instantly eliminate the hassle and heartache of pleasing all.</p>
<p class="p1">This means, again, that you need to define your market and then speak to that market in a way that resonates with them. Develop your brand persona and understand <em>who</em> they are — and are not.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/target-market-analysis/">Not everyone is your target market</a>, and not everyone needs to like your messaging. It is important only that it resonates with your target audience.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a couple of examples.</p>
<h3 class="p6"><a href="https://www.ninelineapparel.com/">Nine Line’s</a> Patriotic Stance</h3>
<p class="p1">First things first, to pull off a great brand, you need to honestly believe in that brand and likely live that lifestyle yourself. Nine Line is a great example of this. The founder is a veteran, hires veterans and speak directly to veterans and other folks who identify as patriotic. The brand awareness practically takes care of itself with such a defined audience.</p>
<p class="p1">This messaging is clear throughout the entire website, and their footprint across the web. It is resonating even in their philanthropic arm, where they support wounded veterans and provide monetary support for medical needs.</p>
<p class="p1">And clearly, this works. Nine Line is one of the top 5 fastest growing retailers in the U.S., according to Inc. magazine.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-nine-line.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20684" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-nine-line.png" alt="online store" width="640" height="2365" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-nine-line.png 1413w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-nine-line-300x1108.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-nine-line-750x2771.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">From their product images to their messaging in their email marketing, Man Crates is funny –– if you like that kind of stuff.

<p class="p1">Their audience of people who buy gifts for men include friends, family and particularly, wives and girlfriends. So, who do you talk to gift buyers in a way that convinces them their recipient will love it?</p>

<h2 class="p3">6. Reflect, refine and get advice</h2>
<p class="p1">Work to refine your ideal customer and place yourself in their shoes.</p>
<p class="p1">What challenges do you, the customer, face?</p>
<p class="p1">Use that questions to figure out how you can build trust and truly add value to their lives. With a narrow view of your target market, this becomes infinitely easier and more successful.</p>
<p class="p1">In an indirect way, refining your brand can be the single most impactful action you can take to improve your conversion rate.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is how 28 ecommerce experts recommend you think about branding to provide value, target your market and ultimately create a brand no one can forget.</p>

<p class="p1">The key to great branding is knowing how your customers view you compared to the competition. This is more commonly known as positioning.</p>
<p class="p1">From there, you can create a value statement that demonstrates how you are different.</p>
<p class="p1">A simple formula you can use is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I help (target audience) solve (burning pain) by (your solution).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">For example, my agency&#8217;s statement is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I help ecommerce entrepreneurs connect with influencers so they can rapidly grow their business together.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">Branding is not about a fancy logo or colors. It is actually what people think after seeing or interacting with your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">In order to drive a positive perception about your brand, you need to focus on driving in consistent benefits in pre-purchase marketing and over-deliver on customer experience.</p>
<p class="p1">This will enable you build a core customer base of raving fans for your brand.</p>

<p class="p1">Be consistent. An ecommerce site should be built in accordance with a brand’s brand standards guide. If a brand doesn’t have one, that’s the first place they should start.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not just the site colors and the logo, either.</p>
<p class="p1">Brands must be consistent in the tone of their copy and the overall user experience of the site. For example, if a brand touts its customer service in its messaging, a thousand word dissertation as a return policy for the site isn’t consistent with that.</p>

<p class="p1">With so many ecommerce brands out there offering similar or identical products, customers have increasing expectations. A brand with a strong ‘why’ provides consumers something to believe in. A by-product of belief is loyalty from customers, which gives you the competitive edge.</p>
<p class="p1">Branding isn’t just about an identity or logo &#8211; it’s your marketing messages, your tone-of-voice, how you present yourselves, how you deliver and respond to your customers, and much more. It is the mental picture your customers visualise of your company and whether or not it resonates with them.</p>
<p class="p1">From our experience, the No.1 peice of advice for ecommerce businesses in regards to branding is to ‘stay true’.</p>
<p class="p1">You will have this brand (hopefully) for many, many years. You can evolve, scale, innovate and harness new technology, but staying true with what you stand for as a brand will support your internal vision and external perceptions, increase customer following and loyalty, and help make the right decisions much quicker.</p>

<p class="p1">A brand is a wonderful cocktail of your reputation mixed with the gut feel someone has about your company, products or even its founders. To shape your brand, it means focusing not on just information, but appealing to site visitors emotions.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are two tools to shape how people think about you are Meaning and Story:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Is there something meaningful you can express?</li>
<li class="p1">Is there a backstory or an aspirational feeling you can provide quickly that will wrap your offering in an aura much larger than a simple ecommerce transaction?</li>

<p class="p1">Visual Identity is one of the most important aspects of the front-facing commerce business. Without clear direction on visual styling, typography, font selection, or color use, the brand begins to create confusion without even realizing it.</p>
<p class="p1">Leverage an expert in this process, as design and branding are tightly wound with psychology. Understanding the target demographic, as well as customer intention, can help focus designers on creating memorable visual experiences; and that recognition can last a lifetime.</p>

<p class="p1">Create an experience. Millennials are more brand loyal than you think, but they expect more than just advertising to keep their interest. If you can’t provide value outside of your product offering, you won’t keep their attention.</p>
<p class="p1">Drive engagement with content that adds value to their day and supports the lifestyle your brand represents. Video/UGC/tutorials/lifestyle articles –– it all add value and support your brand’s image.</p>
<p class="p1">Keeping the attention and subsequently, the conversions, of the largest consumer group is no longer just “nice to have,” it is a necessity if brands are going to compete.</p>

<p class="p1">Look at a handful of random ecommerce website’s &#8216;About Us&#8217; pages.</p>

<p class="p1">Therefore, my main advice here is to know your audience well. Know what excites them, what values they treasure. Do market research, collect data, see what your competitors do and how you can be different.</p>
<p class="p1">And do that again, and again and again. That’s how you’ll stay ahead.</p>

<p class="p1">Brand names are not &#8220;established&#8221; in a day. It requires a lot of strategic marketing and promotions, before the brand name becomes recognized.</p>
<p class="p1">Ecommerce businesses should not leave out any avenue for promoting their brand. Social media is a very strong avenue these days to make or break a brand. Promote your products on the social, keep your target audience &#8220;engaged&#8221; and follow up sales with strong customer support.</p>
<p class="p1">The brand becomes bigger through &#8220;word of mouth&#8221; also in the ecommerce age. Here are a few tips to help you along:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Keep the message simple.</strong> It should be easy to understand, effortless comprehension</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use hashtags.</strong> This allows prospective followers / buyers can “find” your products easily, and with time can become loyal to your brand. Eg: #handmadegifts / #glassjewellery / #pearlnecklace / #giftsforher / #exquisitexmasornaments could be few suggestions for a shop selling handmade glass ornaments targeted at female buying audience</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Design a communication strategy</strong>, and follow it! Brands are established over a period of time –– and a plan will help you to march closer to that date in the future.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Invest in images</strong>. Images get more views in any media, and increase the chances of traffic directing to your estore, building brand recognition.</li>

<p class="p1">Serious ecommerce businesses have to build branding to create brand loyalty in order to acquire brand equity and attract a bunch of money.</p>
<p class="p1">Whether it is a traditional business or today&#8217;s ecommerce brands, the most valuable asset for building a branding are visual. Visuals include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">logo</li>
<li class="p1">colors</li>
<li class="p1">fonts</li>
<li class="p1">photos</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The human brain processes images and remembers them forever. Brands can use photos to create the right image of their brands in their consumers&#8217; minds. Investing on building the visual assets, especially photos, will pay off in terms of branding and faster than any other investment made on the textual brand strategy.</p>

<p class="p1">Develop more than a brand. Craft a worldview for your company, including a set of values, commercial goals, and social interests, and infuse all content and communications with this worldview.</p>
<p class="p1">Then identify a circle of influencers in line with that worldview and see what brands impact their social outreach. It never hurts to see what the successful brands do right, then model your efforts after theirs.</p>

<p class="p1">Spend the time and the money to develop your brand. With Amazon selling virtually everything, you need to have a value proposition and brand message that stands out and gives a customer a reason to go through the hassle of ordering from you instead of a one-click Amazon purchase.</p>

<p class="p1">The #1 piece of advice for ecommerce business in regards to branding is to have a cohesive look all across your social media platforms and blog.</p>
<p class="p1">As tempting as it can be to post that puppy picture, if it’s not relevant to your niche don&#8217;t post it.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">Building a truly great brand and creating a close relationship with the target customer is an art in and of itself. This crucial piece of the ecommerce puzzle is what separates the “haves and have nots” in the industry.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>58.6%</strong> –– that’s the percentage of people who say they’ve abandoned a cart within the last 3 months because <em>“I was just browsing / not ready to buy.”</em> These people likely won’t ever even initiate your checkout flow.</p>
<p class="p1">But for the 41.6% of other abandoned carts, many people will begin your checkout flow. Why does this matter? Because when a consumer begins your checkout flow, they must first enter their email. And, when you have their email, you can trigger an abandoned cart series to bring that customer back and earn their sale.</p>

<h2 class="p3">These Stats Show the Top Reasons for Shopping Cart Abandonment</h2>
<p class="p1">Outside of the 58.6% of people who abandon cart because they simply aren’t ready to buy, here is the Baymard Institute’s breakdown of alternative abandon cart reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">61%: Extra costs (shipping, taxes, fees) were too high</li>
<li class="p1">35%: Didn’t want to create an account</li>
<li class="p1">27%: The checkout process was too long or complicated</li>
<li class="p1">24%: Couldn’t see or calculate total order cost up-front</li>
<li class="p1">22%: Reported the website had errors or crashed.</li>
<li class="p1">18% Didn’t trust the site with their credit card information</li>
<li class="p1">16%: Delivery timeline was much too slow</li>
<li class="p1">10%: Didn’t believe the returns policy to be fair or satisfactory</li>
<li class="p1">8%: Didn’t see their preferred method of payment</li>
<li class="p1">5%: Their credit card was declined</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Here’s the full graph.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-chart-baymard.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20557" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-chart-baymard.jpg" alt="shopping cart abandonment stats" width="640" height="414" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-chart-baymard.jpg 1536w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-chart-baymard-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-chart-baymard-750x485.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Now, many of those issues can be fixed simply with a few design changes.</p>
<p class="p1">For instance, to address the need to create an account, your checkout should allow consumers to checkout as guests.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-desktop-optimzied-checkout.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20562" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-desktop-optimzied-checkout.png" alt="abandoned cart emails" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-desktop-optimzied-checkout.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-desktop-optimzied-checkout-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-desktop-optimzied-checkout-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Or, to address a long or complicated checkout process (which is a particular complaint on mobile), make sure your checkout is only one page, and optimized for browser type.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is that above checkout experience in mobile view:</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-mobile-optimized-checkout.png"><img class="wp-image-20563 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-mobile-optimized-checkout.png" alt="cart abandonment emails" width="395" height="748" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-mobile-optimized-checkout.png 395w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-mobile-optimized-checkout-300x568.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Here is another example of a one-page checkout, both of desktop and on mobile.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-one-page-checkout.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20564" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-one-page-checkout.png" alt="abandonment rate" width="640" height="324" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-one-page-checkout.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-one-page-checkout-300x152.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-one-page-checkout-750x380.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Desktop one-page checkout.</em></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-mobile-one-page-checkout.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20560" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-mobile-one-page-checkout.png" alt="abandoned cart email tips" width="400" height="2368" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-mobile-one-page-checkout.png 400w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-mobile-one-page-checkout-300x1776.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>The same one-page checkout, now on mobile, implemented by BigCommerce partner Intuit Solutions.</em></p>
<p class="p1">By and large however, the #1 reason for shopping cart abandonment beyond a customer just not being ready to buy is price.</p>
<p class="p1">And this, you can completely control –– and is a mainstay of abandoned cart nurture streams that will help you win back a sale you would have otherwise lost.</p>
<h2 class="p4">The Science of Abandoned Cart Emails</h2>
<p class="p1">In this post, we’ll be talking mainly about how to reduce that abandonment rate of 61% and turn it into sales. Let’s do the math here really quickly.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Let’s say we have 100 abandoned carts –– and 41 of them (just to round it out) abandon because of reasons other than not being ready to purchase.</em></p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-math-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20558" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-math-1.png" alt="abandoned cart software" width="640" height="326" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-math-1.png 779w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-math-1-300x153.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-math-1-750x382.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Because in the <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">Baymard Institute survey</a>, consumers could choose multiple reasons why they abandoned cart, we cannot evenly break down exactly how many people abandoned cart solely because of final price point in checkout.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>However, because 61% of 41 is about 25 –– we can estimate that 25 of those surveyed said they abandoned cart after seeing the final price. That makes 25% of our total not checking out because of final shipping, fees or taxes price points.</em></p>
<p class="p3" style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-math.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20559" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-math.png" alt="how to save abandoned carts" width="640" height="324" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-math.png 782w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-math-300x152.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-math-750x380.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Knowing that average abandoned cart emails win back 12-15% of consumers –– and that personalized emails are 6x more effective than regular emails –– we’re already pretty close to hitting average win back revenue.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Now that we have that out of the way, let’s start from the beginning.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Calculate Your Abandoned Cart Revenue Increase</h3></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p4">What are Abandoned Cart Emails?</h2>
<p class="p1">Abandoned cart emails are a series of reminder emails sent to customers who have initiated your checkout flow, provided an email address, and failed to make a purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">The emails will trigger based on rules you set up, and will feature the content left in their cart.</p>
<p class="p1">Typically, brands send three emails –– the first hours after the abandoned cart, a follow up email the next day and a third the next day. A variety of content goes into these emails in an attempt to win a customer back.</p>
<h2 class="p4">How do I set up Abandoned Cart Emails?</h2>
<p class="p1">Ecommerce software providers like BigCommerce offer their own out-of-the-box abandoned cart series.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is where you set up abandoned carts on the backend. Notice you can set up as many as you would like, though 3 are recommended.</p>

<p class="p1">Here is where you can customize the email and include coupon codes as necessary. We’ll cover the importance of this and what we recommend in a bit.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20504" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email.png 1134w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-300x180.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And here is an example of what the out-of-the-box abandoned cart emails look like.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20524" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1" width="640" height="397" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1.png 971w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1-750x466.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Tons of online brands use these out-of-the-box abandoned cart emails, and see incredible success. For instance, <a href="http://www.silkroadteas.com/">Silk Road Teas</a> sees <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/silk-road-teas/">17% of customers</a> who have abandoned cart come back to purchase.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Our B2C site now has a steady 4.5% conversion rate, and BigCommerce’s out-of-the-box Abandoned Cart Saver has 17% of those who abandon cart coming back to buy.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">But let’s be honest here –– these out-of-the-box emails aren’t the prettiest, even if they work well. Doug Root, CEO of <a href="http://www.atlantalightbulbs.com/">Atlanta Light Bulbs</a> explains it best.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We use BigCommerce’s Abandoned Cart feature. We&#8217;ve tried some other ones, too. That&#8217;s the thing. You know, the abandoned cart feature on BigCommerce works functionally really well, but it&#8217;s just not as sexy as some of the other ones with making some cool graphics or doing some cool stuff. It is one of the best I&#8217;ve found in that it gets the best results.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">The benefit of this approach is that all data is captured in your store backend.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20496" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1" width="640" height="392" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1.png 1127w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1-300x184.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1-750x460.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">That said, depending on your brand, you may want to use other email providers to enable this functionality –– and really get at those cool graphics.</p>
<p class="p1">One such provider is <a href="http://www.klaviyo.com/">Klaviyo</a>. Here is an example of what our out-of-the-box abandoned cart email looks like.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-klaviyo-example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20561" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-klaviyo-example.png" alt="abandoned-cart-klaviyo-example" width="637" height="861" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-klaviyo-example.png 637w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-klaviyo-example-300x405.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Immediately, you’ll see difference here.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">The photo is larger as is the call-to-action.</li>
<li class="p1">The platform recommends additional products in order to cross or up-sell.</li>
<li class="p1">Recommended products can be configured in Klaviyo based on your product and customer data.</li>
<li class="p1">You can pull in your site header and footer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Overall, this gives you more options to customize your email.</p>
<p class="p1">All email platform providers like Klaviyo will also offer an analytics dashboard so you can measure success and optimize your campaigns. They also offer additional services beyond recovery emails.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is what Jennifer Joyce, the Vice President of Marketing at <a href="https://www.kurgo.com/">Kurgo</a> had to say about her company’s experience with Klaviyo:</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We like Klaviyo because it provides much more advanced technology at a small business price versus other email service providers.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“We are using Klaviyo to power all of our triggered and batch email campaigns to consumers and wholesale accounts. We use it for some of our transactional consumer emails and to collect email addresses through pop-ups, downloadable content, and campaign landing pages. We like Klaviyo because it provides much more advanced technology at a small business price versus other email service providers.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>It is seamlessly integrated with BigCommerce and has powerful segmentation and list creation capabilities. In addition, it’s triggered email technology is easy to use and enables us to act like a big brand when we are a smaller company.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">Derek Teschner, Co-Owner of <a href="https://www.herbaffair.com/">Herb Affair</a>, has had a similar experience with Klaviyo:</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Since using Klaviyo, our revenue from email is at about 20%, up from 8%!</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Klaviyo is working out fantastically. Before we started with them, our revenue from email was at about 8%. Keep in mind, we had no quality flows and were mainly sending blast emails.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Since we have been with them, our revenue from email is at about 20%. Being able to segment our customers and send the right emails to the right customer is incredible. We still have plenty of flows to set up. Our goal is to get to 30-40% revenue from email.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Other Options</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Ultimately, which abandoned cart provider you choose if up to you. Here are a few others options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/mailchimp/">MailChimp</a></li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/conversio/">Conversio </a></li>

</ul>

<h2 class="p4">Your Abandoned Cart Email Campaign Framework</h2>
<p class="p1">When a shopper abandons a cart, you’re going to send an email — or two or three. But how many emails can you send, and how many different versions of those emails do you have to choose from? What triggers an email?</p>
<p class="p1">If all you can do is send a single reminder email, do it. It’s almost certainly better than sending nothing at all. This is true even if it’s a single generic plain-text message with a link.</p>
<p class="p1">At Klaviyo, we frequently see strong results from the first email in an abandoned cart series, so the one email you send is likely to perform just like the first email of a series.</p>
<p class="p1">That said, sending a series of emails is usually more effective overall than sending just one. If you’re going to send a series, and the same version is going to go out to all shoppers with abandoned carts, here’s the one you’ll want to get started with.</p>
<p class="p1">It was <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/email-automation-basics">first explained to me</a> by Chad Vanags, formerly of Ecommerce Influence and Klaviyo, and it’s a simple yet powerful framework.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a logical 3-part progression:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Reminder</li>
<li class="p1">Discount with deadline</li>
<li class="p1">Deadline reminder</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p5">Abandoned cart email #1: The cart reminder</h3>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-first-email.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20555" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-first-email.png" alt="abandoned-cart-first-email" width="568" height="662" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-first-email.png 568w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/abandoned-cart-first-email-300x350.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of the first email in the abandoned cart nurture stream.</em></p>
<p class="p1">First, just let the shopper know that their items are still in the cart. In many cases, that’s all it takes to jog their memory of how much they wanted to make the purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Maybe the shopper hesitated because of a lack of information or <a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/fashion-industry-customer-reviews-data/">concern about fit</a>. Maybe they got confused about shipping costs. If you have the bandwidth, offer assistance in the email. Include a friendly invitation to reach out with questions, along with contact information.</p>
<p class="p1">Should you include a picture of the item or items in the cart in the email? Maybe.</p>
<p class="p1">Truth is, there’s more than one right answer to that. A plain-text email has a personal, low-key feeling and in some cases may be most effective.</p>
<p class="p1">But if showing the product is going to draw the shopper back in, which is true in many cases, then that makes the most sense. You’ll need to consider which approach is right for your brand and what you’re selling.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s smart here to A/B test your options and go with the version that has the highest performance.</p>
<p class="p1">Don’t immediately offer discounts at this stage. You can’t be sure why someone abandoned cart, and you don’t want to offer a discount is it isn’t needed to close the deal (these are your margins after all!).</p>
<p class="p1">Many online shoppers now know that abandoned cart emails will contain discounts, and wait to purchase once they get that. If that’s the case, making them wait a bit longer won’t alter their course.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Abandoned cart email #2: The discount with deadline</h3>
<p class="p1">The first email should have brought in the majority of people who are going to buy based on this sequence. So now you want to amp it up, as the holdouts may require more of an enticement.</p>
<p class="p1">A note of caution: sending a discount as part of an abandoned cart email sequence is always a little risky. Specifically, you run the risk of “training” your customers to leave items in their cart&#8230;and wait for an email with a discount.</p>
<p class="p1">How often does this actually happen? The best way to answer this is to monitor it for your store and see what patterns actually emerge.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, when you’re offering a discount, it’s very helpful to include a corresponding deadline. If it seems like the discount will last forever, there’s no urgency to the message.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, a deadline gives you a reason to send a helpful third and final email.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How to Use Psychology to 2x Sales</h3></p>
<p class="p1">There’s a science to humans as much as there is an art. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/retail-psychology-conversion-rate/">Here is how our brains work when faced with psychological triggers (and how you can use the info to increase sales)</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p5">Email #3: The deadline reminder</h3>
<p class="p1">As the deadline draws close — but before it expires — you’ll want to let the shopper know it’s coming up.</p>
<p class="p1">If someone is truly ambivalent about completing a purchase, a modest discount probably won’t draw them back in.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re not trying to reach those customers here, though. You’re aiming for the absent-minded folks and the procrastinators who love getting something done in the nick of time.</p>
<p class="p1">You are also aiming to help solve for that 61% of abandoned cart customers who leave because of final price. Offering a discount can pull them back in and alleviate those concerns. In this case, you may even want to offer free shipping instead of a discount.</p>
<p class="p1">If your email setup limits to you to a single-series approach, where every customer with an abandoned cart gets the same email sequence, good news: you’re done! You can stop reading here.</p>
<p class="p1">But if you’re on a platform that lets you create multiple versions of abandoned cart emails based on user behavior — or you just want some more ideas for fine-tuning your single series — keep reading.</p>
<p class="p1">Things are about to get more complicated (and more interesting!).</p>
<h2 class="p4">How to Customize Your Abandoned Cart Emails</h2>
<p class="p1">Still with me? Good, because this is where we roll up our sleeves and get into segmentation.</p>
<p class="p1">If you can create multiple versions of your abandoned cart email series, there are several different variables you’ll want to consider.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s walk through each one (shared here with thanks to my colleague Marissa Petteruti, who originally immortalized them in an <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/4-ways-to-segment-your-abandoned-cart-emails-infographic">infographic</a>).</p>
<h3 class="p5">Customization question #1: Who’s shopping?</h3>
<p class="p1">Remember the risks we looked at earlier about “training” customers to expect a discount? Turns out there’s a handy way around that.</p>
<p class="p1">Set up separate abandoned cart series for first-time customers and returning customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Even better, don’t just offer the first-time customers a discount. Let them know why they’re getting it.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s fine to say, “As a first-time customer, you’re getting a special discount.” That way, they won’t expect a discount on future purchases. Instead, they&#8217;ll have realistic expectations about the cart abandonment process in the future.</p>
<p class="p1">However, that doesn’t mean that your abandoned cart emails for returning customers need to be boring. Since they’ve bought from you before, you can utilize that information to cross-sell or upsell. You can set that up on your own or with a built-in recommendation engine if your email platform has one.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of an upsell inclusion. Also see their use of urgency –– “Hurry, there items won’t be saved forever.”</em></p>
<h3 class="p5">Customization question #2: What’s in the cart?</h3>
<p class="p1">Think about the products you sell.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Are a few of them unusually tricky to understand?</li>
<li class="p1">Are there reasons why people might get them all the way to the cart and then pause?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Set up your abandoned cart emails so that if those particular products show up in an abandoned cart, the customer will get a special version of the series. In it, you can invite the customer to contact support or check out answers to frequently asked questions.</p>
<p class="p1">Do you have a category of products that are simply much-loved? Consider including testimonials or review excerpts for those products in your abandoned-cart emails. The value here comes from the specificity and the relevance.</p>
<p class="p1">Besides considering the contents of the cart, you can also customize your messaging based on the number of items in the cart. For instance, you may find that shoppers who add an unusually high number of items are putting them there so they can choose between them later.</p>
<p class="p1">In these cases, they may not need to contact support as they would for a complicated product. Instead, they may need help narrowing down the items in their cart and you can provide messaging that helps them. For instance, you can emphasize your store’s easy returns to reduce the risk of making the wrong decision.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Customization question #3: How much is the cart worth?</h3>
<p class="p1">For especially high-value carts, you may want to offer a special discount, one that only shows up when the value reaches a certain threshold. You may also want to offer free shipping to inspire the shopper to complete the purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Another factor to consider here: the timing of the emails.</p>
<p class="p1">For the purchase of a high-value item, a shopper may need more time to decide or to get buy-in from other parties. Consider spacing the emails out further if you’d like to give them more time to do so.</p>
<h2 class="p4">How to Optimize Your Abandoned Cart Emails</h2>
<p class="p1">Even after you’ve meticulously built out several different email series to fit different situations, there’s more you can do to optimize the revenue your abandoned cart emails bring in. This is where standard email marketing best practices come into play.</p>
<p class="p1">A/B testing is a great way to optimize your abandoned cart emails, and subject lines are an excellent place to start. After all, if recipients aren’t opening the emails at all, they’re unlikely to have much effect beyond serving as a fleeting reminder.</p>
<p class="p1">You can also A/B test discount size. If a 10% discount would be just as effective as the 20% one you’re offering now, you’d want to know that, right?</p>
<p class="p1">To evaluate the effectiveness, look at standard email metrics like open rate and click-through-rate — and, of course, email-to-purchase conversion.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, you can try varying the timing of the emails.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Are you rushing things with the timing of your first email?</li>
<li class="p1">Spacing your emails too far apart?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The best way to know is to test and find out.</p>
<p class="p1">And then there’s a whole other area you can experiment with, and it doesn’t involve sending emails at all.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>It’s <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/feature-launch-integration-for-facebooks-custom-audiences">retargeting</a> with Facebook Custom Audiences.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">For example, let’s say your store offers free shipping on purchases over $99. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-advertising-guide/">You can create Facebook ads</a> emphasizing this policy. Then arrange for the ads to be shown to customers who have abandoned carts with over $99 of items in them.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, you’ll want to be sure to set up conditions that automatically drop them from the segment if they go back and complete their purchase, so they don’t continue seeing the ads after they’ve bought.</p>
<p class="p1">That way, you’re paying to advertise in front of likely buyers, people who’ve already been to your store and put items in their cart — and not people who have just bought. It’s a dynamic way to reach the customers you have who may not be opening or responding to emails, but are active on Facebook.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">Take the time to invest in your abandoned cart emails and your entire abandoned cart experience.</p>
<p class="p1">See abandoned carts as an extension of your customer service; a tool to improve customer satisfaction and help your shoppers complete the transaction they set out to make.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re likely to see significant results — in the form of revenue from previously abandoned carts, and ultimately <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies/">customer retention</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><em>I built a website, promoted it on Facebook and am getting a lot of visitors, but no one is buying.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Yea, that happened to me, too. When I first launched my business on BigCommerce, I had the site up and running rather easily. It looked the way I wanted it to. It worked the way I wanted it to. All I had to do, I thought, was get traffic there and presto: I’d have revenue coming in.</p>
<p class="p1">That isn’t how it happened at all.</p>
<p class="p1">When real visitors landed on my site –– pushed there by <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-advertising-guide/">real advertising dollars I had spent on Facebook</a> –– none of them were turning into real revenue. That’s when I realized I had more work to do. Building a profitable business isn’t just about setting it up well, it looking nice and then driving traffic to it. Instead, those are just the very first steps.</p>
<p class="p1">There are nuances to earning that sale –– what we will call “conversion” from here on out –– that are crucial for all business owners to know. And conversion doesn’t just happen: you need to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-online-store-increase-conversion-rates/">optimize for it.</a></p>
<p class="p1">This applies whether you are just starting up and running the whole show yourself, or if you are an ecommerce manager or marketing director who has signed up to hit massive goals and KPIs for the year.</p>
<p class="p1">First, let’s begin by defining a conversion –– which often has a different definition business to business.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>RSVP for the Ecommerce Growth Summit</h3></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">What is a conversion?</h2>
<p class="p1">When you are looking to increase your conversion rate, you need to know your end goal. Determine what a “conversion” means to your business.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Do you need more ecommerce sales?</li>
<li class="p1">Need to grow your email list?</li>
<li class="p1">Get more visibility for your brand?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">This guide covers how to increase ecommerce conversion rates on your site. Each of the bullets above are worth a guide all their own (the links of which above will get you on the right track).</p>
<p class="p1">“Conversion” is such a broad topic because it can be impacted by every aspect of the user experience on your site. Conversion rate optimization is the process of improving the shopping experience to drive a specific KPI — usually, sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Conversion rate optimization (CRO) can be conducted on landing pages, category pages, or any other customer touchpoint.</p>
<h2 class="p3">What is a good ecommerce conversion rate?</h2>
<p class="p1">Average ecommerce conversion rates are 1% &#8211; 2%. Even if you are doing everything right, you can still expect to win the sale around 2% of the time.</p>
<p class="p1">The following 28 steps are what helped me to reach 2% conversion on my own site. The outcome of these steps is measured by conversion rate, but in reality they all made a small, incremental improvement to the overall shopping experience.</p>
<p class="p1">A 2%+ conversion rate should be the baseline goal for your online store. Once you hit that and are doing all 28 of the below effectively, then you can move onto more advanced conversion rate tactics.</p>
<h2 class="p3">How do you calculate conversion rate for an ecommerce website?</h2>
<p class="p1">A quick example: If your online store is getting 5,000 visitors and 50 conversions for a set period, that means your store’s conversion rate is 1%. Simple as that! Divide conversion into visitors and you have conversion rate.</p>
<p class="p1">Most analytics tools provide conversion rate in any segmentation of the data, which we’ll get into in the sections below.</p>
<p class="p1">Before we go through what to do to increase conversions, we need to know exactly what your current visitors are doing, where they are getting stuck and how they interact with your website.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course when experts talk about increasing conversions you will hear a common theme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><em>Test, test, test.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">I am all for testing. However, it is important to know what are your current conversion issues are and understand the basics before you can know what you should test.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Step 1: Understand Your Current Conversion Issues</h2>
<p class="p1">There are some invaluable and very useful tools to help analyze your current conversion rate issues. The following five are my personal favorite conversion analysis tools.</p>
<h3 class="p4"><a href="http://www.inspectlet.com/">Inspectlet</a></h3>
<p class="p1">This is an amazing tool that will let you record every move your visitors make on your website. It will show you the users IP Address, location started page, where they came from and how long they stayed.</p>
<p class="p1">Sign up for an account and put a script tag on your site to start the session recording process. There is a free version that allows you 100 recorded sessions per month if you just want to get a feel for what your users are doing. Just add a script tag to your website and then login to your Inspectlet account. Click on a session to see the recording of each user’s interactivity on your website.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inspectlet-dashboard-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20522" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inspectlet-dashboard-1.png" alt="inspectlet-dashboard (1)" width="640" height="311" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inspectlet-dashboard-1.png 2652w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inspectlet-dashboard-1-300x146.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inspectlet-dashboard-1-750x365.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4"><a href="http://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a></h3>
<p class="p1">Mixpanel allows you to view your website visitors’ actions by placing event catching tags on various elements of your ecommerce website. This will not record like Inspectlet does, but it will give you a very detailed snapshot of what is happening based on where users click, how many times, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">This will help you determine how useful certain form fields are or how important certain sections of your website are to users. You can also setup A/B testing to determine which layouts and fields convert better. This mixpanel account shows a website I worked on and tracked various button clicks. This showed me what users were clicking on most which helped me tweak the form and content — a necessity for effective conversion rate optimization.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mixpanel-pic-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20521" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mixpanel-pic-1.png" alt="mixpanel-pic (1)" width="640" height="579" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mixpanel-pic-1.png 1497w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mixpanel-pic-1-300x271.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mixpanel-pic-1-750x678.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4"><a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/">CrazyEgg</a></h3>
<p class="p1">CrazyEgg is an eye tracking tool that lets you see where users are scrolling and interacting based on heatmaps, scrollmaps and overlay tools.</p>
<p class="p1">The confetti type view in crazyegg will show you everywhere users have clicked on your page and the colors signify greater or fewer clicks. Heatmap analysis helps you understand what users do once they get to your site, oftentimes unveiling opportunities to make certain aspects of a page easier to navigate.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/crazyegg-pic-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20523" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/crazyegg-pic-1.png" alt="crazyegg-pic (1)" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/crazyegg-pic-1.png 735w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/crazyegg-pic-1-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4"><a href="http://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> and Webmaster Tools</h3>
<p class="p1">For most websites, I suggest setting up Google Analytics or something equivalent. This gives you a great view into your website visitors including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">How visitors found your website: This could be from keyword searches in google, referral websites or direct visits.</li>
<li class="p1">How long visitors stay on your website</li>
<li class="p1">Where the visitors are from</li>
<li class="p1">If the visitors are returning or new</li>
<li class="p1">What browser, operating system and if the visitor used a mobile device or desktop/laptop</li>
<li class="p1">How many visitors converted (based on goals setup) and the interaction that lead to the conversion</li>
<li class="p1">Link to your Google Adwords campaign to track paid traffic as well</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Set Up Google Analytics with BigCommerce</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Setting-Up-Google-Analytics">Your step-by-step guide to getting Google Analytics set up for your BigCommerce ecommerce store. </a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">Google Search Console will gives you a peek at what keywords users are typing to find your website (if they click on your website or not). It also shows you various errors that may affect your website rankings such as slow loading pages, broken links, etc.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Verify Your Site with Google</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Be sure to <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Verifying-Your-Site-with-Google">verify your site with Google</a> to enable Google Search Console tools.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4"><a href="http://bigcommerce.evyy.net/c/362882/185949/2941">BigCommerce</a> Analytics</h3>
<p class="p1">If you have your store running on BigCommerce, the platform has an Analytics section in the administration panel that shows all abandoned carts including what products were in the cart at the time of abandonment.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20496" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1" width="640" height="392" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1.png 1127w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1-300x184.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1-750x460.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20497" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report" width="640" height="361" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report.png 1135w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-300x169.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-750x423.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">There are also analytics on In-Store Searches that will show you what customers are typing into the built-in BigCommerce search tool. This underutilized conversion optimization tactic helps you bridge the gap between what your customers are looking for and your on-site language and content.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20498" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1" width="640" height="401" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1.png 1148w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1-300x188.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1-750x470.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Look at keywords your potential customers are searching for that *are not* showing up. This can help you determine what you need to add into the store, for example.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20499" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search.png 1160w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-300x178.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-750x445.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce Analytics has multiple other Analytics dashboard, but they are most useful when you have customers. The two above will help you diagnose conversion problems without customers.</p>
<p class="p1">There are a few other great tools out there, but this should be more than enough to get visitor interaction information to figure out where your website is lacking or excelling in regards to conversion rates.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Step Two: Boost Your Conversion Rate</h2>
<h3 class="p4">1. Use high quality product images</h3>
<p class="p1">Think about what you want to see when you are shopping. When you are shopping online you can’t touch the product or put it on. The best thing you can do is to show as detailed an image as possible so that the customer knows exactly what they are getting. I suggest using as high quality images as possible depending on how close you want customers to zoom into the image.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How to Master Product Photography on a Tight Budget</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-rock-product-photography-on-a-budget/">Here’s how to create great product photography with very little money. </a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">2. Offer Free Shipping</h3>
<p class="p1">I am not 100% sure why this is such a big deal, but it is. Blame it on Amazon –– everyone does. But facts are facts and everyone likes to think they are getting a deal. Offering free shipping makes customers feel like they are getting some sort of deal even if they aren’t.</p>
<p class="p1">Think you can’t offer free shipping? Keep in mind that this is often a psychological game. Increase your product prices to cover shipping cost if that’s what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Is Free Shipping Really Sustainable?</h3></p>
<p class="p1">The experts over at ShipperHQ say, “Absolutely.” <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/#cmtoc_anchor_id_3">Here’s how to do it.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">3. Use Coupon Codes</h3>
<p class="p1">Create coupon codes that customers can use at checkout to get a specific amount off or a percentage of the purchase.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20500" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1" width="640" height="368" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1.png 1153w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1-798x457.png 798w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1-300x173.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1-750x431.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20501" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-coupons" width="640" height="346" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons.png 1151w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-300x162.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-750x406.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4">4. Adjust Product Prices</h3>
<p class="p1">If you are selling brand name items that a lot of other stores offer, unfortunately you might have to price your products at or below the average price in order to compete. Be sure to adjust your prices frequently to see what resonates. Also know that the quality of your marketing and imagery will heavily influence the price someone is willing to pay.</p>
<p class="p1">Fitness brands like Lululemon and Outdoor Voices have done this extremely well. Just check out the article in the <a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/2016/11/outdoor-voices-makes-the-best-sweatpants-for-women.html">New Yorker praising Outdoor Voices’ products</a>. They have clearly targeted the right audience. Market your brand to the right audience, with the right messaging and the right imagery, and the revenue will come in.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>We De-mystified Product Pricing</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/value-based-ecommerce-pricing-strategy/">Why value-based pricing works best</a> (both for your customer and your bottom line).</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">5. Tweak your ecommerce checkout process</h3>
<p class="p1">If your store checkout process is too long, complicated or unconventional, you may lose a lot of customers right as they are ready to buy. This crucial step  in the funnel is where a lot of your split testing, A/B tests and site tweaks should take place.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, there are industry standards for most hosted ecommerce platforms such as BigCommerce, but you may still need to tweak the process based on your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, BigCommerce offers an optimized checkout out-of-the-box that is technically a single page (with a few drop downs and a persistent view of the product(s) being bought).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20502" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout-300x200.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout-750x501.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Out-of-the-box optimized checkout example.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Some brands like to take this even further and build off that optimized checkout to create a true one-page checkout where you can see the entire checkout process when you land on the page. Multiple BigCommerce partners can help you skin this as needed.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20503" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<h3 class="p4">6. Use cart abandonment software</h3>
<p class="p1">If you are getting a lot of abandoned carts –– i.e. Someone lands on your site, puts an item in the cart and then leaves –– then <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/cart-abandonment-software/">abandoned cart software</a> can greatly increase your conversion rates.</p>
<p class="p1">This software works with users that have added items to their shopping cart, entered their email and details and then left your store. Some ecommerce platforms offer this software free as part of the store functionality. Thankfully, BigCommerce is one of those.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s an example of the first email from a BigCommerce customer after an abandoned cart.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20524" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1" width="640" height="397" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1.png 971w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1-750x466.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Their software allows you to create follow-up emails that will send the user an email with their cart contents as well as allow you to give them a coupon code to get a discount as an incentive to complete their order. Decreasing abandonment rate should be a high priority for online store owners, since this cohort of users have demonstrated interest — and abandonment is often between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonment_rate">60 and 80%</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20505" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20504" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email.png 1134w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-300x180.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The success of this software is different for every store, but there is no doubt that it helps pretty much 100% of ecommerce stores that use it. Some stores see as much as a 30% increase in their website conversion rates. Acting on cart abandonment by itself can take you from low to average conversion rate.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">7. Use live chat software</h3>
<p class="p1">I have had mixed results with this. I believe this can increase conversions, but I would suggest that if you choose to use live chat software that you are truly available during business hours to immediately respond to customers that request a chat.</p>
<p class="p1">Do not let the software go into the mode that says you are currently unavailable and that they can leave a message. That sends a bad signal. It would be better to not implement at all if you can’t be there when they want to chat.</p>
<p class="p1">What this does though is build a direct communication line from your potential customer to you. Creating a real human connection will help build trust for this purchase as well as lifetime loyalty in the future.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">8. Let customers know your ecommerce store is safe</h3>
<p class="p1">This is subtle, but a really big deal. You need to build a certain level of trust in a short amount of time for customers to be willing to enter their credit card information on your website.</p>
<p class="p1">Finding ways to enhance your on-site trust and credibility should be the basis for many of your conversion rate optimization activities.</p>
<p class="p1">Customers want to know that they are dealing with a legitimate store that has industry standard security measures in place that ensures them their credit card information will be protected. Here are a few things that help:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Install SSL at checkout (out-of-the-box on most ecommerce platforms) and site wide if possible.</li>
<li class="p1">Show small images of credit cards, PayPal and other payment options as a visual signal that you use customer-trust payment options.</li>
<li class="p1">Display some sort of McAfee, GeoTrust or other security badges, and make sure that you actually have an active account with them. Don’t just add an image if you aren’t truly secure.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>SSL How You Need It</h3></p>
<p class="p1">In addition to the shared SSL certificate used by all BigCommerce stores, BigCommerce also offers <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/BigCommerce-SSL-Options">dedicated SSL certificates verified by GeoTrust</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">9. Setup structure so visitors can easily find products</h3>
<p class="p1">Structure your product categories in a logical manner, but make sure you use as few levels as possible to allow a user to reach a product as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-categories.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20506" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-categories.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-categories" width="640" height="444" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-categories.png 1066w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-categories-300x208.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-categories-750x521.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I simplified mine like the above. Oftentimes, it is also necessary to allow customers to Shop by Color or other various fields.</p>
<p class="p1">Setup a rotating banner to showcase top products. Here is an example from <a href="https://www.trustthebum.com/">Trust the Bum</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-slider-3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20507" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-slider-3.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-slider-3" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-slider-3.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-slider-3-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-slider-3-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Rotating image 3</em></p>
<p class="p1">Also, implement a website search to allow customers to find products easily. The faster a visitor can find a product, the more likely they are to buy from you.</p>
<h3 class="p4">10. Make your checkout form easy to understand</h3>
<p class="p1">Make sure that everything on your checkout form is completely understood, such as CVV and input formats. In fact, if you can, I would have the fields limit only what can be typed into certain fields to make it easier for users.</p>
<p class="p1">So, when a user types a credit card number, format it for them as they go along to make it easier to read and harder to mess up.</p>
<p class="p1">In a date field, don’t let the user type, but have a date picker or dropdown.</p>
<p class="p1">The user is already reluctant to enter their personal credit/debit card info already. Don’t give them any reason to feel uncomfortable or make it hard for them to check out.</p>
<p class="p1">Digital wallets are help tremendously with this. Digital wallets are payment processors like PayPal Express, Amazon Pay, Apple Pay, and others. These systems allow users to sign in with their account information and then pre-populates everything for them. It is faster for them, and more secure for everyone.</p>

<h3 class="p4">11. Always show shopping cart contents</h3>
<p class="p1">Show a shopping cart icon with a link to get to it after the user has entered an item into the cart. If they can’t find the cart they can’t checkout.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, be sure to show customers what they are actually buying as they checkout. As mentioned earlier, BigCommerce’s optimized checkout does this out of the box.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20510" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of an out-of-the-box checkout for BigCommerce customers.</em></p>
<h3 class="p4">12. Let customers checkout as guests</h3>
<p class="p1">Allow users to checkout without signing up for an account. You will have their name and email address when they buy anyway. Forcing the user to register is just giving them another reason to leave your store.</p>
<p class="p1">See image above to see how that works.</p>
<h3 class="p4">13. Give detailed product descriptions</h3>
<p class="p1">Make sure you describe the product in great detail so the customer knows exactly what they are getting. Remember, they can’t touch the product and they are not in a store where they can ask questions. This will also prevent returns.</p>

<p class="p1">Even better: add a product video or demonstration.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>All of <a href="https://sierradesigns.com/clip-flashlight-2/">Sierra Designs</a>’ products have videos featured on their product page showing the product off and in use.</em></p>
<p class="p1">All of this helps to build your SEO ranking as well –– so it is beneficial for your for multiple reasons.</p>
<h3 class="p4">14. Allow customers to review products</h3>
<p class="p1">Why do so many people buy from Amazon? Because of the reviews.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember the last time you went to buy a product online. Did you search for reviews before buying? I bet you did.</p>
<p class="p1">You could even offer customers a coupon code or other type of incentive next time they purchase as a reward for providing a review. Also, ask the customer to voice any complaints to you so you have the opportunity to address any issues as this will help you receive more positive reviews.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Generate 62% More Revenue</h3></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">15. Make your “Add to Cart” and “Checkout” buttons prevalent</h3>
<p class="p1">Sometimes a user is thinking of buying and can be further prompted to do so by an actionable button that says exactly what to do and that stands out from all the other surrounding text and images.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Jeremy Hagon, Marketing Manager, Andreas Carter Sports</div></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">16. Provide product testimonials if applicable</h3>
<p class="p1">Ever heard the statement ‘Facts Tell, but Stories Sell’? Well, it’s true. Testimonials are way more powerful than just a list of features.</p>
<p class="p1">Prove your product works by using real testimonials. Start by offering your product for review to prominent review websites (that give honest reviews) and use this as a starting point for your testimonials.</p>
<p class="p1">Hint –– press reviews counts!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-press.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20518" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-press.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-press" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-press.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-press-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-press-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4">17. Have a great product return policy</h3>
<p class="p1">Most customers (over 50%) will read the return policy before buying. Don’t over-promise here, but definitely make it as painless and as easy as possible for customers to return products (within reason). This may not sound like conversion optimization, but is another example of basic business practices acting as CRO.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">18. Optimize for mobile devices</h3>
<p class="p1">Your ecommerce store needs to work on mobile devices. Hosted stores such as BigCommerce support this out of the box, but you may need to tweak how it looks and works on a mobile device for your own specific business needs.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Mobile Responsive Out-of-the-Box</h3></p>

<h3 class="p4">19. Have a phone number</h3>
<p class="p1">You can buy a toll-free phone number for fairly cheap using services such as tollfreeforwarding.com (which is where I bought my number for FabFutons.com).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20512" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I would also suggest having a professional record the phone menu or voicemail for you if you are a smaller store so that you can project a more professional image and make customers feel more comfortable buying from you.</p>
<p class="p1">You can find professional voice over freelancers on Fiverr.com and UpWork.com. I have personally used and recommend Fiverr.com.</p>
<h3 class="p4">20. Provide valuable content</h3>
<p class="p1">Write useful and valuable content to supplement your products. The more value and information you can provide your customer, the more likely they are to buy from you (as opposed to a competitor that does not offer as much).</p>
<p class="p1">This includes writing valuable content on your product pages, but also using blog content to educate, inform and engage your target audience. This will also help to increase organic SEO traffic.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, not traditional conversion rate optimization, but still moves the needle.</p>

<h3 class="p4">21. Try and catch customers before they leave</h3>
<p class="p1">Once a customer leaves, they are most likely going to buy from somewhere else.</p>
<p class="p1">While I hate pop ups as much as the next guy, but the last chance you have to catch a potential customer is the moment they are trying to exit your website.</p>
<p class="p1">You can use software such as MaxTraffic, OptiMonk, Sleeknote, Sumome or OptinMonster. Your goal here is to collect an email and drive your subscription base. Your subscription base (whether they are customers or not) are people you do not have to spend money on to advertise or market to –– because you can send them an email, instead. You want that list to be as large and engaged (i.e. actively opening the emails) as possible.</p>

<h3 class="p4">22. Grab visitors’ attention quickly</h3>
<p class="p1">If you can’t grab the visitor’s attention in the first 3 seconds, then you probably have lost them.</p>
<p class="p1">Images will be the first thing someone sees and uses to judge a website subconsciously. Make sure if you are going to use large images on the homepage to choose carefully and try to catch the visitors attention in a positive way.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">23. Use “Calls to Action” sparingly</h3>
<p class="p1">Don’t overwhelm a visitor with too many options and CTAs on one screen. I suggest having an ‘Add to Wishlist’, ‘Share Icons’, ‘Add to Cart’, ‘Learn More’, etc all in the same area on the same page.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-social.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20517" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-social.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-social" width="640" height="340" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-social.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-social-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Drive the user to the call-to-action that you want them to perform on that page. If they are on a product page, then use ‘Add to Cart’. If they are on the Cart page use: ‘Proceed to Checkout’.</p>

<p class="p1">See how <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-ctas/">dozens of other stores use CTAs</a> to earn more revenue with each visit.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">24. Use a tripwire offer</h3>
<p class="p1">A tripwire is a low-cost almost undeniable deal to get a visitor to purchase from you.</p>
<p class="p1">This does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">First, it allows you to “get the money flowing” as perfected by American Pickers. This builds trust.</li>
<li class="p1">The second thing is does is allow you to offer a higher priced / upsell to the current customer. You can now approach them as a customer and treat them as such. Give them special treatment and offer them something they cannot get as a normal visitor. This is just a longer process of building trust. You can also use this as a way to grow your ecommerce email list, which allows you to sell to the list at any time even if you don’t try and sell them something immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">The Badass Beard Care team was done this perfectly. They offer a free sample of the product in an ad on Facebook. The customer only pays for shipping. This gets the product in the customer’s hand, and gets that customer’s information to the marketing gurus at Badass Beard Care.</p>

<h3 class="p4">25. Do small incremental changes</h3>
<p class="p1">When tweaking your website, be sure to do small changes so you can test and measure what changes helped or hurt your conversion rates.</p>
<h3 class="p4">26. Dare to be different</h3>
<p class="p1">Explain why a visitor should buy from you. What makes you different from all the others selling the same products. What is your Unique Value Proposition. Why would I buy from you?</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>The Complete Guide to Writing Copy That Sells</h3></p>

<h3 class="p4">27. Spell check</h3>
<p class="p1">Yes, you read that right. Make sure you spell everything correctly. Not doing this may hurt your sales as people will lose confidence and trust in your company.</p>
<h3 class="p4">28. Measure your ecommerce conversion rate optimization success</h3>
<p class="p1">There are a couple of ways to make sure your tweaks and changes are working. The obvious one is to verify that your conversion rates are increasing.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20516" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats" width="640" height="351" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats.png 1130w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats-300x164.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats-750x411.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>BigCommerce tracks your store&#8217;s conversion rates day-over-day, week-over-week, month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and in any customizable way you want to see it. You can view it easily on your dashboard, or on the Analytics Dashboard.</em></p>
<p class="p1">There is more than just increasing conversions, though, as you want to make sure your value per customer or bottom line is increasing as well.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s more important to know what you are going to do with the traffic you receive than to just try and always get more traffic. Make the most of what you already have and then push for more traffic.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Step 3: What to Do With Your New Customers</h2>
<p class="p1">The conversion optimization game doesn’t end when you make a first sale. It doesn’t end when your make your 100th sale either. It’s great that you now have customers, but now is the time you go from that 2% conversion rate to something much higher.</p>
<p class="p1">Small tweaks can seriously boost your bottom line, and while your front-end conversion rate is now optimized for 2% conversion, and getting you customers, it’s time to optimize your back-end conversion rate. This means you’ll now want to focus on driving repeat purchases in a predictable way.</p>
<p class="p1">Why predictable? Because once you have a baseline average conversion rate for your site and a steady repeat purchase rate from already existing customers –– you can better determine how much to spend on advertising to win a customer over. This is because your ROAS (return on ad spend) lowers as repeat purchases increase.</p>
<p class="p1">Ecommerce expert <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanwbowman?lang=en">Bryan Bowman</a> calls this the “Value Ladder.”</p>
<p class="p1">At this year’s PROSPER Show in Las Vegas, he gave a fantastic presentation about how to build a value ladder, beginning with free educational content (i.e. your blog) and moving people up the awareness ladder to increased sales with your brand. Here is how he drew it out.</p>
<p class="p1">Literally, he hand drew it.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-value-ladder.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20530" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-value-ladder.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-value-ladder" width="640" height="368" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-value-ladder.png 651w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-value-ladder-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Here are the steps he described –– paraphrased here –– to build a value ladder.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The Free Stage</h3>
<p class="p1">Potential customers begin at an unaware stage. They don’t know they are looking for your product. You must educate them –– in a non-salesy way. If you are selling fishing lures, for instance, start with content about, “Seven Reason Why Your Last Fishing Trip Wasn’t Successful.” Maybe only one of those reasons is fishing lures.</p>
<p class="p1">At this stage, work to capture emails via pop ups as described below, or retarget visitors with ads to pull them back to the site. They are now aware they might have a fishing lure problem.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The $ Stage</h3>
<p class="p1">In this first conversion stage (if you are measuring conversions as a sale), a customer may only be comfortable enough with your brand to buy something small. Offer an inexpensive lure that can help solve their problem as a tester. This is similar to the Badass Beard Care “free product” offer mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="p1">At this point, you will have the customer’s email and can begin using an email nurture stream, rather than additional advertising dollars to continue them up the value ladder.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The $$ Stage</h3>
<p class="p1">Now, they have tried your lure and like it. Offer them a subscription service to multiple lures, or monthly lures. Or, offer them a bundle. Either way, you are moving them up the value ladder.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The $$$ Stage</h3>
<p class="p1">Often, each stage will require a new “awareness” problem. For instance, say you now want to sell someone a tackle box for all their new lures. First, you have to educate them on why their current tackle box isn’t fitting the bill.</p>
<p class="p1">In this way, the value ladder often starts over. The difference, however, is that you already have the customer’s business and email address. You don’t need to re-advertise to them. You just need to keep them engaged with your brand and content via email nurture streams –– and lead them down a new, higher cost funnel.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The $$$$+ Stages</h3>
<p class="p1">At this point, your ecommerce business is more mature and it may make sense to partner with other brands to offer fishing trips (for example) to your audience and move them even further up both the value and engagement ladder. This is where your big ticket item purchases will occur –– after someone has purchased with you and trusts your brand.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Other Metrics to Help Measure Conversion</h2>
<p class="p1">Beyond how well your store converts there are a few other metrics that matter when discussing conversion. That’s because they are indicative of engaged or disengaged user behavior. Moving these metric sin the right direction will generally help your overall conversion rate.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/4-tips-improve-ecommerce-bounce-rate-right-now-sellmore-video/">Bounce Rate</a></strong> is the percentage of people who leave after viewing a single page. A high bounce rate is not a good thing – for some reason (or reasons), people aren’t finding what they’re looking for on your store, so they are leaving immediately after landing on your site.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2525491?hl=en">Exit Rate</a></strong>, often confused with bounce rate, is the percentage of people who leave after viewing the page. Your exit rate lets you know the last page that users view before they move on. A very high exit rate on a specific page can be a red flag.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Click through rate</strong>: The number of people who click a link to your website from an ad or email. Optimization for AdWords or email marketing campaigns often focuses on getting more users to click through to your website and take an action — or even engage on social media.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can find these metrics in your Google Analytics account under “Behavior &gt; Overview”</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1006253?hl=en">Average Session Duration</a></strong> is an engagement metric that gives you a general idea of how long people are sticking around your site. A high bounce rate means a low average time on site — visitors aren’t sticking around long enough to do whatever it is you want them to do (convert).</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Average Page Depth</strong> (AKA Pages per Session in Google Analytics) is an engagement metric that tells you how many pages a potential shopper visited before leaving. This metric is simply total pageviews per session duration. Note that more page views can mean more engagement but also can mean a lack of clarity in your conversion funnel if no conversion is present.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can find these metrics in your Google Analytics account under “Audience &gt; Overview”.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">The value ladder isn’t perfect for everyone, but it does do a great job at explaining why it is important for you to think through what you will do with your customer once you get them in. Driving repeat business is extremely valuable, both in terms of revenue as well as brand engagement and interaction. It is how you actually build a brand –– not just a flash sale site.</p>
<p class="p1">But, before you can begin on the value ladder, it is important that you first make sure your website is converting at a baseline level of 1-2%. The 28 steps mention in here will help you to accomplish that and not waste precious advertising dollars.</p>

<p class="p1">All of those stats are net positive for online businesses in terms of earning a customer’s cash. But product reviews aren’t beneficial only for conversion. They can also drive traffic by increasing SEO and up-sell and cross-sell additional products to both existing and potential customer cohorts.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s what we know in those arenas:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Increasing review volume leads to higher conversion rates – even at high volume levels: <strong>50 or more reviews per product can mean a 4.6% increase in conversion rates.</strong></li>
<li class="p1">Fresh, product-specific review content drives search traffic and keyword rankings, specifically <strong>when a business earns 10 or more reviews –– resulting in 15-20% increase in search traffic.</strong></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>3- and 4-star reviews contain 2x as many product suggestions as others</strong> –– informing brands of products that work, and which do not.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bazaarvoice-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20455" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bazaarvoice-customer-testimonials.png" alt="bazaarvoice-customer-testimonials" width="640" height="364" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bazaarvoice-customer-testimonials.png 773w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bazaarvoice-customer-testimonials-300x171.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bazaarvoice-customer-testimonials-750x427.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://media2.bazaarvoice.com/documents/Bazaarvoice_Conversation_Index_Volume8.pdf">Bazaarvoice’s Conversion Index Volume 8</a> explains how an increasing volume of reviews affects first conversions, then SEO (and organic traffic), followed by product and business insights gathered from crowdsourcing.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Driving review volume is clearly important. After all, we live in the post-Amazon age. But the most striking data isn’t about traffic, product insights or even bottom of the funnel conversion. It’s about interaction, and how social proof (i.e. customer reviews) affect your conversion rates across the board –– in all industries and on all channels.</p>
<p class="p1">When a consumer interacts with your review, three things happen. They:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Are 58% more likely to convert</li>
<li class="p1">Generate 62% more revenue per site visitor</li>
<li class="p1">Buy 3% more per order (AOV)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Those numbers in hand, what if you could pre-plant positive reviews across the web to drive not only increased conversions, but increased AOV and return-on-ad-spend (ROAS)?</p>
<p class="p1">We already know Google and Amazon heavily merit positive customer reviews. They increase your search ranking on both platforms, and both companies strictly control the process in favor of the customer.</p>
<p class="p1">We also know that agencies like the Better Business Bureau affect consumer trust, with the BBB’s security seal coming in 3rd on the <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/perceived-security-of-payment-form">Baymard’s survey of consumer-rated trust in checkout seals</a>.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/customer-testimonials-BBB.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20454" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/customer-testimonials-BBB.jpg" alt="customer-testimonials-BBB" width="640" height="444" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/customer-testimonials-BBB.jpg 1536w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/customer-testimonials-BBB-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/customer-testimonials-BBB-750x520.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And, of course, take your own personal use case. Do you buy items with no reviews? Do you buy items with low-star reviews? Do you care?</p>
<p class="p1">I’d venture to guess those answers are, respectively: <strong>not often</strong>, <strong>rarely</strong> and <strong>yeah –– I do care</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">So then, the next logical step is to begin using the product reviews you are generating on your site more broadly in your advertising across the web. This concept is not new. <a href="http://blog.bazaarvoice.com/2008/01/23/using-reviews-in-advertising/">Best Buy began doing it in 2008</a>. Amazon takes it to a whole new level with their brick-and-mortar bookstores, using floorspace as advertising space for online customer reviews.</p>

<p class="p1">Here are how other brands are making this work for them –– and how you can begin incorporating your own product reviews and testimonials into your marketing and advertising strategy to lower your cost of acquisition and increase your ROAS. In general, we’ll be talking about how to take customer reviews and them strategically as customer testimonials.</p>

<h1 class="p2">Where to Use Customer Testimonials to Increase Acquisition</h1>
<h2 class="p3">Social Media</h2>
<p class="p1">There’s no better place to share customer testimonials than across your social channels.</p>
<p class="p1">Brands that share authentic user-generated content are constantly building more trust with their social audience. Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn are ideal opportunities to post customer testimonials alongside customer photos and profiles.</p>
<p class="p1">Check out how Fugoo intersperses review content and regular lifestyle images of customers using the speaker on their Facebook page.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fugoo-customer-testimonials-3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20450" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fugoo-customer-testimonials-3.png" alt="fugoo-customer-testimonials-3" width="495" height="480" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fugoo-customer-testimonials-3.png 495w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fugoo-customer-testimonials-3-300x291.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fugoo-customer-testimonials-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20448" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fugoo-customer-testimonials-1.png" alt="fugoo-customer-testimonials-1" width="491" height="457" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fugoo-customer-testimonials-1.png 491w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fugoo-customer-testimonials-1-300x279.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Or, take a note from Onzie, which shares quotes along with customer-submitted images in a very authentic, human way &#8211; the same way you or I would tell our own social networks about a brand we can’t get enough of.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead of sharing a 300-word review that speaks to all of the technical or design features of the product, this sparks just enough curiosity to entice new customers to visit the site to learn more.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/onzie-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20447" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/onzie-customer-testimonials.png" alt="onzie-customer-testimonials" width="640" height="410" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/onzie-customer-testimonials.png 834w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/onzie-customer-testimonials-300x192.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/onzie-customer-testimonials-750x480.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Even media reviews can be used, like Native Union did here.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/native-union-instagram-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20451" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/native-union-instagram-customer-testimonials.png" alt="native-union-instagram-customer-testimonials" width="640" height="408" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/native-union-instagram-customer-testimonials.png 837w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/native-union-instagram-customer-testimonials-300x191.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/native-union-instagram-customer-testimonials-750x478.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p1">Paid Ads</h2>
<p class="p2">The <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks">average AdWords click-through rate</a> across all industries peaks at 1.91% for search ads, and 0.35% for display ads. But, an AdWords ad that includes a customer review extension sees an increased <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/3236114?hl=en">click-through of up to 10%</a>.</p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/adwords-seller-ratings-example-600x143.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20462" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/adwords-seller-ratings-example-600x143.jpg" alt="adwords-seller-ratings-example-600x143" width="600" height="143" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/adwords-seller-ratings-example-600x143.jpg 600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/adwords-seller-ratings-example-600x143-300x72.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Those ratings show up in Ads automatically <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-seller-ratings-increase-minimum-reviews-257541">when a review threshold is met</a>. Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">30 unique reviews over the last 12 months</li>
<li class="p1">Reviews must average at least 3.5 stars or higher</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Tools to Drive Increased Reviews</h3></p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce offers plenty of one-click apps and integrations for brands looking to increase their review volume. Here are a few:</p>

<p class="p1">Social proof is an important component of any marketing campaign, and paid media is certainly no exception.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Search Engine Optimization</h2>
<p class="p1">Search engines are placing more weight than ever on customer testimonials for a number of reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Testimonials create fresh, ever-changing, and relevant content that proves to search engines customers are interacting with your brand.</li>
<li class="p1">Reviews are naturally filled with long-tail keywords that customers are actually searching for.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Customer review and user-generated content software <a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/reviews-seo/">Yotpo</a> performed their own research to see how testimonials could impact SEO rankings. They tested 30,000 ecommerce businesses of all sizes and industries to “<strong>see how SEO traffic increased when the only common denominator was adding reviews to their site.</strong>”</p>
<p class="p1">Over the course of nine months, they found that, on average, a site using customer reviews increases site traffic about 45%.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/untitled-graphic-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20468" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/untitled-graphic-1.png" alt="untitled-graphic-1" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/untitled-graphic-1.png 1200w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/untitled-graphic-1-300x200.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/untitled-graphic-1-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">A few tips to make sure the customer testimonials on your site are optimized for search:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Place testimonials in plain HTML instead of Java or Flash so they are readable by search engines.</li>
<li class="p1">Use schema markups or rich snippets to help search engines sort and make sense of testimonials, and share relevant information on search engine result pages.</li>
<li class="p1">Encourage longer testimonials by creating a number of fields or asking a series of questions for the customer to describe your product or service.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Consider StoreYourBoard. In August of 2016, the company optimized their on-site review system utilizing product reviews as well as FAQs. In September, their revenue for search traffic jumped from $1.5K to more than $30K. Today, search traffic drives hundreds of thousands in revenue, just behind AdWords and Direct.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/storeyourboard-customer-reviews.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20461" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/storeyourboard-customer-reviews.png" alt="storeyourboard-customer-reviews" width="640" height="845" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/storeyourboard-customer-reviews.png 1345w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/storeyourboard-customer-reviews-300x396.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/storeyourboard-customer-reviews-750x990.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">Homepage</h2>
<p class="p1">Engagement is a key factor for increased search ranking. It is also a key factor for any landing page (like your homepage) in moving consumers through from top of funnel to final sale. Customer testimonials can aid here in both SEO as well as merchandising to drive more traffic (thanks to on-site clicks) and move consumers through the funnel.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Homepage testimonial examples</h3>
<p class="p1">Let’s look at a few examples. First is NatoMounts, which uses customer testimonials at the end of their landing page-like Homepage, in the case a customer needs a final push to purchase.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/natomounts-customer-review.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20466" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/natomounts-customer-review.png" alt="natomounts-customer-review" width="640" height="2734" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/natomounts-customer-review.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/natomounts-customer-review-300x1282.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/natomounts-customer-review-750x3204.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/badass-beard-care-customer-reviews.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20465" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/badass-beard-care-customer-reviews.png" alt="badass-beard-care-customer-reviews" width="640" height="1728" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/badass-beard-care-customer-reviews.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/badass-beard-care-customer-reviews-300x810.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/badass-beard-care-customer-reviews-750x2025.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<h1 class="p3">Using Customer Testimonials to Increase Conversions</h1>
<h2 class="p4">Customer Testimonial Videos</h2>
<p class="p1">One of the best ways to utilize a testimonial from a happy customer is to create a video. Testimonial videos, when done right, provide a more human and authentic connection than the typical promotional videos.</p>
<p class="p1">You can use product review videos like NaturallyCurly does here:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9OC6qOaL7Y?list=PLqVnLZBt_dN-ax9uZPDBtsfTGjF4_iLPG" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">Or help to promote testimonial videos made but your customers,like Native Union does here:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dDh6TMF044" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">Even better, check out the ads for the exact product available underneath the video.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/native-union-youtube-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20446" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/native-union-youtube-customer-testimonials.png" alt="native-union-youtube-customer-testimonials" width="640" height="264" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/native-union-youtube-customer-testimonials.png 872w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/native-union-youtube-customer-testimonials-300x124.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/native-union-youtube-customer-testimonials-750x310.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p1">Testimonial Page</h2>
<p class="p2">Once you have a collection of happy customers, you’ll need to perfect the way you share their reviews on your website. And it doesn’t have to be complicated.</p>
<p class="p2">The Dairy Fairy compiles customer reviews onto a single page, this one for “Mama’s Reviews.” She’ll soon have similar pages for Blog reviews and Media reviews as well.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-dairy-fairy-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20456" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-dairy-fairy-customer-testimonials.png" alt="the-dairy-fairy-customer-testimonials" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-dairy-fairy-customer-testimonials.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-dairy-fairy-customer-testimonials-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-dairy-fairy-customer-testimonials-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Remember that press mentions are also great to highlight on a page similarly to customer reviews. See how Vivino does it below.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vivino-press-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20457" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vivino-press-customer-testimonials.png" alt="vivino-press-customer-testimonials" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vivino-press-customer-testimonials.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vivino-press-customer-testimonials-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vivino-press-customer-testimonials-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If you don’t want to reuse your customer reviews, here is a great example of how to combine social media posts onto an interactive page. You can gather these by encouraging customers to use a specific hashtag when they post to Instagram.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shabby-apple-community-page-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20458" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shabby-apple-community-page-customer-testimonials.png" alt="shabby-apple-community-page-customer-testimonials" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shabby-apple-community-page-customer-testimonials.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shabby-apple-community-page-customer-testimonials-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shabby-apple-community-page-customer-testimonials-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">Case studies are not the best use case for every ecommerce company. Technology companies use case studies often to prove value and earn customer testimonials. This works well for businesses selling solutions.</p>
<p class="p1">For instance, Bright Agrotech has a case studies page featuring the farmers (both new and legacy) using their system. The page is a great resources for their various customer groups to see how success their solution is.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bright-agrotech-case-studies.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20459" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bright-agrotech-case-studies.png" alt="bright-agrotech-case-studies" width="640" height="3434" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bright-agrotech-case-studies.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bright-agrotech-case-studies-300x1609.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bright-agrotech-case-studies-750x4024.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If you sell a solution, you can create case studies by hopping on calls with customers who have already expressed positive feedback. Ask if they’d be willing to tell their story. You can send them a survey via Google Surveys, or use a free service like Uber Conference to record and transcribe interviews.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few questions you’ll want to ask:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">What were the main challenges and pain points that lead you to look for a solution?</li>
<li class="p1">What lead you to our business, and how did we stand out against the competition?</li>
<li class="p1">What were your goals in the beginning of our engagement/project/purchase?</li>
<li class="p1">What benefits did you experience from using our product/service? Ask for quantitative data here.</li>
<li class="p1">What would you tell other customers suffering from the same challenges you were struggling with?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>BigCommerce Case Studies</h3></p>
<p class="p1">With 10 new case studies each month, the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/">BigCommerce Case Study page</a> is one to keep bookmarked.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">Highlight Target Customers</h2>
<p class="p1">“Like-me” audiences resonate more with customers. If your target audience is women with young children, use testimonials from women with young children (and include their ages –– not names! –– in the review, too).</p>
<p class="p1">See below how Georg Roth Los Angeles uses everyday Yelp reviews on Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yelp-georg-roth-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20452" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yelp-georg-roth-customer-testimonials.png" alt="yelp-georg-roth-customer-testimonials" width="495" height="600" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yelp-georg-roth-customer-testimonials.png 495w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yelp-georg-roth-customer-testimonials-300x364.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Third-party review sites like Yelp are <a href="http://media2.bazaarvoice.com/documents/Bazaarvoice_Conversation_Index_Volume8.pdf">81% more trustworthy</a> than brand-owned channels, according to consumers.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Influencer Marketing</h2>
<p class="p1">Plain and simple, influencer marketing works. <a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/8-new-stats-about-whether-influencer-marketing-campaigns-actually-work-174868/">According to AdWeek</a>, marketers say the most valuable aspect of an influencer marketing campaign is:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">87% –– creating authentic content about their brand</li>
<li class="p1">77% –– driving engagement around their brand</li>
<li class="p1">56% –– driving traffic to their websites or landing pages</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Find the influencers in your space and work to forge solid relationships with them. Or, if budget allows, pay them outright. Costs are estimated at $25,000 to $50,000 per campaign.</p>
<p class="p1">Either way, people trust people they like –– and influencers have a lot of power here. These campaigns work best is done on Facebook or Instagram, where 87% of marketers say the campaigns worked. Popular blogs also have influence, where 50% of marketers say the campaigns worked.</p>
<p class="p1">Marucci is hands down one of the best when it comes to influencer marketing. Professional baseball players sue their products regularly, and the brand takes advantage of that loyalty.</p>
<p class="p1">See here how they use influencer marketing on their homepage:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-influencer-marketing-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20460" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-influencer-marketing-customer-testimonials.png" alt="marucci-influencer-marketing-customer-testimonials" width="640" height="318" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-influencer-marketing-customer-testimonials.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-influencer-marketing-customer-testimonials-300x149.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-influencer-marketing-customer-testimonials-750x373.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And on Instagram:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-instagram-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20445" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-instagram-customer-testimonials.png" alt="marucci-instagram-customer-testimonials" width="640" height="227" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-instagram-customer-testimonials.png 837w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-instagram-customer-testimonials-300x106.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-instagram-customer-testimonials-750x266.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And on Facebook:</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-facebook-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20444" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-facebook-customer-testimonials.png" alt="marucci-facebook-customer-testimonials" width="493" height="423" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-facebook-customer-testimonials.png 493w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/marucci-facebook-customer-testimonials-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Your brand doesn’t have to be this holistic about influencer marketing, though. You can always do one-off campaigns like Flash Tattoos –– who partnered with Beyonce in 2015.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-flash-tattoos-customer-testimonials.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20443" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-flash-tattoos-customer-testimonials.png" alt="beyonce-flash-tattoos-customer-testimonials" width="640" height="411" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-flash-tattoos-customer-testimonials.png 837w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-flash-tattoos-customer-testimonials-300x193.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-flash-tattoos-customer-testimonials-750x482.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How Beyonce and Flash Tattoos Made Influencer Marketing History</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253745">The collaboration didn&#8217;t happen overnight, but the sales sure did. </a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">Marketing Materials</h2>
<p class="p1">Include customer testimonials in as much of your marketing material as possible. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Emails</li>
<li class="p1">Physical mailers</li>
<li class="p1">Packages</li>
<li class="p1">Social media posts</li>
<li class="p1">Events</li>
<li class="p1">Ads</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Why? Well, this goes back to an old rule of thumb in advertising called the “Rule of Sevens,” and unfortunately there is no exact date to back it up.</p>
<p class="p1">Call it an old wives tales –– at least getting to the exact number 7. There are studies, though, that show increased exposure sticks better in someone’s memory. Some studies even point to a “<a href="http://www.labsag.co.uk/demo/Docs/Manuales-de-Simuladores/profesores/Lecturas/Adstrat/Beyond-effective-frequency.pdf">Rule of Threes:</a>”</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Krugman (1972; 1977) captured the imagination of the industry with his three-exposure theory, which described an intuitively appealing sequence of consumer responses to television advertising that appeared to be consistent with a communication threshold. He suggested that the first exposure causes consumers to ask, “What is it?” The second causes them to ask, “What of it?” The third exposure is both a reminder and the beginning of disengagement. … The magic number “three” came to be a commonly accepted industry standard (Lancaster, Kreshel and Harris 1986). [Cannon and Leckenby]</em></p>
<p class="p1">Either way, your customer testimonials help to move consumers through your funnel. Find testimonials that fit each cohort –– both in terms of demographic as well as purchasing cycle. That means you will need testimonials that fit top of funnel, mid-funnel and bottom of funnel — and likely multiple iterations of each.</p>
<p class="p1">Where do you use those? In all of your marketing materials.</p>
<h1 class="p4">Using Testimonials to Increase Retention</h1>
<h2 class="p3">Providing Incentives</h2>
<p class="p1">Incentivizing customers to review their purchase is a sensitive area. Offer too much, or ask too frequently, and it can easily seem as though you’re coercing positive feedback. With some creativity, however, you can build testimonials into your retention strategies so that customers want to leave positive reviews about your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Before you do anything though –– just ask your customer to review the product. Once they have received their order, shoot them an email a week later to ask about their experience.</p>
<p class="p1">If that doesn’t work, play on a loyalty program and give those who review your products a discount or points incentive for doing so.</p>
<p class="p1">In other words, don’t give up the discount too early.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Responding To Testimonials</h2>
<p class="p1">While responding to customers’ testimonials may seem like a given, the way in which you respond can make a difference. The key is to always invite customers back for another purchase. Here are a few steps on how to respond to both positive and negative reviews that will lead customers back again.</p>
<p class="p1">When responding to positive customer testimonials:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Thank them</li>
<li class="p1">Make it personal</li>
<li class="p1">Invite them back for more</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">When responding to negative customer testimonials:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Apologize</li>
<li class="p1">Own up to it, and if applicable, try explaining the situation</li>
<li class="p1">Share the steps you are taking to remedy and improve the customer experience for next time</li>
<li class="p1">Invite them back again</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="p4">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p class="p1">Expect to receive testimonials across all of your sales channels (and even places where you do not sell!). These includes your social channels, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/amazon/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ebay/">eBay</a>, your webstore, Yelp, Google, Glassdoor and many others. Be sure to monitor all customer touchpoints daily so you never miss the chance to respond, engage, drive loyalty and build customer lifetime value (as well as SEO and ad copy for the future!).</p>
<p class="p1">As digital marketing continues to become more of a challenge every day, utilizing testimonials will help your business stand out among the rest — becoming a representation of your customer service in the process.</p>
