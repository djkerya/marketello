<p class="p1">My answer?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-ads-tips/">Invest in local Facebook ads</a>, and then retarget, retarget, retarget.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">. . . and then comes the inevitable question.</p>
<p class="p1">“But how?!”</p>
<p class="p1">Like most marketing efforts, the recipe for success isn’t a sexy, breakthrough tactic. You’re not one counterintuitive “growth hack” away from 100x ROI.</p>
<p class="p1">People often focus purely on creating their remarketing campaigns and placing retargeting pixels, then assume they can set and forget. Make no mistake — you can shoot yourself in the foot by not creating the right strategy from the get-go.</p>
<p class="p1">But in my experience, the secret to effective retargeting campaigns is careful management, analysis, and optimization.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not easy, but there are some basic principles you can follow to avoid the landmines frequently stepped on by marketers of every ilk.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>But first of all….</strong></p>
<h3 class="p3">What is retargeting?</h3>
<p class="p1">Retargeting is a cookie-based technology that displays custom advertisements to visitors who leave an online store without purchasing or performing another desired action.</p>
<p class="p1">Expansive third-party ad networks, such as Facebook and Google Display Network, enable ads to be displayed across the web, reminding customers of products they viewed or added to cart.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that we’ve officially defined it, let’s explore the following –– and unbelievably common –– mistakes, so you can learn what not to do before diving into your retargeting efforts.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Mistake #1. Segmentation</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>You’re targeting the default “All Visitors” audience.</strong></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21258" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-1.png" alt="retargeting campaigns" width="640" height="95" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-1.png 926w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-1-300x45.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-1-750x112.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of All Visitors audience in AdWords</em></p>
<p class="p1">Different customers came to the site for different reasons. They visited different pages. The pages they visited represent different intents.</p>
<p class="p1">Lumping all these customers into one group is a big mistake.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’re treating all your customers like they’re one demographic, you’re lacking something called <em>segmentation.</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">Mistake #2. Recency</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>You’re using the default 30-day cookie window.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Not every site has a stereotypical 30-day buyer path. The conversion path varies greatly depending on the website, product type, and industry.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at the path length for two of our clients. Both are ecommerce companies, but they focus on different verticals. You’ll notice that the first company has a longer conversion path than the second company.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21257" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-2.png" alt="facebook retargeting tips" width="640" height="346" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-2.png 713w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-2-300x162.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of Conversion Time Lag for Client #1</em></p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21256" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-3.png" alt="remarketing tips" width="640" height="350" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-3.png 707w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-3-300x164.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of Conversion Time Lag for Client #2</em></p>
<p class="p1">By using the default 30-day cookie window, you’re either:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Wasting your budget</strong> by serving too many ads to customers who have a short conversion path, or</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Limiting your opportunity</strong> to buyers who have a long conversion path.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">By using a 30-day time window, you’re <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/online-brand-strategy/multichannel-strategies/underestimated-growth-pattern-ecommerce-companies-rfm-model/">throwing fish back into the pond</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Mistake #3. Frequency</h2>
<p class="p1">Another critical mistake:<strong> you have no ad frequency limit.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">InSkin Media<a href="http://www.inskinmedia.com/blog/infographic-environment-matters-improving-online-brand-experiences/"> studied U.S. consumer emotions</a> associated with retargeting ads and determined that ad frequency had a negative impact on buyer emotions.</p>
<p class="p1">Heavy ad frequency changes a buyer’s outlook from positive to creeped out. It can be intrusive, annoying, and worse yet &#8212; it may cause customers to become angry with your brand.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/facebook-ad-frequency.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21255" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/facebook-ad-frequency.png" alt="retargeting platform list" width="640" height="269" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/facebook-ad-frequency.png 700w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/facebook-ad-frequency-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>The negative impact of high ad frequency (via<a href="http://www.inskinmedia.com/blog/infographic-environment-matters-improving-online-brand-experiences/"> InSkin Media</a>)</em></p>
<p class="p1">As you can see, the more a customer interacts with a particular ad, the less likely they are to buy the product featured in the ad.</p>
<p class="p1">If you have no ad frequency limit, you’re basically waving a flag with your brand’s logo on it in your customer’s faces, blowing an airhorn in their ear, and tying their shoes together. One or two well-placed billboards along their morning commute would suffice.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Mistake #4. Creative</h2>
<p class="p1"><strong>Using the same boring creative assets across the board.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Think about it &#8212; if you have one static ad displayed across all channels you’ll induce “banner blindness” — especially without a frequency limit in place. It’s saturation, plain and simple. You’re showing your ads too much, and suddenly people just stop seeing them.</p>
<p class="p1">Customers will ignore your ad the same way you ignore the speed limit signs on your home street. You know what the sign says, has always said, and you presume to know what it’ll always say. Don’t bury your ads in plain sight.</p>
<p class="p1">According to an Infolinks study,<a href="http://www.infolinks.com/blog/infographic/the-banner-blindness-infographic/"> 86% of U.S. consumers</a> suffer from “banner blindness.”</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/banner-blindness.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21254" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/banner-blindness.png" alt="custom audience" width="640" height="341" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/banner-blindness.png 874w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/banner-blindness-300x160.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/banner-blindness-750x399.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>“Banner Blindness” Stats (via<a href="http://www.infolinks.com/blog/infographic/the-banner-blindness-infographic/"> InfoLinks</a>)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">No wonder 86.6 million Americans are planning to use ad blocker in 2017!</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The numbers put ad blockers in a wholly separate territory than your usual internet trend. This isn’t colored browsing tabs &#8212; it’s WordPress all over again. A significant portion of the entire internet are using those services, and that’s only going to intensify as time goes on.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at the visual below. In a short few years (this dataset reaches back to 2014), ad blockers have skyrocketed in popularity:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21253" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-4.png" alt="retargeting pixel" width="640" height="589" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-4.png 700w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-4-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Ad Blocker Stats (via<a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Chart/US-Ad-Blocking-Users-Penetration-2014-2017/192683"> eMarketer</a>)</em></p>
<p class="p1">In a word, it means you’ve got to make your ads count. They’re getting less play from customers everywhere, and it’s up to you to intelligently make use of the time and attention they do get.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Mistake #5. Magic Bullets</h2>
<p class="p1">You spend time looking for a <strong>“magic bullet”</strong> in marketing blogs, podcasts, webinars, and courses instead of putting your head down, and executing on proven ideas.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll never get it right the first time, and that shouldn’t be discouraging. Practice makes perfect. If it were that easy, everyone would opt for these magic bullet strategies.</p>
<p class="p1">No magic bullet tactic can, or will, make your business successful. I feel so strongly about it, I have a saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Magic Bullets are for losers. Execution is key.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Marketing is about developing a clear strategy, and executing it systematically.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll need to do the hard work yourself. You’ll have to test, learn, and test some more until you know exactly what to offer to your market.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://conversionxl.com/working-hard-doesnt-matter-if-you-dont-know-what-youre-doing-rant/">Peep Laja from ConversionXL</a> agrees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Everybody wants wins, but nobody wants to do the hard work of doing proper conversion research, actually figuring out what matters and developing a systematic approach.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">If you’re looking for that one-punch-knockout in your first fight, you’re making a big mistake.</p>
<h2 class="p7">So, What Does it All Mean? A Note on Granular Ad Campaigns [+ a Framework!]</h2>
<p class="p1">So, we just looked at a few mistakes that are causing your ads to become too general, too frequent, or too annoying. You’re probably not sure exactly where things are going wrong.</p>
<p class="p1">U.S. consumers want brands to be useful, and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-personalization/">they want their experiences personalized</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, data from MyBuys’<a href="https://www.websitemagazine.com/blog/consumers-demand-personalized-shopping-experiences"> 7th Annual Personalization Report</a> revealed that consumers overwhelmingly prefer to purchase from retailers who:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Suggest products based on their browsing or buying behavior (53%)</li>
<li class="p1">Personalize online ads that promote offers and products from websites they visited (49%)</li>
<li class="p1">Show <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-ad-targeting/">personalized ads in social media feeds</a> (33%)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The bottom line is this: consumers purchase and engage more when they receive a truly personalized shopping experience in a consistent, coordinated fashion.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personalized-retargeting-campaigns.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21252" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personalized-retargeting-campaigns.png" alt="real-time bidding" width="640" height="388" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personalized-retargeting-campaigns.png 809w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personalized-retargeting-campaigns-300x182.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/personalized-retargeting-campaigns-750x455.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>7th Annual Personalization Report (via<a href="https://info.magnetic.com/7th-annual-report-on-consumer-personalization.html"> MyBuys</a>)</em></p>
<p class="p1">To personalize your customer’s shopping experience, you need to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">How buyers use your website</li>
<li class="p1">What their pain points are</li>
<li class="p1">How to address those pain points</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Once you know those things, you can become granular. You can personalize your ad experience based on your store.</p>
<p class="p1">Be forewarned &#8212; when you go granular and start growing your campaigns, things get messy. Tactics will change, and so will the platforms. Don’t panic. It’s about staying consistent.</p>
<p class="p1">So, how do you stay consistent?</p>
<p class="p1">The framework of your campaign is the holy grail of consistency. It’ll help you systematically adapt your approach for any industry.</p>
<p class="p1">See the example below:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-5.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21251" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-5.png" alt="email retargeting" width="640" height="164" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-5.png 1050w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-5-300x77.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-5-750x192.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Retargeting Matrix Example via<a href="https://www.scubemarketing.com/blog/retargeting-matrix"> SCUBE Marketing</a></em></p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a breakdown of what you’re looking at in the above visual:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">We’re targeting buyers in the “Product Page Visitors” segment. It includes people who <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">abandoned a product page</a> before adding anything to their cart. I call this whole sheet a “Buyer Segment.”</li>
<li class="p1">This Buyer Segment is broken down into 3 Recency Segments, which are based on how recently each customer interacted with the Buyer Segment. Recency Segments are clearly visualized for ease of understanding.</li>
<li class="p1">Each Buyer Segment and Recency Segment have corresponding hooks, each of which serve to portray the essence of the ad.</li>
<li class="p1">Buyer and Recency Segments are running on Facebook Advertising and AdWords channels. Both channels have consistency.</li>
<li class="p1">Finally, the respective Targeting and Exclusion audiences are presented and mapped to each segment for easy implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The strategy for this segment is pretty clear. This visual is a snapshot of a<a href="https://www.scubemarketing.com/blog/retargeting-matrix"> Retargeting Matrix framework</a> I developed.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Learn More About RFM Models and How to Implement One for Your Business</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Did you know you can use BigCommerce Analytics to build an RFM model? <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/rfm-model/">Here’s exactly how to do it.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p7">The Retargeting Matrix Framework</h2>
<p class="p1">I’ve covered the Retargeting Matrix framework in<a href="https://www.scubemarketing.com/blog/webinar-recap-retargeting-matrix-a-framework-i-bet-you-havent-thought-about"> blogs</a>,<a href="http://www.unofficialshopifypodcast.com/episodes/59098-the-remarketing-matrix-10x-your-remarketing-campaigns-with-this-procedure"> podcasts</a> and<a href="https://www.semrush.com/webinars/retargeting-matrix-a-framework-i-bet-you-havent-thought-about/?language=en"> presentations</a>. The framework helps you systematically plan, implement, and scale retargeting campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">It forces you to approach your campaigns strategically, and it presents the plan in an easily-understood format.</p>
<p class="p1">The Retargeting Matrix represents 4 levers:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Buyer Segments</li>
<li class="p1">Recency Segments</li>
<li class="p1">Hooks</li>
<li class="p1">Channels</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Here’s how you can apply that to your campaigns.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Lever #1. Buyer Segments</h3>
<p class="p1">It all starts with Buyer Segments.</p>
<p class="p1">Segmentation is an old trick, and it’s still popular in marketing for a reason &#8212; it can be a strong contributing factor to better campaign ROI.<a href="http://www.emailmonday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/National-client-email-2015-DMA.pdf"> Direct Marketing Association</a> attributes 77% of ROI to segmented, targeted, and triggered campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">In the context of retargeting, I’m referring to segments based on URLs your buyers visit. Why does that matter? People visiting different URLs have a different intent.</p>
<p class="p1">Each segment has a different behavior, and they need to be marketed differently. Your Retargeting Matrix will have a tab with details on each Buyer Segment. You’ll have a clear picture of what each segment is, what their objectives are, and you’ll know how to market to buyers in each of those segments.</p>
<p class="p1">See the example below:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-6.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21250" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-6.png" alt="retargeting strategy" width="640" height="177" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-6.png 1086w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-6-300x83.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-6-750x208.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<h3 class="p9">How To Create Buyer Segments</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>First, define an intended buyer path on your website.</strong> This is critical.</p>
<p class="p1">Name the Buyer Segments based on intent. The number of segments you can capture on your website depends on the complexity of your website.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about a simplified version of the buyer’s journey as it applies to visitors to your site:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-8.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21248" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-8.png" alt="" width="640" height="129" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-8.png 940w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-8-300x60.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-8-750x151.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Simplified Buyer’s Journey</em></p>
<p class="p1">Based on the example above, you have a few different Buyer Segments:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Home page visitors</li>
<li class="p1">Product page visitors</li>
<li class="p1">Abandoned cart visitors</li>
<li class="p1">Recent customers</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><strong>Next, group website URLs into different Buyer Segments.</strong> The buyers will self-identify what segment they belong to based on the pages they visit.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Third, understand minimum segment granularity</strong> by adding up the 30 day traffic for all URLs in each Buyer Segment. Find the Landing Pages report in Google Analytics by navigating to Behavior -&gt; Site Content -&gt; Landing Pages.</p>
<p class="p1">This is important!</p>
<p class="p1">Every retargeting channel has a minimum audience size, which will directly affect how granular you can get. If you create segments that don’t meet the minimum requirements, your ads won’t be served. Your only alternative would be to get more traffic to these buyer segments.</p>
<p class="p1">See the screenshot below:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-9.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21247" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-9.png" alt="" width="640" height="392" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-9.png 804w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-9-300x184.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-9-750x459.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Landing Pages Report in Google Analytics</em></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Finally, set an objective and an intended action for each Buyer Segment.</strong> The easiest way to do this is to take each segment, define what users are doing on your site, and add your goals for them (what you want them to do).</p>
<h3 class="p3">Lever #2. Recency Segments</h3>
<p class="p1">Your buyers have different urgency depending on their recency. That’s because buyer intent progresses over time, as users make their way through your funnel. Some users will go from 0 to 100 quickly, but by and large, there’s a “getting to know you” process.</p>
<p class="p1">The next step is to break down your Buyer Segments into Recency Segments. Each Buyer Segment will be broken down into further segments based on the last visit to that segment.</p>
<p class="p1">In the example below, the Decision segment visitors are broken down into 3 groups:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">0 &#8211; 30 days</li>
<li class="p1">31 &#8211; 60 days</li>
<li class="p1">61 &#8211; 90 days</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="p9">How To Create Recency Segments</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>First, define segment depth.</strong> How deep and granular you can get? It depends on two things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your traffic over a 30 day period in the segment (see minimum granularity above)</li>
<li class="p1">The length of your customer’s journey</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Let’s explore the customer journey, as it’s very relevant to this topic.</p>
<p class="p1">Customer journey varies by industry, size, and business type. In the chart below, I mapped the customer journey for medium-sized businesses in the shopping industry using Google’s customer journey mapping tool.</p>
<p class="p1">Notice that you need up to 5 touch points before influencing a buyer to purchase:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-12.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21244" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-12.png" alt="" width="640" height="306" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-12.png 644w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-12-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>The Customer Journey to Online Purchase via<a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/tools/customer-journey-to-online-purchase.html"> ThinkWithGoogle</a>.</em></p>
<p class="p1">To determine the customer journey for your own store, <strong>use the Path Length report in Google Analytics.</strong> It will show you exactly how many interactions your buyers take before converting.</p>
<p class="p1">In the example below, 69% of first-time interactions lead to conversions, and 25% of customers needed between two and four interactions. This is your opportunity for retargeting intelligently.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-13.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21243" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-13.png" alt="" width="618" height="415" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-13.png 618w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-13-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Path Length Report in Google Analytics</em></p>
<p class="p1">Now, let’s get to the recency. The <strong>Time Lag Report</strong> in Google Analytics reports on how many days your buyers take to convert. This report is similar to the Path Length report, but it’s measured in days.</p>
<p class="p1">The example below shows that the conversion window on the site is fairly short, since 86% of visitors convert the same day they make their initial visit. If you’re seeing data like this, it means you probably don’t need granular audiences requiring months of retargeting.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-14.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21242" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-14.png" alt="" width="640" height="268" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-14.png 936w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-14-300x126.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-14-750x314.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Time Lag Report in Google Analytics</em></p>
<p class="p1">Next, <strong>define your Recency Segments</strong>. By knowing the depth of your customer journey and traffic, you’ll also know how to break up your Buyer Segments into more granular Recency Segments.</p>
<p class="p1">The reason we break everything down by time is urgency. Urgency goes down with time, and your objective is to adjust your ads based on recency.</p>
<p class="p1">Some of your buyers will move from one Buyer Segment to another, progressing ever-closer toward a purchase. Some will remain in one segment longer. Everyone’s different.</p>
<p class="p1">Recency Segments will help you move these buyers from their initial segments into the next. You’ll be able to create ads tailored to the individual intent of not only Buyer Segments, but Recency Segments, too.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Lever #3. Hooks</h3>
<p class="p1">Once you have the Buyer and Recency Segments figured out, you can perform customer research. This will allow you to discover a segment’s intent, and it’ll help you develop appropriate hooks (a.k.a. ad angles) for each segment.</p>
<p class="p1">Jay Conrad Levinson<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234202"> defines a hook</a> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“a tease, a sample, and a mental appetizer. The hook should give your prospects just enough taste to leave them wanting more.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">In the example below, we have a dedicated hook for the respective Buyer and Recency Segment.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-15.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21241" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-15.png" alt="" width="640" height="168" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-15.png 1066w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-15-300x79.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-15-750x197.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Retargeting Matrix Example </em></p>
<h3 class="p9">How to Create Hooks</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>First, you need to understand the pain points of your buyers.</strong> You can’t accomplish this without performing customer research.</p>
<p class="p1">Your customer research will fuel your hooks for each segment when creating retargeting campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">How do you find out what your customers want? I’ve covered customer research in detail in my article about<a href="https://www.scubemarketing.com/blog/how-to-win-with-facebook-ads-when-you-dont-have-a-big-ad-budget"> Facebook Ads</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">I recommend starting with four methods and tools:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Method #1. Customer Review Sites</li>
<li class="p1">Method #2. Live Chat and Help Desk Logs</li>
<li class="p1">Method #3. Customer Survey</li>
<li class="p1">Method #4. On-Page Surveys</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">They will reveal a great deal of useful information you can act on.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Second, develop hooks for different segments.</strong> Different buyers are in different frames of mind. To have effective retargeting, you have to know what they want, and you have to communicate it to them in their words.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about the decision process, and the pain points of each segment (hopefully your research has revealed that).</p>
<p class="p1">Using that information, you can develop hooks to engage with each audience and address their pain points. Your objective doesn’t change &#8212; you need to be proactive, and you need to help your customers through the process with gentle nudges.</p>

<h3 class="p1">Example: Shopping Cart Segment, Issue: Trust</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">69% of shopping carts</a> are abandoned (based on 37 different studies). I’ll explore this segment as a result.</p>
<p class="p1">Any number of things can impact a shopper’s online experience. Even taking for granted how popular and widespread online shopping has become, it’s a given that we behave differently from one another when making our purchases. If we didn’t, there’d be no such thing as remarketing campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">Any number of things push or pull us in different directions when shopping online. Our decisions are easily influenced. While there’s still some mysteries to solve, we know plenty about these factors to make actionable decisions.</p>
<p class="p1">The factors that carry the most influence over shopping behavior include <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">speed of delivery and order fulfilment, brand reputation, and shipping costs</a> &#8212; the usual suspects.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at some of the other major deciding factors influencing shoppers:</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-16.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21240" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-16.png" alt="" width="636" height="527" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-16.png 636w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-16-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" /></a></p>

<h3 class="p3">Lever #4. Retargeting Channels</h3>
<p class="p1">Once you have Buyer Segments, Recency Segments, and Hooks ironed out, it’s time to implement your knowledge.</p>
<p class="p1">At this point, you should have a nice document with a framework that can be implemented on any retargeting platform, be it Google AdWords, Facebook Ads, AdRoll, or a combination of platforms.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>To implement your framework, first map the Buyer and Recency Segments and their respective hooks across the retargeting channels.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Your message will be consistent across the board. When making a decision, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which platforms will reach the most users in your target audience?</li>
<li>Which platforms are the best fit given the size of your site?</li>
<li>Which platforms will reach a unique audience, and which will cannibalize your existing efforts?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The example below uses two retargeting platforms: Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.</p>
<p class="p6" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-17.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21239" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-17.png" alt="" width="640" height="169" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-17.png 1093w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-17-300x79.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/retargeting-campaigns-17-750x198.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Retargeting Matrix Example </em></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Second &#8211; develop audiences in the respective retargeting platforms.</strong> This includes both audiences &#8212; who you want to target, and who you want to exclude. The Retargeting Marketing Framework allows you to visualize the audience structure.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Third &#8211; develop campaign and ad group structure based on the matrix.</strong> Use Buyer Segments as Campaigns, and Recency Segments as Ad Groups/Ad Sets. This structure helps with evaluating performance, which allows you to make tweaks where necessary.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Fourth &#8211; develop your ad copy and creative.</strong> Use the Retargeting Marketing Framework as a spec sheet for your creative team. You have the audiences, objectives, and hooks.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Fifth &#8211; hit launch, and monitor.</strong></p>
<h3 class="p7">Final Thoughts on Retargeting</h3>
<p class="p1">Let’s stop for a moment and let everything sink in.</p>
<p class="p1">Retargeting can be managed effectively. Remember, it&#8217;s about going back to basics and knowing how your buyers use your website, what their pain points are, and then executing on a campaign that helps them make an informed decision.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you get the basics down, you can start with the really fun stuff like mobile retargeting — but one thing at a time.</p>
<p class="p1">You have all the tools you need. You have a framework you can use to plan, develop, and scale retargeting campaigns — the way professionals do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="2000" height="920" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-hero.png" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-hero.png 2000w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-hero-300x138.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-hero-750x345.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p class="p1">A few years after high school, I read “The 4-Hour Workweek,” quit my job and moved to Buenos Aires. I was convinced I could run a business while traveling, making U.S. dollars and spending Argentinian pesos, while chatting over Skype with a supplier in China, coffee in my hand and tea in theirs.</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted this to work. I selected a few products and hired expensive web developers to build me a site. All that ever came of it was a few ugly pages and an endless amount of 404s before I ran out of money.</p>
<p class="p1">My plans for an endless vacation failed miserably, and quickly, as did 6 other ideas I had had prior. I decided to go back to college and abandon my dream.</p>

<p class="p1">My plans for an endless vacation failed miserably, and quickly, as did 6 other ideas I had had prior. I decided to go back to college and abandon my dream.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">You’d think maybe I wasn’t a good businessman, but youth was on my side. And, as it turns out, so was technology.</p>
<p class="p1">I started my current business, <a href="https://www.flexfireleds.com/">Flexfire LEDs</a>, in 2010. I was a junior in college at the time and refused to give up on what I knew was possible. I could see that LEDs were the future of the way we light our planet, and I wanted to be a part of it.</p>
<p class="p1">Prior to 2010, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-start-online-business/">starting an online business</a> was near impossible. Trust me. I tried.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">It took knowing how to code to build the site.</li>
<li class="p1">It took having the right connections to get yourself a single product.</li>
<li class="p1">It took earning trust –– not to mention traffic –– just to get a sale.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Some of those things are still very true.</p>
<p class="p1">You still need to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-drive-traffic-convert-customers/">earn trust and drive traffic</a>. But you don’t have to know how to code anymore to build yourself a site. Nor do you necessarily need connections in the industry to get yourself some great products.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Widespread internet usage solves for the latter</strong> –– where you can Google suppliers and build relationships.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>And technology like BigCommerce solves for the former</strong> –– where you can build a site and customize it without touching a single piece of code.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The only problem left to solve is the need to drive traffic and trust. And on this, I have become an expert.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The Business of B2B</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Our customer base is split 50/50 for homeowners (regular consumers) and businesses (B2B). And yet, only 20% of our revenue comes from our B2C segment.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Today, Flexfire LEDs drives more than $5M in annual sales. Our customer base is split 50/50 for homeowners (regular consumers) and businesses (B2B). And yet, only 20% of our revenue comes from our B2C segment.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s because businesses buying from other businesses buy in bulk –– and they buy often. Their large, regular orders drive the majority of our business. And, we partner with the best in the industry:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Kohler</li>
<li class="p1">Boeing</li>
<li class="p1">Disney</li>
<li class="p1">Marriott</li>
<li class="p1">Google</li>
<li class="p1">Apple</li>
<li class="p1">Bellagio</li>
<li class="p1">Embassy Suites</li>
<li class="p1">Ford Motors</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The list goes on.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, of course, earning customers like that and hitting a multi-million dollar revenue mark didn’t happen overnight.</p>
<p class="p1">But it did happen between 2013 and 2015 –– when our business was growing 832%.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>BigCommerce's B2B Power</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Flexfire LEDs isn&#8217;t the only B2B company using BigCommerce to skyrocket growth. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/atlanta-light-bulbs/">Read more about how Atlanta Light Bulbs uses the platform to scale their B2B business faster than ever before</a>.</p>

<h2 class="p3">How to Earn a 832% Increase in Revenue</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Little did we know, we were following Google’s “best marketing practices for 2017” book back in 2010. Each Google update in the subsequent years shot our rankings up and our competition down.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">In 2013, Google released Hummingbird, the single largest change to Google’s search algorithm in 12 years.</p>
<p class="p2">This wasn’t an update like Panda or Penguin. This was a completely new algorithm –– this time, focused on conversational and semantic search. The goal was to deliver more accurate search results –– as any Google algorithm update always is.</p>
<p class="p1">But in 2013, it was incredibly needed because the results Google kept showing weren’t any good at all.</p>
<p class="p2">And that’s because back in 2010 and 2011, SEO techniques were pretty much centered around this thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Trick Google into ranking you higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Everyone was doing it. That was back when there were link farms and content companies that would write junk keyword-stuffed articles in less than 500 words. The content wasn’t good, needless to say.</p>
<p class="p1">We went a different route.</p>
<p class="p1">I like to think of Google as an all-powerful librarian.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">What would the librarian want to see to recommend the best book to the person asking for it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">That is always how I’ve approached content and Google –– and in 2013, it paid off.</p>
<p class="p1">Big time.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s because we started creating content in 2010 that answered the questions we had ourselves when first researching LED strip lights and how to install them.</p>
<p class="p1">We didn&#8217;t focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Link building strategies</li>
<li class="p1">Spamming forums with linkbacks</li>
<li class="p1">Creating 500 word keyword stuffed blogs on non-relevant websites</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">We focused on:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Education</li>
<li class="p1">Customer experience</li>
<li class="p1">Adding value</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Little did we know, we were following Google’s “best marketing practices for 2017” book back in 2010. Each Google update in the subsequent years shot our rankings up and our competition down.</p>
<p class="p1">Organic traffic has always been our biggest source of traffic. Our first sale came from <a href="https://www.flexfireleds.com/top-4-considerations-before-buying-flexible-led-strip-lights/">one of our articles</a> explaining the technical difference between two types of LEDs.</p>
<p class="p1">And it is our educational content that builds brand trust and traffic –– even among the industry’s most trusted brands themselves.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The 8 Business Principles to Long Term Success</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I know all too well thanks to my years of entrepreneurial setbacks that to focus on immediate profit meant near immediate failure.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">To stick it out back then, and to follow our gut on what we knew was good content –– but content that didn&#8217;t immediately get the traffic it deserved –– was hard.</p>
<p class="p1">It took dedication and conviction to business principles others were forgoing in the name of immediate profit.</p>
<p class="p1">I knew all too well thanks to my years of entrepreneurial setbacks that to focus on immediate profit meant near immediate failure.</p>
<p class="p1">The principle I stuck with back then was the same as Amazon’s is now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">To be customer-centric, to educate and to add value, to be a source of trusted information, and quality products for when they are ready to actually buy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Some folks out there call this the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization/">value ladder approach</a>. Others say it is how Amazon hockey-sticked to unparalleled ecommerce dominance.</p>
<p class="p1">For me, it’s about following these 8 principles on a daily basis so my own business will be successful for the long haul.</p>
<p class="p1">These will lead you to success, they have for me.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, it won’t always be easy. You can rest assured, though, that the markets favor those who treat the customer well. These principles will keep you aligned with what is best for them, which is ultimately, if not immediately, what is always best for your bottom line.</p>
<h3 class="p4">1. Always take it one step further<span class="s1"><br />
</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Whenever you think you have gone as far as you can, ask yourself if you can take one step further.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">I call this the OSF (one step further) mentality and it dictates that you always take that additional step for your employees, your customers, and with your products.</p>
<p class="p1">Whenever you think you have gone as far as you can, ask yourself if you can take one step further.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Do things your competitors aren&#8217;t doing</strong>, or do them just a little better. Word travels fast –– especially online.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Do things that your clients don’t expect</strong>. Today, we sent out boxes of girl scout cookies in the orders that went out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Why? Who does that?</p>
<p class="p1">We do! Why not!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Create a special experience for your customers in your own way</strong>. You are in the business of building a relationship with your customers and your brand. Reviews are VERY IMPORTANT for an online company. Even a few bad ones can be damaging. Take that extra step to make everyone happy, even the problem customers. It will come back around.</p>
<h3 class="p4">2. Focus on content –– really good content.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Write down everything that frustrates you about your industry, competitors, product, and keep adding to that list on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">By focusing on education and a &#8220;one-step-further&#8221; approach to our customer service, Flexfire LEDs was able solve the biggest hurdles in the buying process for our customers and started generating sales the first month of business.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>My advice to you to do the same is</strong>: write down everything that frustrates you about your industry, competitors, product, and keep adding to that list on a daily basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Each one of these notes is a potential game changer in your industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Many trees add up to a forest. Again, OSF!</p>
<p class="p1">If you get the same question more than 5 times from customers writing in, consider writing a nice article educating your customers about it. Better yet, make a video.</p>
<p class="p1">Focus on education and creating a wonderful experience with your customer service. Be the company that you wish was always there for you when something went wrong. Pleasantly surprise your clients.</p>
<h3 class="p4">3. Automate, read, repeat.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Books are like a cheat-sheet to the open note test that is life and business.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Use technology and educate yourself!</p>
<p class="p1">There are hundreds of apps, outsourcing services, and ways to automate processes that are here now that weren&#8217;t a few years ago. Take some time and think the processes through, then automate.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, we use:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/bigcommerce/trello/">Trello</a> for project management</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/bigcommerce/slack/">Slack</a> for communication internally</li>
<li class="p1">All Google apps (gmail, google drive, sheets, docs, etc)</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shipstation/">Shipstation</a> and <a href="https://www.fishbowlcommerce.com/bigcommerce-inventory-software/">Fishbowl</a> for shipping and inventory</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="http://optinmonster.com/docs/how-to-integrate-optinmonster-with-bigcommerce/">OptinMonster</a> for marketing</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/mailchimp/">Mailchimp</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/activecampaign/">Active Campaign</a> for email marketing</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Setting-Up-Google-Analytics">Google Analytics</a></li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/taxjar/">Taxjar</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/avalara/">Avatax</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/quickbooks-online/">Quickbooks</a> for financial</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/stamped-io/">Stamped.io</a> for reviews</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/bigcommerce/">Zapier</a> for easy integration and APIs</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/powr-tools/">Powr.io</a> for form creation</li>
<li class="p1">BigCommerce for our ecommerce hosting</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">I also employ a variety of graphic designers, developers, and admin types through Upwork, and have built out a virtual team to be able to take on additional tasks. Plus, thanks to the virtual, global team, we now have a global market to search from for employment.</p>
<p class="p1">That will give you more time to read.</p>
<p class="p1">You can start with the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357">4 Hour Work Week</a>” and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Less-Doing-Entrepreneurs-Beautiful/dp/1619614421/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495722023&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+doing+less">The Art of Less Doing</a>,” both of which educate you on how to do more, better, and in less time. The answers to many questions you have or will eventually have are already written and available. Read often.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Books are like a cheat-sheet to the open note test that is life and business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Here’s a list of books that have helped me with always maintaining a leadership mindset and have given me instantly effective lessons on how to better run a business.</p>

</ol>
<h3 class="p4">4. Ask for help and advice.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Whatever hurdle you encounter, someone else has probably solved it before you.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">I bootstrapped the whole company for the first two years. During that time, I outsourced a lot of work and came across a million challenges. The short story is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">I made mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Just about every day I came across a new challenge. My biggest lesson was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Whatever hurdle you encounter, someone else has probably solved it before you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Whenever I was stuck, I would reach out to anyone I think could have the answer. Don’t be afraid to reach out to thought leaders, other CEOs, university professors, or even authors and celebrities if you think they can help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Successful people love to help other people succeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Whenever I would get nervous about asking for help, I would think, “It feels great to offer advice and help others, right? Yeah! Why would I take that opportunity to feel great away from someone else?</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s an actual example of how I started my relationship with one of the most influential mentors I have ever had:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-contact-example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21131" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-contact-example.png" alt="" width="640" height="287" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-contact-example.png 961w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-contact-example-300x135.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-contact-example-750x336.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4">5. Start with your vision then work backwards.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Use your imagination to paint a picture of what you want your business to look like in 3 years.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">You cannot choose which path to take if you don’t know where you want to go.</p>
<p class="p1">In the book, “Double Double” by Cameron Herold, the first few chapters are an outline of the most powerful exercise that changed the course of our company.</p>
<p class="p1">I attribute a lot of our success to it and recommend it to all entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s called the Vivid Vision exercise and in short, it calls on you to use your imagination to paint a picture of what you want your business to look like in 3 years.</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine a painting that is composed of every aspect of your life and business 3 years from now. Notice as many details as possible. You’re making money and having fun.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">What do you see?</li>
<li class="p1">Who are your clients?</li>
<li class="p1">How many employees do you have?</li>
<li class="p1">Which magazines are talking about your products?</li>
<li class="p1">Which awards have you won in your industry?</li>
<li class="p1">What do your employees say about your company?</li>
<li class="p1">Are you commuting or teleconferencing?</li>
<li class="p1">What does the desk in your office look like?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Each detail outlined in your picture is a goal. Take that goal and work backward and you will create an actionable plan on how to obtain that goal.</p>
<p class="p1">In my vision, for example, I saw our product installed in airports around the world. I saw that if I created content about airport lighting it would attract the eyes of designers working on airport projects.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, our products are illuminating many major airports around the world!</p>
<p class="p1">Don’t wimp out. Think big!</p>
<h3 class="p4">6. Be insatiably curious.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Albert Einstein</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Curiosity drives research and innovation. Some of Flexfire LEDs’ most successful products came from the curious exploration of unrelated topics.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, an article about a melatonin supplement lead me down a rabbit hole of learning about how light affects circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Blue light can suppress melatonin production in humans. Based on this research we decided to manufacture a strip light with alternating LED chips that allow the user to select a warm, candle-like color white for bedtime, and a cool, daylight colored light for during the active parts of the day. This way your lighting does not disrupt your sleeping patterns.</p>
<p class="p1">The moral of the story is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Starting your own business requires you to learn a lot about a little and a little about a lot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Curiosity and the desire to learn are among the most important qualities I look for in employees because curious people do not back down from mental challenges and don’t give up in the middle of a research task. They’re also more fun to be around in my opinion.</p>
<p class="p1">You are going to be learning a lot about your business. Enjoy the exploration and new knowledge.</p>
<h3 class="p4">7. Know the importance of your team.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Business is not a zero sum game.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">I love my team. I really do! Even as we grow to more than 25 employees, I can say that everyone on the team is there for a reason, is in the right place, and doing the right things.</p>
<p class="p1">Creating and maintaining an internal culture of free expression, trust, openness, creativity, mentorship, and a burning desire to help our clients may sound too millennial to some, but for us it is <strong>our secret sauce</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">Notice I am not talking about the importance of hiring the right people, a strict interview process, and building the right team (which is VERY important). I am already assuming you know that.</p>
<p class="p1">When I say the importance of your team, I mean that they are very important to you and you care about them.</p>
<p class="p1">As a business owner I realize that people are spending valuable time on this planet building my dream. I believe in making it their dream, too.</p>
<p class="p1">If your best employee’s life goal is to work in another industry, spend time with him/her and help them to pursue that, even if that means them leaving your company.</p>
<p class="p1">Yes, you heard me right.</p>
<p class="p1">Help them achieve their dreams, just as they are helping you achieve yours. While they are employed by you, they will give it their all, and when they go on to achieve their goals, they would have left your company better for have been there.</p>
<p class="p1">Business is not a zero sum game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Focus on treating your employees right and it will come back to you 10X.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Invest in their health, education, and happiness and you will have loyal and a more creative and harder working staff than all your competitors.</p>
<p class="p1">Most employers believe that happiness is pay related. I believe it is a symptom of doing what you love and being appreciated.</p>
<h3 class="p4">8. Sell a product you are proud of</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">No one wants to be ripped off –– don’t be that company.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Most important, having a quality product is the only way to succeed in business. OK, not the only way, but the only way that will help you win quicker and allow you to sleep at night.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>For me, my story on this starts here:</strong></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">The LED lighting market in 2010 was still getting off the ground, but was finally becoming advanced enough to directly replace other lighting systems at a fraction of the energy usage and at a cost low enough to penetrate the market and disrupt legacy lighting technologies.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">Back then, there were many LED products and markets to choose from with low barriers to entry. The big players had not yet made their move into the market.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">I considered many types of LED products, but came to the realization that, from my garage and with $500, there was no way I could compete in the commercial lighting space once the big players got involved with high investment capabilities, extensive distribution channels, and large sales staff.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">I kept coming across a unique product called an LED strip light. It was a niche product, which meant I could build a company well before the big guys became interested in competing.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">The LED tape light could be cut every inch or so and installed practically anywhere to provide bright, crisp, and beautiful direct or indirect linear lighting almost anywhere imaginable.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">We could only imagine the endless uses and applications from such a cool product!</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">However, I noticed that almost all of the products being produced within our niche were poor quality, were inaccurately representing specifications and output data, and offered almost no education about the product.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">Frustrated, I decided to make the highest quality LED strip light in the world, and focus our company on the best product and education with the customer service I wish I had received all my life.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">I didn’t care if people used our articles and then purchased somewhere else. I just wanted them to have the correct answers about the product. They eventually come back to us when the other company’s products failed.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">It’s faster to change the industry than wait for the industry to change on its own.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">We didn’t start our company with any seed money from investors. It was just a kitchen table, a garage, a vision, and a curious mind.</p>
<p class="p1">Though we were making sales, things started very slow. I remember when we made $200 in sales in a day, we’d high five, pack it up and go to the beach or go for a hike. We were bootstrapping, so we didn’t need much to keep it going.</p>
<p class="p1">Back then, the lighting industry was (and partly still is) an antiquated offline distribution model that didn’t trust online stores. I mean, we are trying to sell light over the internet, so I understand.</p>
<p class="p1">We relied heavily on (and still do!) our online reviews and customer submitted photos to build trust in our company and products. Word of our product and service traveled fast and we started picking up sales through referrals.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s faster to change the industry than wait for the industry to change on its own.</p>
<p class="p1">And following these principles is what has lead me, my business and my team to industry leader status. We didn’t wait. We acted, we educated, we were honest and we were patient.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, I’m finally able to achieve my 4-hour work week dream. In fact, just this morning, I was on the phone with an employee in China, as they drank tea and I drank coffee.</p>
<p class="p1">In that way, my vision is complete.</p>

<p class="p1">But have you prepared yourself for the possibility of selling the business you have poured your heart and soul into?</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Maybe you need to sell out of necessity for your family?</li>
<li class="p1">Perhaps it grew too fast too soon?</li>
<li class="p1">Or the seller’s market is financially strong and it is simply the perfect time?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In my case, <a href="http://www.sosuzystamps.com/">So Suzy Stamps</a> hit the trifecta jackpot all at once.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">We were facing major family changes</li>
<li class="p1">Our business grew too fast too soon</li>
<li class="p1">The creative industry was booming</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Our reputation was in strong standing and the timeframe we were looking at selling played well into our growth trends.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2 years, we saw a 374% growth, opened a brick and mortar store and our inventory grew to more than I could handle on my own.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-7.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21104" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-7.png" alt="" width="640" height="240" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-7.png 1134w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-7-300x113.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-7-750x282.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We had hit that pivotal moment in our company where we grew too fast.  If I wanted to maintain a high customer satisfaction rate, I needed to make a decision.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Business may have been thriving, but our suppliers and manufacturers could not keep up with the demand and our customers were becoming frustrated.</p>
<p class="p1">We had hit that pivotal moment in our company where we grew too fast.  If I wanted to maintain a high customer satisfaction rate, I needed to make a decision.</p>
<p class="p1">The choices I had before me were simple:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Invest and expand</li>
<li class="p1">Walk away</li>
<li class="p1">Sell</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">My husband and I discussed the possibility of expanding and potentially manufacturing our own stamps, however, the time, money and man-power needed were too great.</p>
<p class="p1">If we went into manufacturing, we would need equipment, a new building, staff, and supplies, not to mention there would be a learning curve as neither of us had manufacturing experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">He wanted to retire, not start a second career.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Walking away was out of the question. I had invested too much time, energy and money into my company to just let it go. Besides, we were thriving.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">I did not become an entrepreneur just to walk away.  This was not a hobby, this was my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The only real option was to sell.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">But where would I go?</li>
<li class="p1">What did I need to do?</li>
<li class="p1">How much was it worth?</li>
<li class="p1">Who could help me with this process?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There were so many questions I needed answers for and not a lot of valuable information available.</p>
<h2 class="p1">6 Questions Every Owner Must Answer Before You Sell</h2>
<p class="p1">Let’s face it, the people writing the traditional selling a business “how to” books and online articles don’t know me, my customers or my industry.</p>
<p class="p1">What works for a real estate developer does not work for a stamp company. I am not making millions of dollars a year, I am a small business owner in the creative industry.</p>
<p class="p1">The most important piece of advice I can give when looking at selling your company is to listen. Listen to you, your customers and your industry.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Why do you want to sell?</strong> Is it out of necessity, continuing growth or are you looking to make a profit?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>What do you need to make your company attractive to prospective buyers?</strong> Does your website need to be updated, inventory cleaned up, marketing campaigns planned? Are your bookkeeping and financial documents in order?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>How would your customers benefit from a sale?</strong> Would there be more inventory available, faster shipping times, more product options?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Who would have the ability to grow your business the way your customers needed it?</strong> A competitor, a manufacturer, a consumer?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>How is the financial climate in your industry?</strong> Is it stagnant, growing or receding?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Where will you find a buyer?</strong> Is it in your best interest to find a broker or find one yourself through networking, conferences, industry organization or word of mouth?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Once the decision to sell was made, I knew I needed to get my house in order.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p4">Prepping to Sell My Ecommerce Business</h2>
<h3 class="p5">1. Updating the Theme</h3>
<p class="p1">I started with cleaning the backend of my website. Think of it in the same way of staging your house to put on the market.</p>
<p class="p1">You want the charm without the personal touches:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Clean</li>
<li class="p1">Uncluttered</li>
<li class="p1">A palette for new vision without feeling sterile and uninviting</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">At this point, I was still using one of the old templates <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">from BigCommerce</a> and decided the website looked dated.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21107" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-4.png" alt="" width="640" height="330" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-4.png 1453w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-4-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-4-750x387.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I could have left it for the new owners to manage, but:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">I did not know how long it would take for me to find a buyer</li>
<li class="p1">December was a slow month in sales and the perfect time to shut down the site for maintenance</li>
<li class="p1">I could make an event out of the new site to promote sales come January 1<span class="s1">st</span>, which would look great to a prospective buyer</li>
<li class="p1">It would also help to prepare my customers to a potential change</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">When selecting a new template, I wanted something simple, where if the new owners wanted to update the logo, it wouldn’t clash with the new theme. The new theme also needed to still allow for the personality of the brand to shine through.</p>
<p class="p1">I decided to go with the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/runway-bright/">Runway Bright Stencil</a> by Pixel Union. It was cheery, fully responsive and could be easily updated if necessary.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-5.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21106" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-5.png" alt="" width="640" height="330" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-5.png 1453w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-5-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-5-750x387.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p5">2. Organizing Inventory</h3>
<p class="p1">Next, I removed all products that were not in stock. I was not going to invest in add-on items during our transition period and I did not want our site to appear empty to potential buyers or customers.</p>
<p class="p1">I also condensed our product categories.</p>
<p class="p1">Having so many categories made our website look cluttered and uninviting. Instead I re-organized and streamlined the flow.</p>
<p class="p6"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21108" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="352" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-3.png 1157w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-3-750x413.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I also updated <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/following-best-practices-product-images/">all our product images</a> and included photos of how our stamps were used on cards.</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted the inspiration for our designs to be available for not only the customer, but for the buyer as well. They weren’t just purchasing our company, they were inheriting our brand, our designs and the personality behind it.</p>
<p class="p1">They needed to be inspired –– inspired by our website, our products, reviews, social media, customers and design team.</p>
<p class="p6"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21109" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="316" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-2.png 1155w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-2-300x148.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-2-750x370.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<h3 class="p5">3. Getting Financials in Order</h3>
<p class="p1">Once I had our website updated, I started on our financials &#8211; the key first step to a favorable valuation. Not only did I update our bookkeeping records, I wanted to create a one-page quick glance reference sheet that included:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Last 3 years of sales revenue</li>
<li class="p1">% of growth per year</li>
<li class="p1">Top 10 stamps with their sales amount</li>
<li class="p1">Active wholesale accounts</li>
<li class="p1">Number of customers, orders and conversion percentage</li>
<li class="p1">Value of inventory on hand</li>
<li class="p1">Number of unique designs we owned</li>
<li class="p1">Monthly operating costs</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21111" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps.png" alt="" width="640" height="324" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps.png 1135w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-300x152.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-750x380.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Our annual industry conference was coming up in January and I wanted to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Take advantage of the opportunity and meet with potential buyers.</li>
<li class="p1">Be prepared with quick reference material and not an overwhelming amount of information.</li>
<li class="p1">Have specific information on hand my buyer would need to know for our industry.  They did not have a lot of time to dissect a report, if they were interested in more information, we would provide it later in the discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For now, a one-page report would be ideal for our situation.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Where to Find the Right Buyers</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Business calculators and formulas should be taken with a grain of salt. You need to know your industry and sell that industry vision to a buyer.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Since the conference was geared toward manufacturers and buyers and not open to the public, I could focus on gauging the interest from companies within our industry, which would become invaluable when it came to determine the actual sale price.</p>
<p class="p1">It was during the conference that I received a valuable piece of advice from another stamp company owner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">A competitor does not hold the value of your business as high as a consumer or manufacturer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Primarily, since many of my customers are their customers, my customer database brings in zero value. The designs and sentiment stamps we carry also bring in little value as there is a good chance we have overlapping or similar designs.</p>
<p class="p1">In other words, my initial asking price just took a big kick to the pants, but it also reinforced that business calculators and formulas should be taken with a grain of salt –– which is why it is so important for you to know your industry and the type of seller you want to attract.</p>
<h2 class="p4">How Various Buyers Value an Online Business</h2>
<p class="p1">For me, my top three candidates for business valuation were Manufacturer, Competitor and Consumer and each had their pros and cons, it just depended on what my needs were.</p>
<h3 class="p5">1. Manufacturer</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Sells their services to other stamp companies so their client database is made up of store owners, not consumers</li>
<li class="p1">By manufacturing and selling to the consumer, they will have a higher ROI</li>
<li class="p1">They could recoup the cost of the purchase quicker</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Biggest benefit:</strong> </em>These factors equal a more perceived value in your business and a higher sale price.</p>
<h3 class="p5">2. Competitor</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Same customer base</li>
<li class="p1">Duplicate design</li>
<li class="p1">Established website</li>
<li class="p1">Your company would integrate with theirs and your designs as a brand they offer</li>
<li class="p1">Your existing inventory is worth approximately 35% of cost</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Biggest drawback:</strong></em> Essentially, your company holds little value and would have a low sale price.</p>
<h3 class="p5">3. Consumer</h3>
<p class="p1">This is someone who is active and educated in your industry who wants to just “take over” what you have built.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Complete turnkey business is an asset</li>
<li class="p1">Website has high value</li>
<li class="p1">Customer database and social media presence has high value</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Biggest value:</strong> </em>Greater value in your business as the hard part is done and equals higher sale price.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Timing is Everything</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">You want your reputation to remain intact – which is why timing is so important.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">In most cases, you will be focused on a consumer or manufacturer, but you also need to factor in your “why.”</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Why are you selling?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you need out sooner rather than later?</li>
<li class="p1">Can you wait for the perfect buyer who can meet your asking price?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you are in dire need to sell, a competitor may be your best option.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">They have the funds to purchased</li>
<li class="p1">You won’t be required to stay on longer during transition</li>
<li class="p1">Relatively painless</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you have time and your main motivation for selling is to ensure your customers are taken care of, a manufacturer may be your best option.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">They have the funds to purchase</li>
<li class="p1">You may be asked to help during the transition</li>
<li class="p1">Your customers will be happy as their needs will be met</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Imagine if you could have walked into your dream business and instantly started to see the sales pour in: the customers, brand awareness, the hours of sleep you would enjoy, lack of stress, wouldn’t that be heaven?</p>
<p class="p1">That is what a consumer buyer will be getting.</p>
<p class="p1">They get it all. Everything you did, everything you have and everything in the pipeline has value. But…</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Do they have the funds up front?</li>
<li class="p1">Would you consider payments?</li>
<li class="p1">Would you be willing to stay and help through a transition period?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you have time to wait for a buyer to come up with funds, going for a consumer buyer could be the most lucrative. However, you want to look at your business trends.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">If business is typically slow in Q4, do you want to sell to someone who may be disappointed in the lack of profit?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you want their perception of you be tainted due to the ebb and flow of seasonality?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Regardless of whether you warned them about the slow months, you want your reputation to remain intact, not slandered.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to selling to a consumer, keep your timing in mind. In the end, you will all benefit from it.</p>
<h2 class="p4">How to Transition Profitably</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We turned the change of ownership into a fun and wonderful time, with clear direction of who was now in charge.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">First things first, I sold my business to a manufacturer. And not just any manufacturer. I sold it to the manufacturer that helped me to grow the business in the first place by providing all of the quality stamps I needed in the timeframes that I needed them.</p>
<p class="p1">It was clear they knew how to handle demand and that they made quality products. Both of those were especially important to me in selling the business. I had built trust with my audience, and I didn’t want to hand them off to a seller I wasn’t sure knew how to keep up with demand and quality in sync.</p>
<p class="p1">I sold the business to them in the first quarter of 2017. One of the key reasons I wanted to sell in the first quarter is because traditionally Q1 and Q2 are our most profitable months. The new owner could easily see a profit from their investment in the first 6 months if purchased at the right time.</p>
<p class="p1">I also scheduled specific promotions and marketing campaigns throughout the first half of the year.</p>
<p class="p1">We had new releases, anniversary celebration, month long collaborations with other companies, we sponsored events that drew in new customers and we celebrated the new owners.</p>
<p class="p1">We turned the change of ownership into a fun and wonderful time, with clear direction of who was now in charge.</p>
<p class="p1">When I asked how they felt at the end of their first month, John replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“I haven’t smiled this much in a long time.” While Vicky quickly added, “he also hasn’t seen the sun in a month.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">When selling your company, it’s about making everyone feel confident and successful.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Put together a marketing plan that they can implement</li>
<li class="p1">Offer to help them during the transition</li>
<li class="p1">Answer the questions they have</li>
<li class="p1">Give them feedback if they ask, but keep in mind this is their baby now.  They need to make the decisions that are best for them and the vision they have for their new business.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p4">How to Transition Peacefully</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Don’t sabotage the new owners by being aloof and non-existent.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Now that you have sold your business, what happens now?</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Where do you go?</li>
<li class="p1">What do you do?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If the new owners are receptive, plan an event to celebrate. First, put your customers at ease by being active on social media. Put on a happy and positive front, address them directly, introduce the new owners, tell them why you sold, if appropriate.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, you know your customers and what needs to be done to put them at ease.</p>
<p class="p1">Don’t sabotage the new owners by being aloof and non-existent. The more successful their first month is, the more valuable you become.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Learning to Let Go: Starting a New Chapter</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur and there is always another dream to grow.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">There is one aspect you can’t plan for and the one that sneaks up on you with no warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">The emotional roller coaster of letting go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The joy, relief, sadness, fear and pride. It’s very similar to watching your child graduate from high school and then move out, get married, and have a family of their own.</p>
<p class="p1">They will always be your child, but now it’s time for them to make a life for themselves. A lot of times without your opinion or consent, as much as that may frustrate you, it’s part of the process.</p>
<p class="p1">The “baby” I gave birth to, raised, nurtured and cultivated into a successful young business will always be a part of me, but for her to continue to grow, I needed to let go and move on.</p>
<p class="p1">I needed to let the new owners take her in the direction they envisioned.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s my turn to sit back, relish in my achievements and start building a new chapter in my life. Because let’s face it, once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur and there is always another dream to grow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">You don&#8217;t really know what you&#8217;re doing until you&#8217;ve lost $1M of your own money in 1 year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">In 2013, that’s exactly what happened to me and my brothers’ business, Dazadi.</p>
<p class="p1">It was the worst year on record for the then 11-year-old company, which is saying a lot. After all, we started the business in 2002, directly in the aftermath of the DotCom bubble burst.</p>
<p class="p1">Add to that the fact that my brothers and I didn&#8217;t come from a business family. I had a business degree at the time, but I had gotten that and then joined the Marines and forgot just about everything I learned while in business school.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, we built our $22,000,000 business by learning from our failures. And losing a million of our own hard earned money in 2013 was one of our biggest.</p>

<h2 class="p3">The Hard Learned Lesson That Lost Us $1,000,000</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We chased market share instead of profitability. That’s really just a nice way to say we let our ego get ahead of our gut.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">How did it happen?</p>
<p class="p1">Easy –– we chased market share instead of profitability. That’s really just a nice way to say we let our ego get ahead of our gut.</p>
<p class="p1">And why wouldn’t we have? Back then, ecommerce was so much easier.</p>
<p class="p1">When we started the company, we were only website-based. Life was great. We paid a nickel-a-click to a company called Overture, which was eventually bought by Yahoo, to drive traffic to the website.</p>
<p class="p1">Like I said, life was great. We went from $100,000 in year one, to $1,000,000 in year two, to $2,000,000 in year three.</p>
<p class="p1">It was too easy.</p>
<p class="p1">But then, we got a phone call from Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2002, eBay was a very successful online marketplace, but we could never figure it out. It was complicated and the fee structures were hard. We just went away from it, and from marketplaces as a whole.</p>
<p class="p1">But when Amazon called us in 2004, the timing and the structure were right. The model was simple. There was only one fee. We didn’t have to pay until the sale happened and we knew for a fact that Amazon got a lot more eyeballs than we did. It didn’t matter to us that at the time they were just selling books and CDs. You could see the trajectory.</p>
<p class="p1">For many years after that, Amazon was a smaller portion of our business compared to the direct traffic to Dazadi.com.</p>
<p class="p1">But it was always growing –– and business was good. <em>It was very good.</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">Unthinkable Act #1: No One Buys Table Tennis Tables in a Recession</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">What do they call it? Throwing your money at a problem? Yeah, we did that.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Then the 2008 financial crisis hit. Turns out that when half the country loses their job, they don&#8217;t need a table tennis table. They&#8217;re going to use their money to buy groceries instead.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s when we did the unthinkable.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead of focusing on profitability, we decided to expand our product offering to cover more of the market. Instead of looking at what was selling well, and doubling down there, we spread ourselves thin –– and hired a director of marketing.</p>
<p class="p1">What do they call it? Throwing your money at a problem?</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah, we did that.</p>
<p class="p1">That brings us to 2013 –– when we lost a million dollars from our bottom line.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">We were selling goods at market rate</li>
<li class="p1">Not buying them at a price to support that low price at a profit</li>
<li class="p1">Then, chasing the sale despite not making profits with the hopes that our volume would back us into lower cost of goods</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This only works when you pick good, fast-moving products, and it never works with everything.</p>
<p class="p1">And us, well, we tried it with everything.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">It was the wrong time</li>
<li class="p1">It was the wrong strategy</li>
<li class="p1">And it cost us –– big time</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">It also taught us something vitally important to every business. That is, double down in the area where your revenue is generated.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s how we came back from a $1,000,000 loss in one year.</p>
<h2 class="p3">What to Do When You’ve Lost $1,000,000</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We shut down the marketing department and went all in with marketplaces.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">What we did in the aftermath of that disastrous year is we looked at all of our SKUs. We were getting a lot of sales, but we were losing a lot of money on a lot of SKUs. So, we cut the bad SKUS and we zeroed in on what was working.</p>
<p class="p1">Ironically, what was working the best, and what we had the most control over, were a handful of items on Amazon. So, we put that under the microscope.</p>
<p class="p1">We figured out the system for profitability on Amazon, and then we expanded that system to many other SKUs. That’s how we got back to being a profitable company.</p>
<p class="p1">But once again, we had to do the unthinkable.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is the hard truth we had to sit with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;ll keep the website, but we&#8217;re not very good at it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">We were spending all of our money on marketing that wasn’t generating any sales –– whereas on Amazon, sales were rolling in.</p>
<p class="p1">And if 2013 taught us anything, it was that we had to focus on revenue –– not on perception (or desired perception).</p>
<p class="p1">So, we shut down the marketing department and went all in with marketplaces.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s when we really started winning.</p>
<p class="p1">Once we focused on where our revenue was coming from, dove in and figured out the system, our profitability skyrocketed. Then, we built out our profitability reporting and a bunch of special stuff in our ERP system.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Everything was just humming along.</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">Carefully Shifting a Profitable Model to Additional Channels</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">To do anything on OSCommerce cost money and time and resources we felt were better spent on our marketplace sales.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Except that the whole time we were winning, we knew that anything can happen on a marketplace like Amazon and that in order to really add value to Dazadi, we needed to be growing our customer base on Dazadi.com and driving more sales there.</p>
<p class="p1">And to make that happen, we really needed to shift our mentality.</p>
<p class="p1">We didn’t see ourselves as a marketing company. We had been burned. Plus, we were on OSCommerce at the time, always had been.</p>
<p class="p1">We had our own developers and development team –– and still, the platform wasn’t feature-rich enough to really win at marketing.</p>
<p class="p1">To do anything on OSCommerce cost money and time and resources we felt were better spent on our marketplace sales. So finding a new platform was the most crucial piece for us.</p>
<p class="p1">We knew that the path of getting back to driving sales and traffic to Dazadi.com was having a really good ecommerce platform.</p>
<p class="p1">And, because we had developed and iterated on an open source platform for so many years, we knew exactly what we were looking for and we knew what we needed –– and what we didn’t.</p>
<p class="p1">So, we got to work. We interviewed probably half a dozen different service providers, and figured out one important thing. Here is where we landed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">It was going to take us 5 years to get caught up with everyone else if we went with open source or custom build. We needed a platform that had everything we needed right then already built-in, and one with extensible APIs we could connect to our home grown ERP system.</p>
<p class="p1">That meant we were looking at a SaaS solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">That led us to Shopify Plus –– and doing yet another unthinkable thing.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Unthinkable Act #2: We Don’t Want a Plug-in For That</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We were clearly trying to find a platform on which we’d grow to $100,000,000, to $200,000,000, to $500,000,000 in revenue, and Shopify Plus just didn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Here’s the thing: I personally was very frustrated with my experience in communicating with Shopify. We had several meetings with them and to every question, the answer seemed to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We think we have a plug-in for that.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">So we said, OK –– and I had my team go and research all the plugins we’d need. That got us here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">If we have to identify all the plugins, and then we have to integrate those and test each individual one to make sure it works and does what we want it to do –– well, then we might as well build the platform ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">In fact, one of my most frustrating calls in which I almost hung up on them was when they didn&#8217;t understand freight. They just didn&#8217;t understand the furniture market.</p>
<p class="p1">It was a frustrating sales experience.</p>
<p class="p1">We were clearly trying to find a platform on which we’d grow to $100,000,000, to $200,000,000, to $500,000,000 in revenue, and Shopify Plus just didn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p class="p1">Turns out, BigCommerce was the only platform that had the system on which we could build out everything we needed in a very short and easy manner.</p>
<p class="p1">No one else could do it.</p>
<p class="p1">Better yet, the BigCommerce team totally got that we were trying to do. For freight, for instance, they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Oh yeah, we&#8217;ve got lots of furniture people. We know exactly what you&#8217;re talking about. We know exactly what freight is.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">For us, that’s the biggest thing. Of course everyone knows about small packages. That’s easy. Freight is not easy and the fact that BigCommerce embraced that and had the features built-in to allow us to do what we needed to do –– well, that was the selling point for me.</p>
<p class="p1">These days, internally, we call BigCommerce the “grown up platform” because it literally had every single feature built into it that we needed.</p>
<p class="p1">And, those features are built-in the grownup way. They are in there for the complex business –– businesses like us who have been on the IR 1000 list for 8 years running.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, we can finally focus on building the marketing plan that our Dazadi customers and the Dazadi company deserve.</p>
<p class="p1">So, how are we planning to do that? How are we taking these lessons and applying them to the future? Great question –- and it leads us to our next unthinkable act.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Growing to $100M and Beyond</h3></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">Unthinkable Act #3: The Decision to Give Up $2,000,000 in Revenue</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I cried myself to sleep for about a week after we cut that revenue.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">One thing we did as we began to ramp up our marketing expertise was to cut out all of our drop shippers. Doing that meant we cut out probably $2,000,000 of annual revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">I cried myself to sleep for about a week after we cut that revenue, but I think at the end of the day it makes us a stronger brand and a better company.</p>
<p class="p1">That doesn’t mean that becoming a 100% inventory business wasn’t really, really painful.</p>
<p class="p1">It very much was.</p>
<p class="p1">The reason we did it, though, is because we noticed that our performance metrics, on time delivery and order errors were significantly higher with our drop shippers than they were with our own inventory, with our own fulfillment centers.</p>
<p class="p1">We did our due diligence to work with our partners at those drop shippers for years, trying to improve those metrics and ended up finding out that they just couldn&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p class="p1">We needed to make a drastic change.</p>
<p class="p1">So, we set out to open additional fulfillment centers and end our drop shipping relationships.  Today, we have four across the country, excluding the stuff we send off to Amazon FBA.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, because we do not drop shipping anymore, we’ve significantly reduced the amount of SKUs we offer. We&#8217;re in the process of ramping that up, but doing so differently than we ever have before.</p>
<p class="p1">This time, we&#8217;re adding our own private label products and exclusive SKUs you can’t get anywhere else on the web. This means most of our now 16,000 SKUs have their own UPC codes.</p>
<p class="p1">It also means that we now have the time to look at each individual listing as an asset.</p>
<p class="p1">We are putting a lot more energy into product page SEO and optimizing each page as though it is a product page to drive increased conversions so we can add more SKU variation as we have the revenue to do so.</p>
<p class="p1">What we’ve learned is that by having much fewer SKUs, we can really give each listing its due.</p>
<p class="p1">And it’s working. As of writing, search traffic has the second highest conversion rate on the site, falling only behind campaign generated traffic.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, let’s talk about those campaigns.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Our Plan to Build a Powerhouse Marketing Organization</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I’ve had it ingrained in my head for too long that any time we have to do an integration, we have to do it ourselves. But we don’t. Not anymore.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">First things first, I’m having to unlearn years of open source constraints.</p>
<p class="p1">I still talk to my team about building out a consumer financing option and how we can integrate that into the site. And then, I talk to BigCommerce and they already have a Beta running, and other customers using it and they can tell me if it&#8217;s working –– or if it’s a waste of my time.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve had it ingrained in my head for too long that any time we have to do an integration, we have to do it ourselves.</p>
<p class="p1">But we don’t. Not anymore.</p>
<p class="p1">So, this is where we are starting in our marketing and our campaigns –– not on building integrations, but on installing apps and services and moving forward with our plans.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Optimizing for Conversion</h3>
<p class="p1">Beyond optimizing for SEO by providing better product pages (and better quality products), we’ve also integrated with an optimizer.</p>
<p class="p1">With it, we&#8217;re looking at all of our different pages and finding out which ones have the highest bounce rate. Then, we’re iterating on them and doing some A/B testing to improve the performance and the conversion rates on those pages and across the board.</p>
<p class="p1">This is an area where BigCommerce is ahead of the game, in my opinion, by offering a  one-page checkout. The experience is so clean –– and the integration with Amazon Pay will work to help convert our former Amazon customers to webstore customers (as well as anyone else who uses Amazon, which everyone does).</p>
<p class="p1">That’s an integration I haven&#8217;t had anything to do with. It is just there. Ready for me and anyone else on the platform to use.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s on the checkout page where consumer financing will be live, too. Even there, we have options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/klarna/">Klarna</a></li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/paypal/">PayPal</a></li>
<li class="p1">AfterPay</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Those solutions speak to different audiences, and as we look to move international, will help us to optimize for conversions across locations.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Laser Targeting Consumers on Facebook and Google</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I remember the glory days of Google AdWords, where it was a nickel-a-click.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Like I mentioned earlier, our campaign driven traffic is our highest converting on the site (year to date).</p>
<p class="p1">That’s because we have been looking at Facebook audiences and building audiences from people who&#8217;ve bought from us in the past and who like our products.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re beginning to drive traffic to specific landing pages that are optimized and ready for those ad campaigns and retargeting as well. We’ll do the same thing with Google AdWords.</p>
<p class="p1">All signs are pointing to the fact that this is really going to work.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, we identified 22,000 customers from our <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/ecommerce-analytics/">BigCommerce Analytics</a> that bought products from us last year. And we were able to find 17,000 of those on Facebook to create an audience.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s all really exciting.</p>
<p class="p1">I remember the glory days of Google AdWords, where it was a nickel-a-click. I also remember when it became $5-a-click and you couldn&#8217;t make money anymore. It was kind of throwing mud on a wall to see what stuck and you really couldn&#8217;t narrow in.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, with Facebook audiences and what you can do in Google, you aren’t throwing mud on a wall. Instead, they’ve given you a pinpoint laser where we can really go right to the customer who&#8217;s bought from us and likes our stuff and make them different offerings to bring them back.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s amazing how sophisticated things have gotten.</p>
<p class="p1">I got a friend who is an infomercial legend in Seattle. He’s been doing this sort of thing on television for a long time with all their Nielsen data. It&#8217;s nice to see that digital is caught up, and taking that to the next level to laser focus in on an exact customer.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Email Marketing to Customer Cohorts</h3>
<p class="p1">Email marketing is another big area we’re focusing on. I&#8217;m embarrassed to say that we didn&#8217;t do a lot of email marketing last year, but we&#8217;re changing that this year.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re looking at gathering more data about our customers when they come to the site and segmenting those lists in a way that we were never able to do before.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, we’ll drive them to optimized landing pages, which are on the BigCommerce platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that we feel we are best-in-class in our category, it&#8217;s really exciting to be able to focus on driving more traffic to our site and going after and learning these new and much more sophisticated ways to drive sales.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s really exciting time for me. I love learning, so this has been a nice journey.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We are going to win. I know that now.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">We are going to win. I know that now. That’s what this whole journey has been about –– removing the fear of failure. It was a steep learning curve. We’ve both lost millions and made millions, and we’ve come out the other end smarter and stronger for every moment.</p>
<p class="p1">That is what I’m most proud of, that we haven’t been deterred when we’ve failed. We just keep carrying on. We put things out in the wild and see how it works. We adjust. We learn. And we continue to build our family business.</p>

Hmm… let’s ask the <a href="https://adwords.googleblog.com/2016/05/ways-to-be-useful-for-mobile-shoppers.html">VP of Google Shopping</a>:</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Whether they’re looking for a new sofa or the perfect pair of earrings, people who search and shop on their smartphones at least once a week say that product images are the shopping feature they turn to most.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Jonathan Alferness, Vice President, Product Management, Google Shopping Inside AdWords, May 2016</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">When you’re shopping online, product images are the closest you can get to an in-store experience; zooming in and looking at alternate angles is the digital replacement for holding it in your hands or trying it on.</p>
<p class="p1">Photos are how shoppers judge fit, quality, and overall desirability of your product — and your brand. The care you put into your imagery reflects the care you put into your business and your credibility as a seller.</p>
<p class="p1">At <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/">Pixelz</a>, we’ve edited more than 15 million images for more than 10,000 retailers, brands, and photo studios around the world. In working with everyone from multi-brand fashion groups, startup marketplaces, mobile apps, and name brands like <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/case-studies-express/">Express</a> and <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/case-studies-arcteryx/">Arc’teryx</a>, to DIY entrepreneurs launching businesses from home, we’ve learned that the biggest barrier to high quality product images isn’t budget — it’s knowledge.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">The biggest barrier to high quality product images isn’t budget — it’s knowledge.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Many budding entrepreneurs are intimidated by the technical aspects of product photography and wary of the hefty price tags they seen thrown around: $5k/day for a model, $10k camera lenses, $1500 studio rentals, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">Don’t be.</p>
<p class="p1">In a world where the average person is already walking around with a 12-Megapixel camera in their pocket, and where the most powerful image editing software ever created is only $10 a month, product photography doesn’t have to break your bank.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re writing this guide with BigCommerce to demystify product photography and post-production for everyone. High quality images are within your reach, with just a little bit of reading and planning.</p>
<p class="p1">In this guide we’ll cover topics like:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">How to build your own ecommerce photo studio</li>
<li class="p1">How to use your smartphone for product photography</li>
<li class="p1">What kind of lights to use (when and why)</li>
<li class="p1">How to add shadows to product images for a more professional look</li>
<li class="p1">How to photograph reflective products</li>
<li class="p1">How to create ghost mannequin images</li>
<li class="p1">Alternatives to white backgrounds (and when to use them)</li>
<li class="p1">The importance of retouching –– and some best practices you need to know (or else Twitter may take your brand down!)</li>
</ol>

<p class="p1">Bounce Exchange is the <a href="https://www.inc.com/tess-townsend/inc5000-2016-new-york-bounce-exchange.html">7th fastest growing business in the U.S</a>.

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">After analyzing billions of impressions, with the people-based approach to landing page optimization, BounceX has found that brands see a 10-15% lift in conversion rate, on average.</p>
<p class="p1">Those findings have been critical to how BounceX has grown over the last few years – earning it the <a href="https://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2016">position #7 on the Inc. 5000 list</a> of 2016.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is exactly how we thought through it, and how ecommerce brands can work to see similar success.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Don’t judge a book by its cover”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">A short piece of wisdom we have all heard and, most likely, are all guilty of doing anyway.</p>
<p class="p1">But don’t feel too bad, because, apparently, we can’t actually help it.</p>
<p class="p1">As humans, we are <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-in-world/201208/judging-book-its-cover">predominantly visual creatures</a>, meaning that “wrappers in which things come not only powerfully affect what interests us but also how we react to the contents we find inside.”</p>
<p class="p1">We can’t help but judge books by their covers, food by its appearance, and, most importantly, brands by their landing pages.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, ecommerce landing pages represent a very neglected but increasingly crucial brand wrapper &#8212; a key initial impression and touchpoint for many new shoppers.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Landing pages are a neglected but increasingly crucial brand wrapper &#8211; a key initial impression and touchpoint for many new shoppers.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">And even for those returning ones, ecommerce landing pages can play an important role in motivating traffic to continue engaging with your brand and ultimately convincing them to make a purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Even more unfortunate is the fact that while brands today spend large portions of their marketing budget driving traffic to their digital storefronts, that paid traffic rarely reaches its full potential — as evidenced by subpar conversion rates. That untapped value is a consequence of disjointed onsite experiences coupled with the simple truth that consumers judge brands based on their preliminary experiences, abandoning them in response.</p>
<p class="p1">So, considering these two factors:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">The key role that initial landing page impression can play in the consumer journey</li>
<li class="p1">The painful fact that, as long as that traffic isn’t purchasing, you are likely going to have to pay for them again and again until they do</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Why not do everything you in your power to ensure that your landing page experiences are as seamless (and as revenue-driving) as possible?</p>
<p class="p1">This blog post will walk you through why landing pages are becoming increasingly important to positive and profitable ecommerce customer experiences in addition to explaining what you can do to optimize the value of yours –– right now.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>14,575% Growth in 3 Years</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Get the insider tricks of the landing page trade from Bounce Exchange, the landing page business that grew 14,757% in just 3 years.  <a href="http://convert.bouncex.com/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-landing-page-webinar.html?utm_source=bigcommerce&amp;utm_medium=registrationform&amp;utm_campaign=partnerwebinar">Sign up for the webinar “The Anatomy of a Perfect Landing Page”</a> on Tuesday May 2.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">What is a Landing Page?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A landing page is a standalone webpage targeted to a specific cohort of your traffic, with the aim of providing a more relevant experience in order to achieve the ultimate objective of driving that cohort toward conversion</span><b>.</b></p>
<p class="p1">According to Wikipedia, a landing page can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page">defined</a> as a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“single page that appears in response to clicking on a search result or online advertisement.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The definition and application varies from organization to organization. </span></p>
<p class="p1">The real and long-term goal of landing pages, as I see it however, is one that Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos envisioned back in 1999:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“We have 6.2 million customers, we should have 6.2 million storefronts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">In other words, because every customer is unique and requires different types of attention and engagement to be convinced to purchase, businesses should adapt accordingly by <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-personalization/">tailoring their stores to each of those individual customers</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Enter landing pages.</p>
<p class="p1">While retailers can’t be expected to actually create unique websites for every user, they can create unique digital storefronts. Landing pages represent the tool through which brands can adapt to the user in question, creating relevant and positive-impression making experiences for each of the individuals engaging with your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Think <a href="https://think.bouncex.com/article/what-is-people-based-marketing/">People-Based Marketing</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Sure, it is a marketing buzzword, but it is a buzzword for a reason. By taking a customer-first approach to your landing page optimization strategy, you will do more than create impactful landing pages that guide your traffic in the precise direction you want them to go. You will simultaneously unlock incremental value from each of those individuals, driving higher returns for your business as a result.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Put These Steps Into Action</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Do you have questions about landing pages? <a href="http://convert.bouncex.com/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-landing-page-webinar.html?utm_source=bigcommerce&amp;utm_medium=registrationform&amp;utm_campaign=partnerwebinar">Sign up for our webinar “The Anatomy of a Perfect Landing Page”</a> co-hosted by BounceX and BigCommerce. It’s on Tuesday May 2, at 2PM EST. By the end of it you will be a People-Based, Landing Page pro with more revenue filling out your bottom line.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">People-Based Landing Pages: You <em>almost</em> already have them</h2>
<p class="p1">So, naturally, you want to board the landing page train as soon as possible. But the fact of the matter is that you already sort of have.</p>
<p class="p1">Every page on your website that a customer lands on is, in effect, a landing page.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your homepage</li>
<li class="p1">Your category pages</li>
<li class="p1">Your product pages</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">These all represent a place where an individual can enter your website. They just are not people-based landing pages &#8212; not yet, anyway.</p>
<p class="p1">In the past, consumer journeys online have been completely linear. Every time a user wanted to engage with your brand, they had to begin with the homepage, navigate to a category page, and then to a product page, building their conversion momentum as they moved deeper into the website.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result, nearly every consumer journey began with an introduction (or a reintroduction) to the brand itself. Just read any post or guide about <a href="http://www.pixus.uk/blog/importance-good-homepage/">homepage optimization</a>.  It will tell you that “the homepage serves as the first impression for a new visitor and generally it will be the page that receives the most traffic.”</p>
<p class="p1">But this is just not always true any more.</p>
<p class="p1">If you take a quick look into your website analytics, you will likely notice that a few product pages rank near the top or even above the homepage.</p>
<p class="p1">This stems from the fact that consumer journeys today have changed dramatically. They are no longer linear. Instead, they have become increasingly fragmented and will only continue to become more so as more channels and new points of brand engagement become available.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20752" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="279" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-2.jpg 900w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-2-300x131.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-2-750x327.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<h2 class="p3">4 Steps to Implementing a People-Based Landing Page Strategy</h2>
<p class="p1">Today, shoppers can arrive at your ecommerce site through a plethora of unique channels after engaging through any number of different messages or searching for any given term or product.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">They might click through a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/facebook/sell-shoes/">Facebook ad for shoes</a>, landing on your website in the shoes category</li>
<li class="p1">Or, they might click through a marketing email that takes them directly to a specific product page</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">They can also land on any page type at any given moment during any point in their conversion journey.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">That Facebook user may have been targeted with a Lookalike ad, landing on that site for the very first time</li>
<li class="p1">Whereas that email user could have received a product recommendation email after making a first purchase</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In other words, two very different types of shoppers &#8212; a new prospect and a returning customer &#8212; can have the exact same brand experience.</p>
<p class="p1">Not ideal.</p>
<p class="p1">Consequently, the brand impression and value illustrated on the homepage is often lost to these shoppers entering the website from Product Listing Ads, AdWords, cart abandonment ads, category sale emails, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">They are simply dropped off on any page of the website, left to either convert or not convert.</p>
<p class="p1">So while you do have landing pages &#8212; they are not yet optimized for a revenue-driving and People-Based strategy. But we promise to get you on board the people-based landing page train.</p>
<p class="p1">Just follow the below four steps.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Step 1: Create undeniable value on every page</h3>
<p class="p1">In a world where every consumer has an infinite number of options for nearly any given product at their fingertips &#8212; where <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenkusek/2016/07/25/the-death-of-brand-loyalty-cultural-shifts-mean-its-gone-forever/#def64354ddec">Forbes</a> whispers of the death of loyalty &#8212; ensuring that your visitors understand why they should buy from your brand is crucial.</p>
<p class="p1">Unfortunately, that undeniable value that sets your brand apart from the rest is very rarely clear outside of the homepage or the About Us page.</p>
<p class="p1">Just look at this standard product landing page template that almost every ecommerce retailer uses.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20753" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png 1025w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1-300x195.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1-750x487.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><em>Note: This is not a BigCommerce site. You can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">view all of BigCommerce&#8217;s optimized themes, templates and landing pages here</a>. Industry leaders like <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/ecommerce/bigcommerce">Theme Forest have also designed optimized themes for BigCommerce customers</a>. </em></p>
<p class="p1">The problem here isn’t actually with the template, but with what most ecommerce retailers do (or don’t do) with that template.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about the new visitor engaging with a Facebook Lookalike product ad for sandals.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">She clicks through the ad and lands directly on a product page that probably looks similar to the templated one above.</li>
<li class="p1">She sees the sandals, they’re cute, but she could probably get similar ones on Amazon for a cheaper price.</li>
<li class="p1">And finally, she clicks back and continues browsing Facebook.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">What wasn’t clear to this new user when she landed on the product page was all the details that would have likely motivated her to engage further:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">an expiring promotion on sandals or free shipping, returns, and exchanges</li>
<li class="p1">or the fact that for every pair purchased, another pair is donated to a woman in need</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In other words, since the home page is no longer the sole landing page, it is up to you to ensure every page on your website resonates with value.</p>
<p class="p1">And why shouldn’t it?</p>
<p class="p1">Most retailers have specific value propositions &#8212; whether <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/value-based-ecommerce-pricing-strategy/">price</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/create-a-returns-and-exchanges-policy-that-sells/">return policy</a>, brand story, or social responsibility. Those elements are a part of your business for a reason, why not share them with your consumers, especially if they will drive value for your business in return.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few examples of product pages that include valuable information typically on Homepage or About Us pages –– and how these retailers weave in those storylines.</p>

<h3 class="p6">Step 2: Make it easy</h3>
<p class="p1">We’ll be hosting an in-depth webinar about “<a href="http://convert.bounceexchange.com/the-anatomy-of-a-perfect-landing-page-webinar.html?utm_source=bigcommerce&amp;utm_medium=partner-referral&amp;utm_campaign=anatomy-lp">The Anatomy of a Perfect Landing Page</a>” next Tuesday May 2nd at 2PM EST, but for the sake of this post, what it really boils down to is the <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/great-websites-pass-the-3-second-rule/">3-Second Rule</a>, or the theory that you have roughly 3 seconds the capture a visitor’s attention.</p>
<p class="p1">Otherwise, they’re gonezo.</p>
<p class="p1">So, with this in mind, it is crucial to ensure that on every landing page, a consumer can answer the following questions within 3 seconds:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Who you are and what do you do</li>
<li class="p1">Why you are of value or of interest to them</li>
<li class="p1">What they should do next</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Let’s look back at that templated product page we saw earlier.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20753" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1.png 1025w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1-300x195.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-1-750x487.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><em>Note: This is not a BigCommerce site. You can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">view all of BigCommerce&#8217;s optimized themes, templates and landing pages here</a>. Industry leaders like <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/ecommerce/bigcommerce">Theme Forest have also designed optimized themes for BigCommerce customers</a>. </em></p>
<p class="p1">Now, step back, close your eyes, and open them for 3-seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">Can you answer the above three questions?  I can’t &#8212; and not just because this is a templated page.</p>
<p class="p1">Per Step 1, we are already working on ensuring who you are and your value is reflected across every page.</p>
<p class="p1">But what about what they should do next?</p>
<p class="p1">In the above image, that next step is lost in plethora of page distractions. Even the add to cart button is barely visible at the bottom of the page. This type of convoluted landing page design is not conducive to seamlessly making a purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">My eyes even have to move down the page to see the discounted price, and the discount itself is tiny!  Additionally, while the product image is large and clear, I don’t really understand the associated labels. If it’s “HOT” because of the price, shouldn’t that great discount be reflected prominently?</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to making the purchase decision, consumers are flooded with hesitations:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Do I really need it?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it too expensive?</li>
<li class="p1">Could I find it cheaper?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it worth the investment?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">It is up to the landing page to alleviate those hesitations.</p>
<p class="p1">On product pages, this means <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-rock-product-photography-on-a-budget/">ensuring clear product images</a> along with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-ctas/">prominent CTAs</a> and easily understood value propositions.</p>
<p class="p1">On category pages, this means making sure your product images are clear as shoppers scroll through in addition to ensuring customers understand the product offerings.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20751" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-3.png 1326w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-3-300x157.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-3-750x392.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In this example, while scrolling through the category page, a few things are immediately clear:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Value:</strong> Free Sample &amp; Free Shipping and Returns</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product:</strong> Large, clear product images</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product Options:</strong> the “more shades” tags give interested users another reason to click</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Next Step:</strong> persistent “Add to Bag CTA”</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The brand took the idea of motivating the user to take action to the next step. By creating the “Add to Bag” CTA button, they have simplified the checkout process, giving users the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/buy-buttons/">ability to easily add items to their cart</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Ultimately, every ecommerce landing page (and really every page of your website) should be created with the goal of getting your user to take the next-most productive step.</p>
<p class="p1">Once a user has made it to a category or product page, they have essentially told you what they are interested in. It’s up to you and your pages to ensure they are.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Step 3: Identify the right traffic</h3>
<p class="p1">Now that you’ve optimized the general landing page experience across your website, it’s time to take it one step further &#8212; the people-based way.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, it is neither feasible nor wise to try to create people-based landing page experiences for every individual arriving at your website.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, you should focus on the highest-value cohorts of your traffic. These are not only the ones you have invested your budget toward, but they are also the individuals you know you can motivate to take productive action with your business.</p>
<p class="p1">But, how do you identify the right traffic?</p>
<p class="p1">Start by diving into your website analytics, specifically looking into your top traffic sources, not only from a traffic volume perspective but also from a revenue perspective. These sources typically include Email, Paid Search, Organic Search, and Direct, to name a few.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-12.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20757" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-12.png" alt="" width="640" height="483" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-12.png 985w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-12-300x226.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-12-750x566.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Once you have pinpointed those top traffic sources, dig even deeper and look at the specific campaigns responsible.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Do those jumps in traffic arise from specific marketing emails or promotions?</li>
<li class="p1">Are they a result of <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">cart abandonment ads on Facebook</a>?</li>
<li class="p1">Are there specific search terms you have ads for that are just killing it for you?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">By sifting through all of these details, you’ll be able to get a clear understanding of which specific cohorts of traffic are the most valuable to your business.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are using an analytics solution like BigCommerce’s Insights, you can easily see reports that take this a step further. Here is a taste.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Marketing Insights Reports</h3>
<p class="p1">In this section, you can dive into customer lifetime value by channel on day 1, 90 and 180. This will help you understand which channels (AdWords, Email, Facebook, etc.) drive the highest lifelong loyalty and repeat purchase rates.</p>
<p class="p1">What is this helpful for? Understanding where to put your ad dollars to drive consumers back to your product landing pages for purchase.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-10.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20755" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-10.png" alt="" width="640" height="206" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-10.png 1118w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-10-300x97.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-10-750x242.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are the three reports you get.</em></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-9.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20745" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-9.png" alt="" width="640" height="375" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-9.png 1121w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-9-300x176.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-9-750x440.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Here is what the 90 day report looks like, and how you can download the data to further investigate.</em></p>
<h3 class="p1">Product Insights Reports</h3>
<p class="p1">Here, you can dive into which products (and subsequently product landing pages) are performing the best, and which need a little work. This data is pulled based on individual product conversion rate data. So, if its a rockstar product, it is likely a rockstar landing page.</p>
<p class="p1">Further, you can use this data with the Marketing Insights data to understand which products to market for the highest return on ad spend.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-11.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20756" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-11.png" alt="" width="640" height="419" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-11.png 1132w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-11-300x196.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-11-750x491.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Moreover, you can use these insights to see which products are bought together most often. This is a good indicator of what additional products to include on landing pages for upsell opportunities.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Customer Insights Reports</h3>
<p class="p1">With these reports, you can dive into various customer cohorts including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Best customers</li>
<li class="p1">Customers at risk</li>
<li class="p1">Low AOV customers</li>
<li class="p1">Customer lifetime value (30, 90, and 180 days)</li>
<li class="p1">Customer lifetime value by product (day 1, 90 and 180)</li>
<li class="p1">Best products for repeat purchase (By month)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This data is helpful for understanding customer behavior on your site, which products drive loyalty and creating landing pages that best attract high AOV and full-price customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Most useful, however, is to use this data for <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-ads-tips/">retargeting on Facebook</a> to earn more “Best customers” using already known characteristics of that cohort.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the full reports you have access to:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-8.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20746" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-8.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-8.png 1164w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-8-300x190.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-8-750x476.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-7.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20747" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-7.png" alt="" width="640" height="413" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-7.png 1146w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-7-300x194.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-landing-pages-7-750x484.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p6">Step 4: Behavioral Marketing</h3>
<p class="p1">Now that you have optimized landing pages and you know who to target, it’s time to bring your landing pages to life, so they can adapt to the specific person in question.</p>
<p class="p1">When any visitor lands on your website, you should be able to detect a couple of things with the proper tagging and a behavioral marketing partner like <a href="https://www.bouncex.com/">BounceX</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">If it’s her first time onsite</li>
<li class="p1">If she came through an ad and what type</li>
<li class="p1">Which ad specifically and the content of that ad</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Since you’ve already identified your most valuable traffic-driving campaigns, you can target the individuals who come through those experiences with behavioral marketing tactics.</p>
<p class="p1">So now, when that new user clicks through your Facebook Lookalike ad and lands on your sandals product page for the first time, two things will occur simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">She’ll likely remain onsite longer because your unique value propositions are clear</li>
<li class="p1">She’ll understand that the sandals are on sale for a limited time only</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Both of these are a result of your on page optimizations. With behavioral marketing, you can add a third element to the optimization process.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s the scenario:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Knowing this shopper is a new prospect who has never purchased from you before, you know she’s going to need slightly more convincing before she agrees to purchase from you and likely won’t make the purchase in her first visit.  </em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So, as she’s clicking through the product images and demonstrating clear interest, you respond to her behavior by offering her ‘Free Shipping’ when she enters her email address.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Now, you’ve not only captured her information in case she abandons but you’ve also given her another reason to buy from you today. It’s people-based marketing, people.</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">Every page on your website is effectively a landing page. And what is a landing page but your chance to make conversion-driving impressions on your valuable visitors?</p>
<p class="p1">So, to put it simply, make sure every page on your website does just that &#8211; instills real interest in each of the consumers arriving at your website (and interest they won’t find on any other ecommerce website). Between refined landing page optimization and some of the best practices listed above, you can vastly improve the value instilled in your visitors.</p>
<p class="p1">From there, get the most value from your landing pages experiences with behavioral marketing and guide your shoppers closer to conversion with every step.</p>

It&#8217;s not your name. It isn’t some meaningless press release out to the world. It&#8217;s more than a strategy laid out in a Google doc.  In fact, branding cannot be seen.</p>
<p class="p1">Branding can only be felt.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about the most amazing companies you have ever interacted with.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Where does that excitement to try on the latest collections <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/flash-tattoos/">Flash Tattoos</a> come from?</li>
<li class="p1">Why do Apple products alleviate stress and allow for a state of delighted bliss?</li>
<li class="p1">What makes you engage with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/rei-optoutside-campaign-bucks-tradition/">REI’s #OptOutside campaign</a> on Twitter, and like, nothing else?</li>
<li class="p1">How is it that you open every. single. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/man-crates/">Man Crates</a> email they send you, even though no giftable holidays are coming up?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is branding. This is business mixed with emotion and engagement and expectation. This is mission and customer participation mixed into one. It encompasses your web presence, communications, and products. It&#8217;s baked into your product details, customer emails, and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-checkout-page-optimization/">shopping cart checkout page</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the difference between brands who “get it” and those which don’t.</p>
<p class="p1">Great branding is the most powerful currency a company can have — your single-greatest competitive advantage. People purchase products because of a story, an emotional connection they feel with a brand.</p>
<p class="p1">As ecommerce owners and managers, building a powerful and engaging brand is our most important work. It is a KPI that cannot be put to paper –– but do it right, and every single goal will be surpassed.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">And yet, so few brands invest early and often in their branding strategy. In fact, it is often an afterthought of success. Something brands get to when they have enough money and time. But you don’t get the opportunity to make a first impression multiple times. How you present your brand across the web matters –– and it matters from day 1.</p>
<p class="p1">The following best practices are going to sound obvious, but it is exactly the obvious that so many *do not* do. So, beyond the typical best practices, I’ll walk you through specific brand examples that stand out above and beyond the crowd.</p>
<p class="p1">This is how you win customers and beat out the overwhelming competition on the web, whether you are just getting started or about to re-brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s dive in.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>RSVP for the Ecommerce Growth Summit</h3></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">1. Better serve your customer</h2>
<p class="p1">Always consider who your business is being built for. Remembering the wants and needs of the consumer will dictate your actions as a company and set you on the path of success with your audience.</p>
<p class="p1">If you&#8217;re unsure about who your audience is, you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p class="p1">All too often, many brands forget their audiences and focus on the product or the catalog, potentially missing out on valuable information that can increase sales.</p>
<p class="p1">This can be remedied.</p>
<p class="p1">Take the time to truly reflect on your past purchasers. Look for trends in the analytics and reflect on experiences you&#8217;ve had with your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Your analytics can be very helpful directionally in helping you understand your customer and their relation to your product and brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Looking at your store’s overview data, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">including abandoned cart data</a>, purchase funnel and most popular products is a great place to start.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20714" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc.png" alt="ecommerce branding" width="640" height="401" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc.png 1126w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc-300x188.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc-750x470.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">However, it’s helpful to dive into your customer data even further to really understand their behavior and who they are, enabling you to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/personalized-marketing/">personalize their experience</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Insights-Report">BigCommerce Insights</a> can help you to do this, though other ecommerce analytics platforms may be helpful as well.</p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce Insights cohorts customers for you automatically. You can then export these lists to market specifically to them or to drill down even further into exactly who falls into these categories, what they’ve bought, etc. This segmentation is truly the key to unlocking the potential of your ecommerce brand.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Bohemian Traders Uses BigCommerce Insights to Drive 166% Growth</h3></p>
<p class="p1">“We use BigCommerce Insights quite heavily on a day-to-day basis. In fact, it was a key motivator for us going with BigCommerce over Shopify,” says <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/bohemian-traders/">David Berlach, CEO of Bohemian Traders</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">The Customer cohorts include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Best customers</li>
<li class="p1">Customers at risk</li>
<li class="p1">Viewed by didn’t purchase (both the customer who viewed and the items they didn’t purchase)</li>
<li class="p1">Repeat purchase rate by 30, 60, 90 and 180 days (i.e. 11% of your new customers from December purchased again in 60 days. 3.39% of your new customers from January 2017 purchased again in 30 days, and so on)</li>
<li class="p1">Best full-price customers</li>
<li class="p1">Low AOV customers</li>
<li class="p1">Customer Lifetime Value by 30, 90 and 180 days</li>
<li class="p1">Customer lifetime value by product purchase by day 1, 30, 90 and 180</li>
<li class="p1">Best products for repeat purchase</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In this instance, I want to know which of my customers are sticking around the longest, and which products are helping them to do that. To see that, let’s take a quick look at Best Product for Repeat Purchase.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20672" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="397" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-1.png 1120w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-1-750x465.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>This is the cohort view for those who purchased in December, and again by March.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20673" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights.png" alt="" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights.png 1135w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-300x180.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>This is the cohort view for those who purchased in January, and again by March.</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What can this data tell you about your customers and your brand?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it that customers buy with you again at the 90 day mark?</li>
<li class="p1">Or, are your customers most often gift-buyers, meaning they drop off in January and don’t repurchase until the next major holiday (maybe Mother’s Day or Father’s Day)?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Those are questions only you can answer, and often, you will need more data to do so. But these analytics point you in the right direction and get you asking the correct questions so you can better serve your customers, increase your revenue and develop your ecommerce brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Use these to look for patterns that clearly point to the heart of your business, that is, why people buy your products.</p>
<p class="p1">Take these buying behaviors and their demographics and reverse engineer your ideal customer.</p>
<h2 class="p3">2. Share your story</h2>
<p class="p1">Tales have been told throughout the history of mankind. As people, we are better suited to remember and emotionally connect with others through storytelling than any other medium.</p>
<p class="p1">You must tell the story of your brand, and you must tell it in a way that builds trust with prospective customers and allows them a glimpse into the oft hidden life of your business.</p>
<p class="p1">So, tell your start-up story!</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Why do you exist? Seriously, why are you even in business?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">There are hundreds of thousands of online businesses. Why should someone choose to give you their money?</p>
<p class="p1">Those are serious questions –– and every single new customer on your ecommerce site is going to be asking them. Sure, some products may make them fall in love and win their conversion long before they care about who you are, but for the most part, customers want to know you. Just like you want to know them.</p>
<p class="p1">So, tell them!</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Call out why you started the business</li>
<li class="p1">Who you are</li>
<li class="p1">What you care about</li>
<li class="p1">What you stand for</li>
<li class="p1">Why you stand for it</li>
<li class="p1">Anything else that matters</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Here are a few good examples of brand storytelling in action:</p>

<h2 class="p3">3. Champion change</h2>
<p class="p1">What does your company stand for? Every brand is built around a certain set of ideals. Convey these to the world. Customers should understand your brand promise – and why it matters.</p>
<p class="p1">Build a following of faithful fans dedicated your cause. People will join in the fight when they find a vision which matches their own and will associate your company with the efforts of hope.</p>
<p class="p1">Be sure to champion this change not just on your About Us page, but absolutely everywhere. This is part of your brand.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">4. Extreme expectations</h2>
<p class="p1">Never over-promise on your company. People absolutely hate disappointment. You do not want your ecommerce branding to be associated with false promises.</p>
<p class="p1">Creating an untenable situation where you promise more than you can always deliver will alienate your audience and destroy the trust you worked so ardently to attain.</p>
<p class="p1">This is most noticeable in return and shipping policies. Here, be honest and forthright about your capabilities. You might not be able to do Amazon-like speed, but honesty will take you much further than a negative review.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, your return and shipping policies don’t need to be fancy. They just need to be clear and honest.</p>

<h2 class="p3">5. Define your market, and focus exclusively on them</h2>
<p class="p1">This is possibly the most powerful of all pieces of branding. By tailoring your solution, messaging and marketing to your customer, you instantly eliminate the hassle and heartache of pleasing all.</p>
<p class="p1">This means, again, that you need to define your market and then speak to that market in a way that resonates with them. Develop your brand persona and understand <em>who</em> they are — and are not.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/target-market-analysis/">Not everyone is your target market</a>, and not everyone needs to like your messaging. It is important only that it resonates with your target audience.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a couple of examples.</p>
<h3 class="p6"><a href="https://www.ninelineapparel.com/">Nine Line’s</a> Patriotic Stance</h3>
<p class="p1">First things first, to pull off a great brand, you need to honestly believe in that brand and likely live that lifestyle yourself. Nine Line is a great example of this. The founder is a veteran, hires veterans and speak directly to veterans and other folks who identify as patriotic. The brand awareness practically takes care of itself with such a defined audience.</p>

<p class="p1">The key to great branding is knowing how your customers view you compared to the competition. This is more commonly known as positioning.</p>
<p class="p1">From there, you can create a value statement that demonstrates how you are different.</p>
<p class="p1">A simple formula you can use is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I help (target audience) solve (burning pain) by (your solution).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">For example, my agency&#8217;s statement is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I help ecommerce entrepreneurs connect with influencers so they can rapidly grow their business together.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">Branding is not about a fancy logo or colors. It is actually what people think after seeing or interacting with your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">In order to drive a positive perception about your brand, you need to focus on driving in consistent benefits in pre-purchase marketing and over-deliver on customer experience.</p>
<p class="p1">This will enable you build a core customer base of raving fans for your brand.</p>

<p class="p1">Be consistent. An ecommerce site should be built in accordance with a brand’s brand standards guide. If a brand doesn’t have one, that’s the first place they should start.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not just the site colors and the logo, either.</p>
<p class="p1">Brands must be consistent in the tone of their copy and the overall user experience of the site. For example, if a brand touts its customer service in its messaging, a thousand word dissertation as a return policy for the site isn’t consistent with that.</p>

<p class="p1">With so many ecommerce brands out there offering similar or identical products, customers have increasing expectations. A brand with a strong ‘why’ provides consumers something to believe in. A by-product of belief is loyalty from customers, which gives you the competitive edge.</p>
<p class="p1">Branding isn’t just about an identity or logo &#8211; it’s your marketing messages, your tone-of-voice, how you present yourselves, how you deliver and respond to your customers, and much more. It is the mental picture your customers visualise of your company and whether or not it resonates with them.</p>
<p class="p1">From our experience, the No.1 peice of advice for ecommerce businesses in regards to branding is to ‘stay true’.</p>
<p class="p1">You will have this brand (hopefully) for many, many years. You can evolve, scale, innovate and harness new technology, but staying true with what you stand for as a brand will support your internal vision and external perceptions, increase customer following and loyalty, and help make the right decisions much quicker.</p>

<p class="p1">A brand is a wonderful cocktail of your reputation mixed with the gut feel someone has about your company, products or even its founders. To shape your brand, it means focusing not on just information, but appealing to site visitors emotions.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are two tools to shape how people think about you are Meaning and Story:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Is there something meaningful you can express?</li>
<li class="p1">Is there a backstory or an aspirational feeling you can provide quickly that will wrap your offering in an aura much larger than a simple ecommerce transaction?</li>

<p class="p1">Visual Identity is one of the most important aspects of the front-facing commerce business. Without clear direction on visual styling, typography, font selection, or color use, the brand begins to create confusion without even realizing it.</p>
<p class="p1">Leverage an expert in this process, as design and branding are tightly wound with psychology. Understanding the target demographic, as well as customer intention, can help focus designers on creating memorable visual experiences; and that recognition can last a lifetime.</p>

<p class="p1">Create an experience. Millennials are more brand loyal than you think, but they expect more than just advertising to keep their interest. If you can’t provide value outside of your product offering, you won’t keep their attention.</p>
<p class="p1">Drive engagement with content that adds value to their day and supports the lifestyle your brand represents. Video/UGC/tutorials/lifestyle articles –– it all add value and support your brand’s image.</p>
<p class="p1">Keeping the attention and subsequently, the conversions, of the largest consumer group is no longer just “nice to have,” it is a necessity if brands are going to compete.</p>

<p class="p1">And do that again, and again and again. That’s how you’ll stay ahead.</p>

<p class="p1">Brand names are not &#8220;established&#8221; in a day. It requires a lot of strategic marketing and promotions, before the brand name becomes recognized.</p>
<p class="p1">Ecommerce businesses should not leave out any avenue for promoting their brand. Social media is a very strong avenue these days to make or break a brand. Promote your products on the social, keep your target audience &#8220;engaged&#8221; and follow up sales with strong customer support.</p>
<p class="p1">The brand becomes bigger through &#8220;word of mouth&#8221; also in the ecommerce age. Here are a few tips to help you along:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Keep the message simple.</strong> It should be easy to understand, effortless comprehension</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use hashtags.</strong> This allows prospective followers / buyers can “find” your products easily, and with time can become loyal to your brand. Eg: #handmadegifts / #glassjewellery / #pearlnecklace / #giftsforher / #exquisitexmasornaments could be few suggestions for a shop selling handmade glass ornaments targeted at female buying audience</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Design a communication strategy</strong>, and follow it! Brands are established over a period of time –– and a plan will help you to march closer to that date in the future.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Invest in images</strong>. Images get more views in any media, and increase the chances of traffic directing to your estore, building brand recognition.</li>

<p class="p1">Serious ecommerce businesses have to build branding to create brand loyalty in order to acquire brand equity and attract a bunch of money.</p>
<p class="p1">Whether it is a traditional business or today&#8217;s ecommerce brands, the most valuable asset for building a branding are visual. Visuals include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">logo</li>
<li class="p1">colors</li>
<li class="p1">fonts</li>
<li class="p1">photos</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The human brain processes images and remembers them forever. Brands can use photos to create the right image of their brands in their consumers&#8217; minds. Investing on building the visual assets, especially photos, will pay off in terms of branding and faster than any other investment made on the textual brand strategy.</p>

<p class="p1">Let your customers describe your brand to you, and THEN come up with branding and positioning statements. This creates brands that feel more honest.</p>

<p class="p1">I&#8217;m amazed at the number of brands that skimp on the basic areas like keeping site design clean and consistent, and making sure copy has the right tone and voice.</p>

<p class="p1">Develop more than a brand. Craft a worldview for your company, including a set of values, commercial goals, and social interests, and infuse all content and communications with this worldview.</p>
<p class="p1">Then identify a circle of influencers in line with that worldview and see what brands impact their social outreach. It never hurts to see what the successful brands do right, then model your efforts after theirs.</p>

<p class="p1">Employ a standardized &#8220;Style&#8221; or &#8220;Branding&#8221; Guide for your company. Most companies just think about the logo itself and not how it will be applied throughout multiple designers/teams.</p>

<p class="p1">Spend the time and the money to develop your brand. With Amazon selling virtually everything, you need to have a value proposition and brand message that stands out and gives a customer a reason to go through the hassle of ordering from you instead of a one-click Amazon purchase.</p>

<p class="p1">The #1 piece of advice for ecommerce business in regards to branding is to have a cohesive look all across your social media platforms and blog.</p>
<p class="p1">As tempting as it can be to post that puppy picture, if it’s not relevant to your niche don&#8217;t post it.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">Building a truly great brand and creating a close relationship with the target customer is an art in and of itself. This crucial piece of the ecommerce puzzle is what separates the “haves and have nots” in the industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><em>I built a website, promoted it on Facebook and am getting a lot of visitors, but no one is buying.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Yea, that happened to me, too. When I first launched my business on BigCommerce, I had the site up and running rather easily. It looked the way I wanted it to. It worked the way I wanted it to. All I had to do, I thought, was get traffic there and presto: I’d have revenue coming in.</p>
<p class="p1">That isn’t how it happened at all.</p>
<p class="p1">When real visitors landed on my site –– pushed there by <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-advertising-guide/">real advertising dollars I had spent on Facebook</a> –– none of them were turning into real revenue. That’s when I realized I had more work to do. Building a profitable business isn’t just about setting it up well, it looking nice and then driving traffic to it. Instead, those are just the very first steps.</p>
<p class="p1">There are nuances to earning that sale –– what we will call “conversion” from here on out –– that are crucial for all business owners to know. And conversion doesn’t just happen: you need to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-online-store-increase-conversion-rates/">optimize for it.</a></p>
<p class="p1">This applies whether you are just starting up and running the whole show yourself, or if you are an ecommerce manager or marketing director who has signed up to hit massive goals and KPIs for the year.</p>
<p class="p1">First, let’s begin by defining a conversion –– which often has a different definition business to business.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>RSVP for the Ecommerce Growth Summit</h3></p>

<h2 class="p3">What is a conversion?</h2>
<p class="p1">When you are looking to increase your conversion rate, you need to know your end goal. Determine what a “conversion” means to your business.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Do you need more ecommerce sales?</li>
<li class="p1">Need to grow your email list?</li>
<li class="p1">Get more visibility for your brand?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">This guide covers how to increase ecommerce conversion rates on your site. Each of the bullets above are worth a guide all their own (the links of which above will get you on the right track).</p>
<p class="p1">“Conversion” is such a broad topic because it can be impacted by every aspect of the user experience on your site. Conversion rate optimization is the process of improving the shopping experience to drive a specific KPI — usually, sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Conversion rate optimization (CRO) can be conducted on landing pages, category pages, or any other customer touchpoint.</p>
<h2 class="p3">What is a good ecommerce conversion rate?</h2>
<p class="p1">Average ecommerce conversion rates are 1% &#8211; 2%. Even if you are doing everything right, you can still expect to win the sale around 2% of the time.</p>
<p class="p1">The following 28 steps are what helped me to reach 2% conversion on my own site. The outcome of these steps is measured by conversion rate, but in reality they all made a small, incremental improvement to the overall shopping experience.</p>
<p class="p1">A 2%+ conversion rate should be the baseline goal for your online store. Once you hit that and are doing all 28 of the below effectively, then you can move onto more advanced conversion rate tactics.</p>
<h2 class="p3">How do you calculate conversion rate for an ecommerce website?</h2>
<p class="p1">A quick example: If your online store is getting 5,000 visitors and 50 conversions for a set period, that means your store’s conversion rate is 1%. Simple as that! Divide conversion into visitors and you have conversion rate.</p>
<p class="p1">Most analytics tools provide conversion rate in any segmentation of the data, which we’ll get into in the sections below.</p>
<p class="p1">Before we go through what to do to increase conversions, we need to know exactly what your current visitors are doing, where they are getting stuck and how they interact with your website.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course when experts talk about increasing conversions you will hear a common theme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><em>Test, test, test.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">I am all for testing. However, it is important to know what are your current conversion issues are and understand the basics before you can know what you should test.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Step 1: Understand Your Current Conversion Issues</h2>
<p class="p1">There are some invaluable and very useful tools to help analyze your current conversion rate issues. The following five are my personal favorite conversion analysis tools.</p>
<h3 class="p4"><a href="http://www.inspectlet.com/">Inspectlet</a></h3>
<p class="p1">This is an amazing tool that will let you record every move your visitors make on your website. It will show you the users IP Address, location started page, where they came from and how long they stayed.</p>
<p class="p1">Sign up for an account and put a script tag on your site to start the session recording process. There is a free version that allows you 100 recorded sessions per month if you just want to get a feel for what your users are doing. Just add a script tag to your website and then login to your Inspectlet account. Click on a session to see the recording of each user’s interactivity on your website.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inspectlet-dashboard-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20522" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inspectlet-dashboard-1.png" alt="inspectlet-dashboard (1)" width="640" height="311" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inspectlet-dashboard-1.png 2652w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inspectlet-dashboard-1-300x146.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inspectlet-dashboard-1-750x365.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4"><a href="http://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a></h3>
<p class="p1">Mixpanel allows you to view your website visitors’ actions by placing event catching tags on various elements of your ecommerce website. This will not record like Inspectlet does, but it will give you a very detailed snapshot of what is happening based on where users click, how many times, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">This will help you determine how useful certain form fields are or how important certain sections of your website are to users. You can also setup A/B testing to determine which layouts and fields convert better. This mixpanel account shows a website I worked on and tracked various button clicks. This showed me what users were clicking on most which helped me tweak the form and content — a necessity for effective conversion rate optimization.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mixpanel-pic-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20521" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mixpanel-pic-1.png" alt="mixpanel-pic (1)" width="640" height="579" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mixpanel-pic-1.png 1497w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mixpanel-pic-1-300x271.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/mixpanel-pic-1-750x678.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4"><a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/">CrazyEgg</a></h3>
<p class="p1">CrazyEgg is an eye tracking tool that lets you see where users are scrolling and interacting based on heatmaps, scrollmaps and overlay tools.</p>

<h3 class="p4"><a href="http://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> and Webmaster Tools</h3>
<p class="p1">For most websites, I suggest setting up Google Analytics or something equivalent. This gives you a great view into your website visitors including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">How visitors found your website: This could be from keyword searches in google, referral websites or direct visits.</li>
<li class="p1">How long visitors stay on your website</li>
<li class="p1">Where the visitors are from</li>
<li class="p1">If the visitors are returning or new</li>
<li class="p1">What browser, operating system and if the visitor used a mobile device or desktop/laptop</li>
<li class="p1">How many visitors converted (based on goals setup) and the interaction that lead to the conversion</li>
<li class="p1">Link to your Google Adwords campaign to track paid traffic as well</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">Google Search Console will gives you a peek at what keywords users are typing to find your website (if they click on your website or not). It also shows you various errors that may affect your website rankings such as slow loading pages, broken links, etc.</p>

<h3 class="p4"><a href="http://bigcommerce.evyy.net/c/362882/185949/2941">BigCommerce</a> Analytics</h3>
<p class="p1">If you have your store running on BigCommerce, the platform has an Analytics section in the administration panel that shows all abandoned carts including what products were in the cart at the time of abandonment.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20496" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1" width="640" height="392" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1.png 1127w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1-300x184.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-report-1-750x460.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">There are also analytics on In-Store Searches that will show you what customers are typing into the built-in BigCommerce search tool. This underutilized conversion optimization tactic helps you bridge the gap between what your customers are looking for and your on-site language and content.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20498" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1" width="640" height="401" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1.png 1148w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1-300x188.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-1-750x470.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Look at keywords your potential customers are searching for that *are not* showing up. This can help you determine what you need to add into the store, for example.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20499" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search.png 1160w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-300x178.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-on-site-search-750x445.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce Analytics has multiple other Analytics dashboard, but they are most useful when you have customers. The two above will help you diagnose conversion problems without customers.</p>
<p class="p1">There are a few other great tools out there, but this should be more than enough to get visitor interaction information to figure out where your website is lacking or excelling in regards to conversion rates.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Step Two: Boost Your Conversion Rate</h2>
<h3 class="p4">1. Use high quality product images</h3>
<p class="p1">Think about what you want to see when you are shopping. When you are shopping online you can’t touch the product or put it on. The best thing you can do is to show as detailed an image as possible so that the customer knows exactly what they are getting. I suggest using as high quality images as possible depending on how close you want customers to zoom into the image.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">2. Offer Free Shipping</h3>
<p class="p1">I am not 100% sure why this is such a big deal, but it is. Blame it on Amazon –– everyone does. But facts are facts and everyone likes to think they are getting a deal. Offering free shipping makes customers feel like they are getting some sort of deal even if they aren’t.</p>
<p class="p1">Think you can’t offer free shipping? Keep in mind that this is often a psychological game. Increase your product prices to cover shipping cost if that’s what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Is Free Shipping Really Sustainable?</h3></p>
<p class="p1">The experts over at ShipperHQ say, “Absolutely.” <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/#cmtoc_anchor_id_3">Here’s how to do it.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">3. Use Coupon Codes</h3>
<p class="p1">Create coupon codes that customers can use at checkout to get a specific amount off or a percentage of the purchase.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20500" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1" width="640" height="368" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1.png 1153w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1-798x457.png 798w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1-300x173.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-1-750x431.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20501" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-coupons" width="640" height="346" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons.png 1151w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-300x162.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-coupons-750x406.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4">4. Adjust Product Prices</h3>
<p class="p1">If you are selling brand name items that a lot of other stores offer, unfortunately you might have to price your products at or below the average price in order to compete. Be sure to adjust your prices frequently to see what resonates. Also know that the quality of your marketing and imagery will heavily influence the price someone is willing to pay.</p>
<p class="p1">Fitness brands like Lululemon and Outdoor Voices have done this extremely well. Just check out the article in the <a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/2016/11/outdoor-voices-makes-the-best-sweatpants-for-women.html">New Yorker praising Outdoor Voices’ products</a>. They have clearly targeted the right audience. Market your brand to the right audience, with the right messaging and the right imagery, and the revenue will come in.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">5. Tweak your ecommerce checkout process</h3>
<p class="p1">If your store checkout process is too long, complicated or unconventional, you may lose a lot of customers right as they are ready to buy. This crucial step  in the funnel is where a lot of your split testing, A/B tests and site tweaks should take place.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, there are industry standards for most hosted ecommerce platforms such as BigCommerce, but you may still need to tweak the process based on your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, BigCommerce offers an optimized checkout out-of-the-box that is technically a single page (with a few drop downs and a persistent view of the product(s) being bought).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20502" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout-300x200.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-optimized-checkout-750x501.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Out-of-the-box optimized checkout example.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Some brands like to take this even further and build off that optimized checkout to create a true one-page checkout where you can see the entire checkout process when you land on the page. Multiple BigCommerce partners can help you skin this as needed.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20503" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-one-page-checkout-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>One page checkout skin example, powered by Intuit Solutions.</em></p>
<h3 class="p4">6. Use cart abandonment software</h3>
<p class="p1">If you are getting a lot of abandoned carts –– i.e. Someone lands on your site, puts an item in the cart and then leaves –– then <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/cart-abandonment-software/">abandoned cart software</a> can greatly increase your conversion rates.</p>
<p class="p1">This software works with users that have added items to their shopping cart, entered their email and details and then left your store. Some ecommerce platforms offer this software free as part of the store functionality. Thankfully, BigCommerce is one of those.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s an example of the first email from a BigCommerce customer after an abandoned cart.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20524" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1" width="640" height="397" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1.png 971w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1-300x186.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-1-750x466.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Their software allows you to create follow-up emails that will send the user an email with their cart contents as well as allow you to give them a coupon code to get a discount as an incentive to complete their order. Decreasing abandonment rate should be a high priority for online store owners, since this cohort of users have demonstrated interest — and abandonment is often between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonment_rate">60 and 80%</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20505" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20504" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email.png 1134w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-300x180.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-abandoned-cart-email-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The success of this software is different for every store, but there is no doubt that it helps pretty much 100% of ecommerce stores that use it. Some stores see as much as a 30% increase in their website conversion rates. Acting on cart abandonment by itself can take you from low to average conversion rate.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Abandoned Cart Calculator</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Use this <a href="http://tools.bigcommerce.com/abandoned-cart-calculator/">Abandoned Cart Calculator</a> to see how much more revenue you could be making.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">7. Use live chat software</h3>
<p class="p1">I have had mixed results with this. I believe this can increase conversions, but I would suggest that if you choose to use live chat software that you are truly available during business hours to immediately respond to customers that request a chat.</p>
<p class="p1">Do not let the software go into the mode that says you are currently unavailable and that they can leave a message. That sends a bad signal. It would be better to not implement at all if you can’t be there when they want to chat.</p>
<p class="p1">What this does though is build a direct communication line from your potential customer to you. Creating a real human connection will help build trust for this purchase as well as lifetime loyalty in the future.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">8. Let customers know your ecommerce store is safe</h3>
<p class="p1">This is subtle, but a really big deal. You need to build a certain level of trust in a short amount of time for customers to be willing to enter their credit card information on your website.</p>
<p class="p1">Finding ways to enhance your on-site trust and credibility should be the basis for many of your conversion rate optimization activities.</p>
<p class="p1">Customers want to know that they are dealing with a legitimate store that has industry standard security measures in place that ensures them their credit card information will be protected. Here are a few things that help:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Install SSL at checkout (out-of-the-box on most ecommerce platforms) and site wide if possible.</li>
<li class="p1">Show small images of credit cards, PayPal and other payment options as a visual signal that you use customer-trust payment options.</li>
<li class="p1">Display some sort of McAfee, GeoTrust or other security badges, and make sure that you actually have an active account with them. Don’t just add an image if you aren’t truly secure.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>SSL How You Need It</h3></p>
<p class="p1">In addition to the shared SSL certificate used by all BigCommerce stores, BigCommerce also offers <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/BigCommerce-SSL-Options">dedicated SSL certificates verified by GeoTrust</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">9. Setup structure so visitors can easily find products</h3>
<p class="p1">Structure your product categories in a logical manner, but make sure you use as few levels as possible to allow a user to reach a product as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-categories.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20506" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-categories.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-categories" width="640" height="444" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-categories.png 1066w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-categories-300x208.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-categories-750x521.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I simplified mine like the above. Oftentimes, it is also necessary to allow customers to Shop by Color or other various fields.</p>
<p class="p1">Setup a rotating banner to showcase top products. Here is an example from <a href="https://www.trustthebum.com/">Trust the Bum</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">Also, implement a website search to allow customers to find products easily. The faster a visitor can find a product, the more likely they are to buy from you.</p>
<h3 class="p4">10. Make your checkout form easy to understand</h3>
<p class="p1">Make sure that everything on your checkout form is completely understood, such as CVV and input formats. In fact, if you can, I would have the fields limit only what can be typed into certain fields to make it easier for users.</p>
<p class="p1">So, when a user types a credit card number, format it for them as they go along to make it easier to read and harder to mess up.</p>
<p class="p1">In a date field, don’t let the user type, but have a date picker or dropdown.</p>
<p class="p1">The user is already reluctant to enter their personal credit/debit card info already. Don’t give them any reason to feel uncomfortable or make it hard for them to check out.</p>
<p class="p1">Digital wallets are help tremendously with this. Digital wallets are payment processors like PayPal Express, Amazon Pay, Apple Pay, and others. These systems allow users to sign in with their account information and then pre-populates everything for them. It is faster for them, and more secure for everyone.</p>

<h3 class="p4">11. Always show shopping cart contents</h3>
<p class="p1">Show a shopping cart icon with a link to get to it after the user has entered an item into the cart. If they can’t find the cart they can’t checkout.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, be sure to show customers what they are actually buying as they checkout. As mentioned earlier, BigCommerce’s optimized checkout does this out of the box.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20510" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-checkout-example-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<h3 class="p4">12. Let customers checkout as guests</h3>
<p class="p1">Allow users to checkout without signing up for an account. You will have their name and email address when they buy anyway. Forcing the user to register is just giving them another reason to leave your store.</p>
<p class="p1">See image above to see how that works.</p>
<h3 class="p4">13. Give detailed product descriptions</h3>
<p class="p1">Make sure you describe the product in great detail so the customer knows exactly what they are getting. Remember, they can’t touch the product and they are not in a store where they can ask questions. This will also prevent returns.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>All of <a href="https://sierradesigns.com/clip-flashlight-2/">Sierra Designs</a>’ products have videos featured on their product page showing the product off and in use.</em></p>
<p class="p1">All of this helps to build your SEO ranking as well –– so it is beneficial for your for multiple reasons.</p>
<h3 class="p4">14. Allow customers to review products</h3>
<p class="p1">Why do so many people buy from Amazon? Because of the reviews.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember the last time you went to buy a product online. Did you search for reviews before buying? I bet you did.</p>
<p class="p1">You could even offer customers a coupon code or other type of incentive next time they purchase as a reward for providing a review. Also, ask the customer to voice any complaints to you so you have the opportunity to address any issues as this will help you receive more positive reviews.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Generate 62% More Revenue</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Product reviews and testimonials are powerful. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/customer-testimonials/">Here’s how to use them to sell more. </a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">15. Make your “Add to Cart” and “Checkout” buttons prevalent</h3>
<p class="p1">Sometimes a user is thinking of buying and can be further prompted to do so by an actionable button that says exactly what to do and that stands out from all the other surrounding text and images.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">“Simply changing our CTA from black to a blue color has reduced abandoned carts by up to 50%”</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Jeremy Hagon, Marketing Manager, Andreas Carter Sports</div></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">16. Provide product testimonials if applicable</h3>
<p class="p1">Ever heard the statement ‘Facts Tell, but Stories Sell’? Well, it’s true. Testimonials are way more powerful than just a list of features.</p>
<p class="p1">Prove your product works by using real testimonials. Start by offering your product for review to prominent review websites (that give honest reviews) and use this as a starting point for your testimonials.</p>
<p class="p1">Hint –– press reviews counts!</p>

<h3 class="p4">17. Have a great product return policy</h3>
<p class="p1">Most customers (over 50%) will read the return policy before buying. Don’t over-promise here, but definitely make it as painless and as easy as possible for customers to return products (within reason). This may not sound like conversion optimization, but is another example of basic business practices acting as CRO.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">18. Optimize for mobile devices</h3>
<p class="p1">Your ecommerce store needs to work on mobile devices. Hosted stores such as BigCommerce support this out of the box, but you may need to tweak how it looks and works on a mobile device for your own specific business needs.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Mobile Responsive Out-of-the-Box</h3></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">19. Have a phone number</h3>
<p class="p1">You can buy a toll-free phone number for fairly cheap using services such as tollfreeforwarding.com (which is where I bought my number for FabFutons.com).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20512" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-phone-number-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I would also suggest having a professional record the phone menu or voicemail for you if you are a smaller store so that you can project a more professional image and make customers feel more comfortable buying from you.</p>
<p class="p1">You can find professional voice over freelancers on Fiverr.com and UpWork.com. I have personally used and recommend Fiverr.com.</p>
<h3 class="p4">20. Provide valuable content</h3>
<p class="p1">Write useful and valuable content to supplement your products. The more value and information you can provide your customer, the more likely they are to buy from you (as opposed to a competitor that does not offer as much).</p>
<p class="p1">This includes writing valuable content on your product pages, but also using blog content to educate, inform and engage your target audience. This will also help to increase organic SEO traffic.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, not traditional conversion rate optimization, but still moves the needle.</p>
<p class="p1">See below how<a href="http://www.kap7.com/drills-tips/"> Kap7</a> uses content about water polo drills and tips to supplement their expertise in water polo swimwear.</p>

<h3 class="p4">21. Try and catch customers before they leave</h3>
<p class="p1">Once a customer leaves, they are most likely going to buy from somewhere else.</p>
<p class="p1">While I hate pop ups as much as the next guy, but the last chance you have to catch a potential customer is the moment they are trying to exit your website.</p>
<p class="p1">You can use software such as MaxTraffic, OptiMonk, Sleeknote, Sumome or OptinMonster. Your goal here is to collect an email and drive your subscription base. Your subscription base (whether they are customers or not) are people you do not have to spend money on to advertise or market to –– because you can send them an email, instead. You want that list to be as large and engaged (i.e. actively opening the emails) as possible.</p>

<h3 class="p4">22. Grab visitors’ attention quickly</h3>
<p class="p1">If you can’t grab the visitor’s attention in the first 3 seconds, then you probably have lost them.</p>
<p class="p1">Images will be the first thing someone sees and uses to judge a website subconsciously. Make sure if you are going to use large images on the homepage to choose carefully and try to catch the visitors attention in a positive way.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">23. Use “Calls to Action” sparingly</h3>
<p class="p1">Don’t overwhelm a visitor with too many options and CTAs on one screen. I suggest having an ‘Add to Wishlist’, ‘Share Icons’, ‘Add to Cart’, ‘Learn More’, etc all in the same area on the same page.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-social.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20517" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-social.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-social" width="640" height="340" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-social.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-social-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Drive the user to the call-to-action that you want them to perform on that page. If they are on a product page, then use ‘Add to Cart’. If they are on the Cart page use: ‘Proceed to Checkout’.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Ecommerce CTAs</h3></p>
<p class="p1">See how <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-ctas/">dozens of other stores use CTAs</a> to earn more revenue with each visit.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">24. Use a tripwire offer</h3>
<p class="p1">A tripwire is a low-cost almost undeniable deal to get a visitor to purchase from you.</p>
<p class="p1">This does two things:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">First, it allows you to “get the money flowing” as perfected by American Pickers. This builds trust.</li>
<li class="p1">The second thing is does is allow you to offer a higher priced / upsell to the current customer. You can now approach them as a customer and treat them as such. Give them special treatment and offer them something they cannot get as a normal visitor. This is just a longer process of building trust. You can also use this as a way to grow your ecommerce email list, which allows you to sell to the list at any time even if you don’t try and sell them something immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">The Badass Beard Care team was done this perfectly. They offer a free sample of the product in an ad on Facebook. The customer only pays for shipping. This gets the product in the customer’s hand, and gets that customer’s information to the marketing gurus at Badass Beard Care.</p>

<h3 class="p4">25. Do small incremental changes</h3>
<p class="p1">When tweaking your website, be sure to do small changes so you can test and measure what changes helped or hurt your conversion rates.</p>
<h3 class="p4">26. Dare to be different</h3>
<p class="p1">Explain why a visitor should buy from you. What makes you different from all the others selling the same products. What is your Unique Value Proposition. Why would I buy from you?</p>

<h3 class="p4">27. Spell check</h3>
<p class="p1">Yes, you read that right. Make sure you spell everything correctly. Not doing this may hurt your sales as people will lose confidence and trust in your company.</p>
<h3 class="p4">28. Measure your ecommerce conversion rate optimization success</h3>
<p class="p1">There are a couple of ways to make sure your tweaks and changes are working. The obvious one is to verify that your conversion rates are increasing.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20516" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats" width="640" height="351" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats.png 1130w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats-300x164.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-store-stats-750x411.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>BigCommerce tracks your store&#8217;s conversion rates day-over-day, week-over-week, month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and in any customizable way you want to see it. You can view it easily on your dashboard, or on the Analytics Dashboard.</em></p>
<p class="p1">There is more than just increasing conversions, though, as you want to make sure your value per customer or bottom line is increasing as well.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s more important to know what you are going to do with the traffic you receive than to just try and always get more traffic. Make the most of what you already have and then push for more traffic.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Step 3: What to Do With Your New Customers</h2>
<p class="p1">The conversion optimization game doesn’t end when you make a first sale. It doesn’t end when your make your 100th sale either. It’s great that you now have customers, but now is the time you go from that 2% conversion rate to something much higher.</p>
<p class="p1">Small tweaks can seriously boost your bottom line, and while your front-end conversion rate is now optimized for 2% conversion, and getting you customers, it’s time to optimize your back-end conversion rate. This means you’ll now want to focus on driving repeat purchases in a predictable way.</p>
<p class="p1">Why predictable? Because once you have a baseline average conversion rate for your site and a steady repeat purchase rate from already existing customers –– you can better determine how much to spend on advertising to win a customer over. This is because your ROAS (return on ad spend) lowers as repeat purchases increase.</p>
<p class="p1">Ecommerce expert <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanwbowman?lang=en">Bryan Bowman</a> calls this the “Value Ladder.”</p>
<p class="p1">At this year’s PROSPER Show in Las Vegas, he gave a fantastic presentation about how to build a value ladder, beginning with free educational content (i.e. your blog) and moving people up the awareness ladder to increased sales with your brand. Here is how he drew it out.</p>
<p class="p1">Literally, he hand drew it.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-value-ladder.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20530" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-value-ladder.png" alt="conversion-rate-optimization-value-ladder" width="640" height="368" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-value-ladder.png 651w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/conversion-rate-optimization-value-ladder-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Here are the steps he described –– paraphrased here –– to build a value ladder.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The Free Stage</h3>
<p class="p1">Potential customers begin at an unaware stage. They don’t know they are looking for your product. You must educate them –– in a non-salesy way. If you are selling fishing lures, for instance, start with content about, “Seven Reason Why Your Last Fishing Trip Wasn’t Successful.” Maybe only one of those reasons is fishing lures.</p>
<p class="p1">At this stage, work to capture emails via pop ups as described below, or retarget visitors with ads to pull them back to the site. They are now aware they might have a fishing lure problem.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The $ Stage</h3>
<p class="p1">In this first conversion stage (if you are measuring conversions as a sale), a customer may only be comfortable enough with your brand to buy something small. Offer an inexpensive lure that can help solve their problem as a tester. This is similar to the Badass Beard Care “free product” offer mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="p1">At this point, you will have the customer’s email and can begin using an email nurture stream, rather than additional advertising dollars to continue them up the value ladder.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The $$ Stage</h3>
<p class="p1">Now, they have tried your lure and like it. Offer them a subscription service to multiple lures, or monthly lures. Or, offer them a bundle. Either way, you are moving them up the value ladder.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The $$$ Stage</h3>
<p class="p1">Often, each stage will require a new “awareness” problem. For instance, say you now want to sell someone a tackle box for all their new lures. First, you have to educate them on why their current tackle box isn’t fitting the bill.</p>
<p class="p1">In this way, the value ladder often starts over. The difference, however, is that you already have the customer’s business and email address. You don’t need to re-advertise to them. You just need to keep them engaged with your brand and content via email nurture streams –– and lead them down a new, higher cost funnel.</p>
<h3 class="p4">The $$$$+ Stages</h3>
<p class="p1">At this point, your ecommerce business is more mature and it may make sense to partner with other brands to offer fishing trips (for example) to your audience and move them even further up both the value and engagement ladder. This is where your big ticket item purchases will occur –– after someone has purchased with you and trusts your brand.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Other Metrics to Help Measure Conversion</h2>
<p class="p1">Beyond how well your store converts there are a few other metrics that matter when discussing conversion. That’s because they are indicative of engaged or disengaged user behavior. Moving these metric sin the right direction will generally help your overall conversion rate.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/4-tips-improve-ecommerce-bounce-rate-right-now-sellmore-video/">Bounce Rate</a></strong> is the percentage of people who leave after viewing a single page. A high bounce rate is not a good thing – for some reason (or reasons), people aren’t finding what they’re looking for on your store, so they are leaving immediately after landing on your site.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2525491?hl=en">Exit Rate</a></strong>, often confused with bounce rate, is the percentage of people who leave after viewing the page. Your exit rate lets you know the last page that users view before they move on. A very high exit rate on a specific page can be a red flag.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Click through rate</strong>: The number of people who click a link to your website from an ad or email. Optimization for AdWords or email marketing campaigns often focuses on getting more users to click through to your website and take an action — or even engage on social media.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can find these metrics in your Google Analytics account under “Behavior &gt; Overview”</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1006253?hl=en">Average Session Duration</a></strong> is an engagement metric that gives you a general idea of how long people are sticking around your site. A high bounce rate means a low average time on site — visitors aren’t sticking around long enough to do whatever it is you want them to do (convert).</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Average Page Depth</strong> (AKA Pages per Session in Google Analytics) is an engagement metric that tells you how many pages a potential shopper visited before leaving. This metric is simply total pageviews per session duration. Note that more page views can mean more engagement but also can mean a lack of clarity in your conversion funnel if no conversion is present.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can find these metrics in your Google Analytics account under “Audience &gt; Overview”.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">The value ladder isn’t perfect for everyone, but it does do a great job at explaining why it is important for you to think through what you will do with your customer once you get them in. Driving repeat business is extremely valuable, both in terms of revenue as well as brand engagement and interaction. It is how you actually build a brand –– not just a flash sale site.</p>
<p class="p1">But, before you can begin on the value ladder, it is important that you first make sure your website is converting at a baseline level of 1-2%. The 28 steps mention in here will help you to accomplish that and not waste precious advertising dollars.</p>

<p class="p1">This article was written in collaboration with <a href="https://www.gorillagroup.com">Gorilla Group</a>, which contributed heavily to the 9 actionable tips you&#8217;ll read through below.</p>
<p class="p1">Gorilla Group is an award-winning ecommerce service provider – including 4 Webby Awards and 2 Interactive Media Awards – and <a href="https://partners.bigcommerce.com/directory/partner/252631/gorilla-group">BigCommerce Elite Partner</a>. Their team works with category-leading brands looking to launch B2B as well as Direct-to-Consumer including Cargill, Citizens of Humanity and Dollar Tree.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">By all the most recent reports, analysts have forecasted that global B2B ecommerce revenue <a href="https://ww2.frost.com/news/press-releases/global-b2b-e-commerce-market-will-reach-67-trillion-usd-2020-finds-frost-sullivan/">will top $6.7 trillion by 2020</a>. As of 2014, U.S. B2B ecommerce alone had already surpassed $5 trillion in revenue.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20323" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-statista" width="640" height="418" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista.png 696w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">And yet, as of 2014, only 22% of B2B businesses in the U.S. were selling online.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20324" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista-1.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-statista-1" width="640" height="419" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista-1.png 706w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista-1-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">That’s a lot of revenue for less than a quarter of the businesses in the market for it. So, what’s holding B2B businesses up? Well, a few misconceptions might be the culprit to begin with.</p>

<h2 class="p5">B2B Ecommerce Misconceptions</h2>
<h3 class="p6">1. The belief they don’t sell “B2B” (i.e. What is B2B Ecommerce?)<span class="s1"><br />
</span></h3>
<p class="p1">The number one reason many brands say they aren’t <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/b2b/">selling B2B</a> is because they don’t realize they are already doing it. Selling B2B is a variety of things, including:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Wholesale</li>
<li class="p1">Distribution relationships with large or chain retailers</li>
<li class="p1">Selling to organizations (schools, businesses, non-profits)</li>
<li class="p1">Supplier selling to resellers</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">You do not have to be a supplier in order to sell B2B. Many online brands are both B2B and B2C –– and even use their same homepage for each audience, segmenting into customer groups for individual merchant accounts.</p>
<p class="p1">Assurant’s MyWit site is a great example. Assurant launched a business-to-employee ecommerce website with BigCommerce, saw incredible growth and then used that same site to sell B2B and B2C.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, through customer groups, the site is segmented for Assurant employees, wholesalers and regular retail customers.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-assurant.png"><img class="wp-image-20336 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-assurant.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-assurant" width="640" height="977" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-assurant.png 1317w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-assurant-300x458.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-assurant-750x1145.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">That said, many B2B sellers are indeed suppliers –– but that isn’t the only type of B2B business out there.</p>
<h3 class="p6">2. The belief B2B customers don’t want to order online</h3>
<p class="p1">As the new generation comes to managerial and purchasing power age, their preferred method of purchasing (ecommerce) will surpass older processes.</p>
<p class="p1">In general, <a href="http://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2014/12/05/new-report-b2b-buyers-are-consumers-too/">B2B customers want to see their B2C conveniences transfer over</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">72% of B2B customers want self-service access to accounts and orders</li>
<li class="p1">64% of B2B customers want scheduled deliveries</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">3. The belief ecommerce requires price transparency.</h3>
<p class="p1">With low margins and fierce competitors looking to underbid a B2B business, many brands don’t want their prices available to the public.</p>
<p class="p1">This safeguarding of the supply chain is understandable –- and it’s why many ecommerce solutions offer price availability only after a customer logs in.</p>
<p class="p1">This means only your customers see the prices –– and that prices can be presented exactly as negotiated for individual customers.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20351" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1" width="640" height="301" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1.png 1123w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1-300x141.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1-750x353.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You can also use your site to enable product visibility, but require customers who are not logged in to their customer groups (likely a prospect) to call in to get prices.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-availability.png"><img class="wp-image-20337 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-availability.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-availability" width="640" height="185" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-availability.png 1132w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-availability-300x87.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-availability-750x217.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p6">4. The belief online ordering is cold.</h3>
<p class="p1">One of the best ways to make sure a customer doesn’t go to a competitor is by building a long-term, personal relationship with them. This is why so many B2B businesses are family-owned and operated. There’s a personal touch to being one of the family: phone calls, dinners, visits and trips.</p>
<p class="p1">An online store can seem cold in comparison, but it doesn’t have to be. With 24/7 chat technology that can turn an online chat on your store into a text on your phone, the new generation can communicate efficiently and effectively in their preferred communication channel: text, Facebook messenger or a variety of other options.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, this type of customer service is not only easy to set up, it is highly desired by customers across the board.</p>
<p class="p1">See how JMC Automotive Equipment uses chat as well as a highly visible phone number to drive conversions on their site.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20338" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p6">5. The belief an online store negates custom ordering.</h3>
<p class="p1">With B2B customers and wholesalers, the possibility for custom orders is much higher than for a B2C site. And for many B2B businesses, they want to provide for the custom order (which helps with that personal relationship). But custom orders aren’t often an ecommerce norm –- or so many people think.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to custom quoting tools, unique variants and segmented customer groups, B2B businesses can allow customers to send in a PDF quote 24/7, then evaluate the quote and get back within regular business hours on if the unique order can be filled. If it can, the business can place that customer in their own unique customer group so that next time they order, they won’t have to go through the quote engine. They can just click and checkout the item that is made specially for them.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is how Spectrum Audio has set up their quoting tool using <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/quote-ninja/">Quote Ninja</a>.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja.png"><img class="wp-image-20339 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">No matter what your hesitation is to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/b2b-ecommerce-solution/">launching your B2B ecommerce store</a>, know this: nothing needed for a B2B business to prosper online cannot be done.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Have customers who need bulk ordering? <strong>Done.</strong></li>
<li class="p1">Have customers who need specific sizes or materials? <strong>Check. </strong></li>
<li class="p1">Have customers with on-going accounts or pre-negotiated rates? <strong>Taken care of.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">It’s time for your business to take a pie of the $6.7 trillion dollar pie. Here’s how to market to your B2B customers to grow your online sales, streamline your business and focus on what you do best: getting product into the hands of your customers.</p>
<h2 class="p5">B2B Ecommerce Marketing 101</h2>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Trending Topics in B2B Ecommerce</h3></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gorillagroup.com/trending/">Keep your finger on the pulse of the B2B ecommerce industry with trending topics and insights from Gorilla Group.</a></p>
<p></div>
<h3 class="p6">1.Educate customers on products, features, and promotions</h3>
<p class="p6">The concept of an online strategy interweaving content and commerce has a very practical application. If a user is not presented with all of the information –– from sizing charts, to ingredient lists, to how-to guides –– they will seek it elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p1">That exploration often results in the consumer entering another purchasing funnel outside your organization’s digital commerce channel. B2B user experiences have transformed from green screen-like portals with limited information into educational avenues that push product and promotions to your buyers.</p>
<p class="p1">Why? Because this is the way the online value ladder works.</p>
<p class="p1">You prove your value to customers for free through educational content, and then you close the deal once they trust you. Companies using a B2B business model have long done this with conversations over phone or drinks. Now, you need to do it to drive traffic and close sales online.</p>
<p class="p1">A great example of how this can be done is over on Bright Agrotech’s site. Bright Agrotech sells to both established and aspiring farmers –– and they provide all possible education to help customers at each stage of their farming business to succeed.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20340" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech" width="640" height="1025" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech.png 1237w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech-300x481.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech-750x1202.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">This is only a small subset of all the educational material Bright Agrotech offers. For any offers that are free, of which they have many, the team puts the content behind a gate to drive email leads which they can nurture into customers.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20341" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p6">2. Migrate customers from offline to online channels</h3>
<p class="p6">The number of B2B customers that prefer to speak to a sales rep in person or using phone, fax, or even email will continue to decrease at a rapid pace as Millennial buyers gain more decision-making and purchasing power within their organizations.</p>
<p class="p1">Forrester Research estimates that<a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/andy_hoar/15-04-14-death_of_a_b2b_salesman"> 93% of B2B buyers prefer to buy online</a> when they’ve already decided what to buy.</p>
<p class="p1">If your team is implementing a new ecommerce channel, be sure to communicate early and often with your customers. Some companies have been successful in inviting their core customers into beta testing to train, educate, and gain valuable feedback.</p>
<p class="p1">Regardless of how you introduce the digital channel, anticipate questions and concerns, and, most importantly, highlight the benefits of migrating to the new platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Create FAQs, how-to guides, and interactive navigations to ensure customers can use the platform efficiently.</p>
<p class="p1">The Knobs Co does this well by pointing B2B customers to a dedicated landing page from the homepage and clearly stating the benefits of their online purchasing program.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20345" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Once you land on the Trade Professionals page, you get further information on why you might want to join the program and purchase from them.</p>

<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em>Screenshot 3</em></p>
<p class="p1">A few things The Knobs Co does really well:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>On Screenshot 1:</strong> Information describing what those who fill out the form can expect, from customer service to quality of the product.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>On Screenshot 2:</strong> A dedicated form to drive leads so they can immediately contact anyone interested.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>On Screenshot 3:</strong> Additional resources at the end of the page so customers can browse other areas if they aren’t yet ready to buy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">3. Use technology to solve ongoing customer challenges</h3>
<p class="p6">One very large B2B Manufacturer in the Food &amp; Beverage industry used ecommerce to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/migrations/">migrate</a> to customer self-service, and was able to decrease error rates by more than 80%.</p>
<p class="p1">B2B fulfillment errors are typically exponentially greater than those associated with B2C or direct-to-consumer shopping, due to the nature of the type and quantities of product ordered.</p>
<p class="p1">Mistakes can result in truck or trainloads of product being impacted. In addition to the obvious bottom line impacts, the Food &amp; Beverage company was able to consistently deliver the right products on time while meeting expectations.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead of dealing with customer service challenges, refunds, and apologies, the company has been able to develop new relationships and introduce ancillary services.</p>
<p class="p1">So, how did they do it? It’s about visibility.</p>
<p class="p7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Automatic Inventory Management from a Customer Viewpoint</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Setup rules to alert customers to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/inventory-count/">inventory counts</a> and show out of stock without having to do a single thing.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20346" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings" width="640" height="373" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings.png 1155w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings-300x175.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings-750x437.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Order Dashboard Visibility for the Fulfillment Team</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">A clear order dashboard is available for your fulfillment teams. You can also use APIs to send order information to an ERP for a real-time sync.</p>
<p class="p1">From this view, you can also clearly see the fulfillment process –– what has been sent out, what is pending and why.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20347" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1.png" alt="b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1" width="640" height="381" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1.png 1135w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1-300x179.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1-750x447.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Further, beyond an orders dashboard, you can drill into each individual order to see fulfillment stage, order details, PO numbers and more.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-view.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20348" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-view.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-order-view" width="640" height="410" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-view.png 1143w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-view-300x192.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-view-750x480.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<h3 class="p6">4. Roll out programs that spur loyalty, higher order values, and increased purchasing frequency</h3>
<p class="p6">After the platform has been deployed, look to other initiatives to continually turn the needle.</p>
<p class="p1">Likely, if you are a B2B organization, you supply products that are consumable or will need to be continually maintained and replaced. Allowing for both subscription-based and traditional one-off purchases can lock in buyers, yield higher customer lifetime values, and simplify doing business.</p>
<p class="p1">Furthermore, the data can empower your sales team to present and offer complementary products, as well as understand when a customer might be ready to buy.</p>
<p class="p1">Industry behemoth Amazon has already begun to implement these programs. For instance, certain products, such as this air filter, can be purchased in regular (monthly) increments.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20349" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">On your own ecommerce store, you can use integrations with partners like Rebilla to manage <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/rebillia-saved-credit-cards/">saved credit card information</a> for individual customers, or <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/recurring-payments-invoicing-by-paywhirl/">PayWhirl for recurring billing. </a></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-recurring.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20350" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-recurring.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-recurring" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-recurring.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-recurring-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-recurring-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of a recurring billing option on a BigCommerce store.</em></p>
<h3 class="p6">5. Align business processes and teams to scale</h3>
<p class="p6">Organizations often find themselves working inefficiently due to resources being in the wrong roles, or process silos that negatively impact momentum.</p>
<p class="p1">These obstacles occur either because the digital channel was built as an ‘add-on,’ and not cohesively structured within the organization, or because organic decisions over time have morphed into a structure (i.e. solely Marketing or IT “owning” the ecommerce software) that no longer has an effective foundation for cross channel cohesive growth.</p>
<p class="p1">Review your current organizational structure. Re-align your roles and resources. If need be, look outside the organization and hire. Once that structure is in place, have a charter over budgeting and management decisions that impact this digital team.</p>
<h3 class="p6">6. Reduce back-office costs and sunset legacy systems</h3>
<p class="p6">As commerce platforms become more robust in functionality beyond just a “shopping cart,” their reach and influence within a company’s existing technology landscape is widening.</p>
<p class="p1">Lines of traditional applications are blurring as large software companies are acquiring and integrating smaller, specialized software at a rapid pace.</p>
<p class="p1">When undergoing a digital commerce initiative, it is important to understand the selected commerce technology platform’s roadmap and what that signifies in terms of capabilities. This knowledge could allow you to trim license and maintenance costs on overlapping technology and reduce technical bloat.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How to Find a Company’s Road Map</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Because of competition, many ecommerce platforms do not release their road maps publicly. BigCommerce customers can join in <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/meet-new-bigcommerce-community/">on monthly Town Halls to get updates</a>. For prospects, it is wise to <a href="https://partners.bigcommerce.com/directory/search?f0=Partner+Tier&amp;f0v0=Elite">talk to partner agencies which are experts in the B2B space</a>, like Gorilla Group. They will direct you to the ecommerce platform right for your business and explain how all of your needs will be built-in on budget.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p6">7. Ensure ecommerce complements all other sales channels</h3>
<p class="p6">Internal Channel Conflict is a common a pain point for B2B organizations. With industry analysts predicting the demise of the B2B salesman, the online channel is recognized as a legitimate threat.</p>
<p class="p1">Organizations that successfully overcome internal anxiety communicate early and often with the individuals that could be affected. The digital teams, alongside sales leadership, should showcase the benefits of customers leveraging technology-based customer self-service and how it can actually help sales members retire and exceed quotas.</p>
<p>For example, in the telecommunication space, B2C-like ecommerce sites often exist for SBMs to order hardware, upgrade their plans or increase their services. Only if and when that customer becomes complex does an actual sales representative take over the account. This approach allows the team to focus more on selling and less on order taking.</p>
<p class="p1">See here how <a href="http://www.nutreevit.com/">NutreeVit </a>follows this approach. They offer a subscription model for self-service customers, and allow for support outreach or a customer portal in order to upsell or cross-sale customers as needed. There is also a clear Chat Box in the lower right-hand corner.vu</p>

<h3 class="p6">8. Creating Value for the Human Side of the Transaction</h3>
<p class="p1">Usability is an essential element in creating value for customers. This does not necessarily mean creating “consumer-like” ecommerce experiences centered on visual and interactive elements. Instead, focus on factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Site performance</li>
<li class="p1">Robust search, i.e. faceted search</li>
<li class="p1">An efficient purchasing funnel</li>
<li class="p1">Detailed product content</li>
<li class="p1">Simplified checkout to create a “business-like” commerce experience</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Check out BuySwings.com’s simplified checkout process that enables various B2B checkout functionalities not seen on B2C sites.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-buy-swings-checkout.png"><img class="wp-image-20327 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-buy-swings-checkout.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-buy-swings-checkout" width="640" height="1108" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-buy-swings-checkout.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-buy-swings-checkout-300x519.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-buy-swings-checkout-750x1298.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Usability also means empowering customers to take control and complete goals on their terms.</strong> Including responsive design as part of the ecommerce software frees customers to research, complete transactions, and manage their accounts, regardless of device. This cross-device enablement can also make sales representatives in the field far more productive and efficient.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is CleanAir’s desktop site, with their responsive mobile site beneath.</p>

<p class="p1">In terms of engagement, migrating customers to the ecommerce channel should not come at the expense of creating deeper customer relationships.</p>

<p class="p1">B2B customers don’t necessarily interact with the website in the same way consumers do, yet it is important to educate customers and present them with highly relevant information about new products, services, and promotions. Offer targeted content in places it will be seen, like order confirmation pages and within the My Account section.</p>

<h3 class="p6">9. Creating Value for the Business Side of the Transaction</h3>
<p class="p1">No two customers are the same. Customize the ecommerce channel to cater to the way they do business and become an indispensable business partner.</p>
<p class="p1">This starts by building one-to-one relationships. Use segmentation to present customer-specific catalogs and pricing, as well as introduce incentive programs that reward customers for loyalty and the volume of business they transact.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20333" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups" width="640" height="311" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups.png 1127w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-300x146.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-750x365.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Then, develop workflows that align the ecommerce ecosystem with the way your customers do business to remove any friction from the process.</p>
<p class="p1">For instance, if customers require a multi-step order approval process, the underlying ecommerce platform should be built to support this. On many ecommerce platforms, this is done with a Quoting tool.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is what an on-site quote builder looks like for your customers.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20339" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Here is what you see on the backend.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru.png"><img class="wp-image-20322 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru" width="640" height="308" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru.png 853w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru-300x145.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru-750x361.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">The same goes for payments. From enabling Purchase Orders, to checking credit availability and enforcing purchasing thresholds, ensure the ecommerce system conforms to customer needs.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>For wholesale brands which need customer financing options</strong>, look for ecommerce platforms that integrate with Klarna and AfterPay.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-financing.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20334" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-financing.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-financing" width="640" height="663" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-financing.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-financing-300x311.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-financing-750x777.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Keep customers in the loop by being transparent with data. Proactively notify customers of backordered items and low inventory counts for products they purchase to minimize any potential disruption to their business.</p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce automatically emails customers their invoices when an item is ordered and a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">shipping</a> update when it is shipped out. Merchants can use the Orders channel on the BigCommerce backend to dive into any specific area, resend invoices, manage returns and refunds, etc.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-info.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20335" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-info.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-order-info" width="640" height="329" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-info.png 1128w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-info-300x154.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-info-750x385.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And though it’s only applicable in a subset of B2B use cases, enabling punchout to allow catalog feeds and ordering directly through the customer’s procurement system can make the ecommerce channel a powerful tool for building lasting value. That’s why BigCommerce integrates with hundreds of ERP systems, syncing information back and forth in real-time.</p>
<h2 class="p1">25 Experts on B2B Marketing and Ecommerce</h2>
<p class="p2">Beyond getting set up as a B2B online seller, it&#8217;s important that you market yourself appropriately as well. There are crucial differentiations between how B2C and B2B customers want to be marketed toward. That said, those differentiations are becoming more and more alike every day.</p>
<p class="p2">It can be hard to keep up pace. We caught up with 25 industry experts to get their take on how B2B brands should market to their customers.</p>

<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-karl-pawlewicz.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20377 size-full" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-karl-pawlewicz.jpg" alt="b2b-ecommerce-karl-pawlewicz" width="640" height="336" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-karl-pawlewicz.jpg 640w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-karl-pawlewicz-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p3">A 2015 Forrester report by Andy Hoar (&#8220;Death of a B2B Salesman&#8221;) states: &#8220;The data is very clear that B2B buyers now favor do-it-yourself options for researching products and services. By a factor of three to one, B2B buyers want to self-educate versus talk to sales representatives to learn about products and services.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p3">With this shift in preference in mind, use a CRM to capture every customer conversation and review that data often. For example, if you&#8217;re using chat to talk to customers on your website, review your transcripts regularly and look for FAQs. Use this insight to bolster your self-serve help center to make it as useful as possible.</p>

<p class="p3">The customer lifetime value of B2B clients is so high that you need to invest in retaining these clients. Over 50% of your budget should be dedicated to keeping them coming back, since they can have CLVs in the range of thousands of dollars per year.</p>
<p class="p3">Reward them for their patronage and loyalty. Remember that some B2B buyers CANNOT receive gifts due to internal policies, so when you&#8217;re offering rewards give them the option of receiving a discount or a gift.</p>

<p class="p3">Too many B2B vendors still treat websites as a catalog and take orders via phone or fax. Business customers like to access wholesale pricing and volume discount levels online, and many like to purchase online, too. Implement a full cart checkout experience for B2B buyers, complete with freight and volume shipping options.</p>

<p class="p3">Your ecommerce site for wholesale should offer the same level of service you would expect from the traditional method of an account manager on the phone. Consider your customers wants and needs and make it as simple and easy to use as possible.</p>

<p class="p3">Use a theme that is built for B2B style interactions or hire an agency to retool your existing theme into a more &#8216;wholesale&#8217; friendly experience for your customers.

<p class="p3">Take inspiration from B2C ecommerce, but remember that there are differences. Traditionally, B2C has lead the way for innovation in the ecommerce industry, and B2B sellers can learn a great deal from watching B2C retailers, but the two cannot be treated the same.</p>
<p class="p3">One key difference is that B2B tends to involve longer relationships, both before the initial purchase, and as additional or repeat purchases are made. This can be particularly useful for personalization, as more data can be found with a longer buying cycle, but this may require more attention from a traditional sales team and lead to channel conflicts.</p>

<p class="p3">Whether you&#8217;re B2B or B2C, consumers are expecting the B2C experience in terms of how they interact with your business online. If you think about it, this makes complete sense: your customer experience expectations as a consumer don&#8217;t change when you walk through your business&#8217; front door for a day of B2B buying (or selling).</p>
<p class="p3">Make sure the experience is slick and does not violate any preconceived expectations your consumers might have. And when in doubt, use the Amazon customer experience as a benchmark.

<p class="p3">B2B brands should invest in SEO, as job one is simply being found. Next, make sure your offering is clear and simply organized. Because the web provides so many options that are just a back button away, making sure your site answers a potential customers answer quickly is paramount.</p>

<p class="p3">Make it about the customer. While most brands focus on showcasing their products, pricing and features, what customers really care about isn&#8217;t the what it&#8217;s the WHY.</p>
<p class="p3">There are hundreds of competitors out there competing for your audience, why should they choose you? The key is getting to know your customers, understanding their challenges and telling their story –– not your own.</p>
<p class="p3">Most marketers address their customers as numbers, geographical locations or type of browser and completely forget that behind those browsers and screens are people with real challenges, searching for a solution for their problem.</p>
<p class="p3">Specifically with B2B products, these challenges are usually more in-depth and require a greater sense of understanding. These shoppers aren&#8217;t just buying for themselves, they have a team, a manager and other responsibilities to consider that B2C clients may not have.</p>
<p class="p3">If you understand your customer’s real challenges, concerns and needs, you can optimize your site for them, address those concerns first-hand and build an experience that solves their problems and as a result grow your sales.</p>

<p class="p3">Businesses are still made up of humans, so your messaging still has to be human, too. Don&#8217;t think that because you&#8217;re a &#8220;brand&#8221; you have to sit behind this wall of jargon and distracting design.</p>
<p class="p3">Text emails with personality convert well. Authentic messaging and content still works on B2B. Don&#8217;t sacrifice what makes your brand unique because you think it&#8217;s necessary to do so only because you&#8217;re B2B.</p>

<p class="p3">While B2B buyers are also influenced by branding and vision, more than individual consumers B2B buyers also care about practicality. Make it easy to do business with your brand.</p>
<p class="p3">Logistics can often be an especially tricky topic in B2B, so if you aim to target that segment make sure all your shipping, receiving, accounting and return logistics are in place, streamlined, and well communicated to buyers.</p>

<p class="p3">For B2B businesses, being known as value-additive is critical for sales. First and foremost, value-additive content content ranks well in SEO, which is a huge B2B acquisition channel. Secondly, the buyer’s journey for B2B is different than B2C, and the product will likely go through more vetting. Being associated with value additive content improves your perceived ROI.</p>

<p class="p3">I would recommend abandoning the traditional B2B sales methods. Creating a personal relationship with your customers (business or consumer) has become much more important than a great sales pitch.</p>
<p class="p3">B2C communication has increasingly become more personal, and I believe that it’s the way to go for B2B communication as well.</p>

<p class="p3">When it comes to B2B sales, the deals are bigger and fewer than B2C sales, so it’s all about making the most of your opportunities. You need to over-deliver on your prospects’ expectations, so they’ll remember you and feel good about teaming up with you.</p>
<p class="p3">And you need to be active on as many marketing channels as possible, so that wherever your prospects are, you are available to help them out with useful advice.</p>

<p class="p3">The B2B sales process is generally longer and requires multiple marketing touches which means you need to start with leads before you get customers. The best way for B2B businesses to capture more leads is with a lead magnet, also known as gated content. This is a piece of downloadable content that visitors must enter an email to view.</p>
<p class="p3">The most effective lead magnets are relevant to the business and to the content of the landing page. For example, if I&#8217;m selling software for inventory management and a high traffic landing page talks about the big costs associated with inaccurate inventory counts, I&#8217;d present visitors with a guide on how to reduce inventory costs in ecommerce.</p>

<p class="p3">My top piece of advice for brands selling B2B online is to reach their audience with social advocacy. The ROI there is more than any other form of advertisement. The fundamental reason this works is that social advocacy relies on the action and feedback of real people for buying decision. This conversational form of interaction added trust and value to your brand.</p>
<p class="p3">Followers are willing to pay high prices when they see influencing personalities using the product. The investment on social advocacy gets you the currency of trust by your customers.</p>

<p class="p3">Focus on creating a user experience just as powerful as you would expect to have on a B2C-focused web presence. Usability, content, and customer experience are just as important in the B2B environment, as they are within the B2C.</p>
<p class="p3">The key difference is that brands are only recently starting to realize this. Many have successfully pivoted, and are already reaping the rewards.</p>

<p class="p3">Know your demographic. We have seen clients that “sort of” understand who their demographic is. They come to us saying, “Millennials are our core demographic,” but we soon find that is not the case, but that Gen-Xers are more apt to purchase.</p>
<p class="p3">Make sure you pay attention to the digital tools that you use like Facebook Insights or Google Analytics to make sure that you are marketing to the right groups.</p>

<p class="p3">Don&#8217;t rely solely on your B2B store. Leverage existing relationships and salespeople to help guide and drive customers through your store. Target existing customers to upsell them through the store with more selection, easier ordering, and increased responsiveness.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p3">All in all, it is a misconception that the ecommerce world cannot support the needs of B2B sellers and brands. It is not a misconception, however, that your brand may not be ready. Be sure to allocate the appropriate funds to your B2B site launch –– including work with partners and agencies to build the unique tools you need.</p>
<p class="p3">Even though you may need to make an investment, the increase in revenue you can potentially expect <em>vastly</em> outweighs this initial expenditure.</p>
<p class="p3">An ecommerce platform like BigCommerce is more than extensible enough for what you need. But like any good investment and growth opportunity, there will be a small capital investment upfront.</p>
<p class="p3">Don’t worry though. Average launch time is three months –– and sales start pouring in immediately.</p>

<p class="p1">“I come from a family of artists, so it is safe to say I have an eye for color. When I started my design process, I wanted to evoke an overall feeling of calm and peace, therefore I choose this color blue,” says Melissa Bamberg, Founder of NodPod. “Next, the logo came about after doodling many months on paper. I wanted the shape to represent the product. Then a name – the nod in Nodpod is to represent sleep, and then pod to represent the shape of the eye mask, as it looks like a pea pod. Once I had my logo, name and color decided upon, I could visualize the design of the website.”</p>
