				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="800" height="456" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-checkout-hero.png" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-checkout-hero.png 800w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-checkout-hero-798x456.png 798w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-checkout-hero-300x171.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-checkout-hero-750x428.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p class="p1">Checkout optimization is a frequently overlooked area for retailers looking for routes to increase online revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, many online business owners and managers focus on optimizing for the front end of the website –– creating <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/best-ecommerce-website-design/">beautiful designs</a>, site experiences and merchandising product to push customers down a purchase funnel.</p>
<p class="p1">That makes sense. After all, this is your customer’s first impression of your business, and your first opportunity to convince them to stay, browse and buy.</p>
<p class="p1">But when it comes to buying, an online store&#8217;s checkout far surpasses any other element of the website in terms of importance.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the time when you — unknown retailer — present risk to the consumer. There is a reason that 7 out of 10 shopping carts are abandoned. 20+ years after the advent of ecommerce, consumers are still wary of providing sensitive information such as credit card details unless a retailer can prove that it is trustworthy, secure and worthy of the sale.</p>
<p class="p1">There are multiple ways to increase consumer trust with your product at the checkout page. Further, there are multiple ways to reduce abandoned carts on the product page, in the shopping cart and at checkout.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll cover all of these in this post, helping you to address the below reasons of why people abandon cart other than because <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">they aren’t ready to buy</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is that full list:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">61%: Extra costs (shipping, taxes, fees) were too high</li>
<li class="p1">35%: Didn’t want to create an account</li>
<li class="p1">27%: The checkout process was too long or complicated</li>
<li class="p1">24%: Couldn’t see or calculate total order cost up-front</li>
<li class="p1">22%: Reported the website had errors or crashed.</li>
<li class="p1">18% Didn’t trust the online store with their credit card information</li>
<li class="p1">16%: Delivery timeline was much too slow</li>
<li class="p1">10%: Didn’t believe the returns policy to be fair or satisfactory</li>
<li class="p1">8%: Didn’t see their preferred method of payment</li>
<li class="p1">.5%: Their credit card was declined</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Now, it’s worth saying that I don’t believe there’s such a thing as an optimum checkout process. The results will always differ based on the demographic, product complexity, price point and various other variables and the best results are likely to come from continuous testing, monitoring and improvement.</p>
<p class="p1">However, I’ve worked on a number of checkout projects with merchants over the last few years and this post based on many of those experiences.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the actionable tips I generally give to ecommerce businesses looking to improve their checkout experience and gain more from merchants who have started the process.</p>

<h2 class="p3">1. Capture the user’s email address early<span class="s1"><br />
</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">This tactic helps to address issue #1 and #2 in our abandoned cart list above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Whether you like it or not, you’re never going to convert 100% of the users who reach the checkout page (or progress from the cart) – not even close. So, one thing I’ve always tried to do is grab the email address as early as possible, often as an independent first step.</p>
<p class="p1">This first step requires the user to enter their email address and choose whether they want to check out as a guest or create an account for later use. It also ideally performs a lookup to tell the user if the email address already has an account associated with it.</p>
<p class="p1">Hyphen Mattress has a really strong checkout experience and is a great example of how an initial email / user validation stage can be done as a first step (i.e. grabbing the email address). Either way — checking out as guest, or creating an account — the first step is to input your email.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-hyphen-mattress.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20614" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-hyphen-mattress.png" alt="ecommerce checkout" width="640" height="423" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-hyphen-mattress.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-hyphen-mattress-300x198.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-hyphen-mattress-750x495.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The main objective behind grabbing the email address is for shopping cart abandonment campaigns. Without an email, you cannot launch your abandoned cart email series, which often brings back 15% of customers who add an item to cart, get to checkout and then decide not to purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m also a big fan of systems like <a href="https://apps.dotmailer.com/bigcommerce/">DotMailer</a> and <a href="https://www.ometria.com/">Ometria</a>, which require a user to enter their email address in order to tie their behavior to a user, which allows for <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/personalized-marketing/">more personalized email marketing</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Using connections built by companies like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/predictive-marketing-by-windsor-circle/">Windsor Circle for BigCommerce</a> –– or whichever <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-platforms/">ecommerce platform you use</a> –– will allow you to sync data in real-time between your online store and a more personalized email provider like DotMailer.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is a backend view to show you exactly what you can do. Keep in mind, this only works if you grab email addresses early and often.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-dotmailer-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20636" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-dotmailer-1.png" alt="checkout optimization" width="500" height="327" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-dotmailer-1.png 500w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-dotmailer-1-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Easily create marketable customer segments based on specific behavior.</em></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-dotmailer.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20637" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-dotmailer.png" alt="best checkout ux" width="500" height="361" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-dotmailer.png 500w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-dotmailer-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Track how those segments perform.</em></p>
<p class="p1">If don’t need abandoned cart segmentation that&#8217;s so advanced, capturing the email address early in the process is still incredibly important to trigger regular abandoned cart flows. You can set those up out-of-the-box with BigCommerce or through other email providers like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/mailchimp/">MailChimp</a>, <a href="https://apps.dotmailer.com/bigcommerce/">Dotmailer</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/klaviyo-email-marketing-solution/">Klaviyo</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>The Math behind Abandoned Cart and 25% More Revenue</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">Abandoned carts happen. Here’s how to get those customers back</a> and reduce abandonment rate.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">2. Replace or minimize the header and footer, and remove any other distractions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">This tactic helps to address issue #3 in our abandoned cart list above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">I’m a big advocate of removing the core header and footer navigation of the store, in order to prevent any distractions for the user. The focus of the checkout page should be — well, the checkout page.</p>
<p class="p1">Generally, I’d recommend swapping the header for important links (such as delivery information, which should open within a lightbox / modal) and trust signals (such as secure payment gateway, merchant reviews etc, etc).</p>
<p class="p1">Berkey Water is a really good example of this. I’d also often display a link back to the main cart / main store and a phone number or live chat field for questions.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-berkey-water.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20622" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-berkey-water.png" alt="checkout page design inspiration" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-berkey-water.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-berkey-water-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-berkey-water-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Couture Candy is another good example of checkout simplicity. In addition to removing all distractions, the brand also pulls the cart summary information down as you progress through the fields, which I like.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-couture-candy.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20621" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-couture-candy.png" alt="ecommerce checkout flow" width="640" height="428" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-couture-candy.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-couture-candy-300x201.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-couture-candy-750x502.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Out-of-the-Box Optimized Checkout</h3></p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce’s optimized checkout is free to use for all BigCommerce customers and is an out-of-the-box feature. Simply choose “<a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Optimized-Single-Page-Checkout">optimized checkout</a>” for your checkout option on the backend, and your checkout will look like Couture Candy’s.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">3. Keep your cart page / process quick and simple</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">This tactic helps to address issue #3, #4, #7 and #8 in our abandoned cart list above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">With the cart and basket pages, the key is to keep things as simple as possible. Summarize what the user has added to cart and provide a very obvious next step (as well as options around making changes to the order). Only include custom fields that are absolutely necessary, since these naturally provide more shopper friction.</p>
<p class="p1">Remove unnecessary clutter and make <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-ctas/">the call to actions on the page</a> very obvious and clear. If the next step is to choose shipping method, it should be self-explanatory to the customer. They shouldn&#8217;t have to strain to determine where to enter their shipping address or other information. Some type of progress indicator can be useful here as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Sierra Designs has a very strong cart page, which I’d imagine is based on a lot of research and data that positively impacted conversion. I think this cart page is a great example of providing a summary of the order and a very obvious next step for the user to progress through to the next stage of the checkout.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-sierra-designs-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20623" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-sierra-designs-2.png" alt="checkout page example" width="640" height="567" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-sierra-designs-2.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-sierra-designs-2-300x266.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-sierra-designs-2-750x664.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">See that button in there that allows users at this stage to calculate total order cost. Include that. Here’s what that looks like.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-sierra-designs.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20626" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-sierra-designs.png" alt="best ecommerce checkout page example 2017" width="640" height="740" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-sierra-designs.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-sierra-designs-300x347.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-sierra-designs-750x867.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Another key part of this is the process of adding an item to cart, which should again be a very clean experience that doesn’t impact the user’s journey by taking them straight to the cart page when they’re wanting to purchase another item.</p>
<p class="p1">Two really good examples of this are <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/flash-tattoos/">Flash Tattoos</a> and Erdem.</p>
<p class="p1">Flash Tattoos displays a modal window when an item is added to cart. This window lets the brand cross-sell to increase AOV and conversion rate, but doesn’t force a user into the cart just yet.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-flash-tattoos.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20624" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-flash-tattoos.png" alt="" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-flash-tattoos.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-flash-tattoos-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-flash-tattoos-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Erdem doesn’t provide a pop-up, but instead notifies the user of an item added in the right hand corner column of the site.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-erdem.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20625" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-erdem.png" alt="" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-erdem.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-erdem-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-erdem-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How to Write a Returns Policy That Sells</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/create-a-returns-and-exchanges-policy-that-sells/">Be customer-centric. Also, use this template.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">4. Data validation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">This tactic helps to address issue #3, #5, #9 and #10 in our abandoned cart list above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">From experience, address validation solutions are a great way to speed up the checkout process and also reduce input errors.</p>
<p class="p1">This has been a fairly common addition to checkouts in recent years and PCA Predict in particular has done a great job in creating an easy to integrate, robust solution. Many web browsers like Chrome and Safari also store this information for user’s on their own end, which looks like this:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-auto-fill.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20620" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-auto-fill.png" alt="" width="640" height="303" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-auto-fill.png 1414w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-auto-fill-300x142.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-auto-fill-750x355.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>All of those yellow slots were filled in by Chrome.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Also, it’s helpful for international merchants to use a service or platform that allows you to recognize IP address and automatically change currency to fit the bill.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is an online record store based in The Netherlands. As you can see, the currency alters based on IP address (this user was visiting from the U.S.).</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-vinyl-express.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20619" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-vinyl-express.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-vinyl-express.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-vinyl-express-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-vinyl-express-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In addition, the payment options altered based on IP address using Adyen. In The Netherlands, Ideal is the most common payment option. In the U.S., regular credit card providers and PayPal are most popular. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/vinyl-express/">Vinyl Express</a> set up rules on the backend of their store through Adyen to enable this and decrease customer confusion or distractions.</p>
<h2 class="p3">5. Display trust signals throughout the checkout process</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">This tactic helps to address issue #6 in our abandoned cart list above.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="p6">Trust Seals</h3>
<p class="p1">Users really start to think about security when they reach the most sensitive parts of a webpage. For online shoppers, it’s when they reach the credit card form field on a webpage that they are on guard in terms of the of what the security of a page is actually like.</p>
<p class="p1">Showing trust signals throughout the buyer journey is something that comes across as very obvious, but isn’t always implemented on websites.</p>
<p class="p1">I recommend displaying the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Merchant reviews / rating (e.g. rated 4.9 / 5 based on 100,000 orders)</li>
<li class="p1">SSL certificate and mention of secure shopping experience. You could also potentially look at third party security validation, such as Norton, McAfee, GeoTrust etc</li>
<li class="p1">Very clear customer service / help, returns and T&amp;Cs links</li>
<li class="p1">Logos of available payment options (and ideally payment certification &#8211; e.g. verified by Visa)</li>
<li class="p1">Any other business accreditations</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">Which trust seals should you use?</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/perceived-security-of-payment-form">The Baymard Institute</a> has done two studies on which trust seals invoke the highest amount of security for users. Their first test was in 2013 and the second in 2016. They compared all sorts of seals –– including ones from the Better Business Bureau and Google’s own Trusted Store seal, as well as those from SSL vendors like Symantec, Comodo, Thawte, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">What they saw was that consumer facing security brands score a lot higher in terms of perceived trust –– and not just 2% higher, but 2x.</p>
<p class="p1">What is a consumer-facing security brand? It is often those brands which provide antivirus software like Norton/Symantec and McAfee, as well as Google and the BBB, that rank really highly in a user&#8217;s perceived level of trust. Pure-play SSL providers like GeoTrust, Comodo and Thwate generally don’t do as well –– likely because consumers haven’t heard of them.</p>

<h3 class="p6">Streamlined Domain Experience</h3>
<p class="p1">Another important thing retailers can do to establish trust at the checkout page is to keep customers on their domain through the entirety of the shopping experience.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll see that some websites across the web will jump you to a third-party checkout provider, rather than keeping the customer on their own domain. This is often because the business hasn’t purchased an SSL and is using a shared SSL through a third-party. While this is secure technically, from a perception angle, it can disrupt the user flow and cause distrust.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is how the checkout flow works for brands using their own SSL:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-domain-checkout.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20618" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-domain-checkout.png" alt="" width="640" height="329" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-domain-checkout.png 1309w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-domain-checkout-300x154.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-domain-checkout-750x386.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-domain-checkout-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20616" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-domain-checkout-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="339" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-domain-checkout-1.png 1307w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-domain-checkout-1-300x159.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-domain-checkout-1-750x397.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Free SSL at Checkout Coming Soon to All</h3></p>
<p class="p1">All BigCommerce stores are outfitted at launch with a shared SSL certificate by default, which uses the .mybigcommerce.com domain. As a result, your secure pages, like the cart and checkout page, will have a URL containing store-xxxxxx.mybigcommerce.com.</p>
<p class="p1">To display your store&#8217;s custom domain continuously throughout the checkout process (which is often preferred by shoppers concerned about security) you can purchase a dedicated SSL certificate. In the coming months, BigCommerce customers will have access to a <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/SSL-Overview">free SSL certificate</a>, removing the need to purchase an SSL for checkout domain continuity.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">6. Allow for different payment options</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">This tactic helps to address issue #9 and #10 in our abandoned cart list above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Another key thing to think about are the payment options you’re providing to customers, which has become a much bigger area in the last couple of years.</p>
<p class="p1">Lots of the larger retailers are now offering things like pay after delivery, credit (either with 0% API or at a cost), split payments, etc, which are gradually becoming more important to users.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Klarna</h3>
<p class="p1">Finance in particular is an interesting one. I’ve recently looked at Klarna with a number of clients, which is an excellent solution. The below example shows the UI of Klarna checkout on the ZenProAudio.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-klarna-zen-pro-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20631" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-klarna-zen-pro-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="410" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-klarna-zen-pro-2.png 1288w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-klarna-zen-pro-2-300x192.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-klarna-zen-pro-2-750x480.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><em>Product page</em></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-klarna-zen-pro.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20633" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-klarna-zen-pro.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-klarna-zen-pro.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-klarna-zen-pro-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-klarna-zen-pro-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><em>Checkout page</em></p>
<p class="p1">There are a number of reasons why I recommend Klarna to merchants. The main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Speed</strong> &#8211; Klarna checkout is rapid and, if you’ve used Klarna before, it remembers your details. It’s a relatively similar experience to PayPal.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Credit offering</strong> &#8211; Klarna have a very strong credit and ‘pay after delivery’ offering, which can have a really big impact on a merchant’s conversion rate.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Experience</strong> &#8211; The full Klarna checkout provides a very nice UX and is basically a very clean, optimized checkout page out of the box.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Klarna + BigCommerce</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/klarna/">Are you a BigCommerce customer? Start using Klarna right now.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">Outside of Klarna, there are lots of other payment methods that could make a difference to your business. Be it something like AliPay, which is very important if you’re selling in Asia, or a finance option if you’re selling high value items.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Adyen</h3>
<p class="p1">For international sellers looking to showcase payment options for particular regions, use a solution like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/adyen/">Adyen</a> that lets you set rules for IP addresses so customers don’t have to scan hundreds of options and can instead choose from their region’s top few.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">All countries have their nuances, which is why it was so important we used Adyen with BigCommerce. Adyen supports a large volume of sales, and allows customers to choose their preferred payment method without cluttering up the checkout flow with a bunch of different payment options.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Rogier van Genugten, CEO at Vinyl Express</div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/adyen-hero.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20644" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/adyen-hero.png" alt="" width="640" height="378" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/adyen-hero.png 1073w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/adyen-hero-300x177.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/adyen-hero-750x443.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Adyen + BigCommerce</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Accept preferred payments worldwide. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/adyen/">Begin using Adyen right now</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p1">Digital Wallets: Apple Pay + Amazon Pay</h3>
<p class="p1">Also, look into digital wallets like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/amazon-pay/">Amazon Pay</a>. For many brands using Amazon Pay at checkout, they have seen conversions skyrocket, with more than 20% of customers choosing Amazon Pay over all other options.</p>
<p class="p1">Digital wallets are particularly impactful for mobile commerce metrics.</p>
<p class="p1">One BigCommerce merchant, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/natomounts/">NatoMounts</a>, had a customer land on the site and checkout in less than 30 seconds thanks to Amazon Pay.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">By building these integrations with companies like PayPal and Amazon, BigCommerce provides non-household brands, like me, instant credibility. This equals a clear path to ~5% conversion rates on mobile with over 80% of sales on mobile.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Brandon Chatham, Founder &amp; CEO of NatoMounts</div></div></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-natomounts.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20634" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-natomounts.png" alt="" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-natomounts.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-natomounts-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/checkout-optimization-natomounts-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>See Why So Many Brands Love Amazon Pay</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ShopTalk-Amazon-Handout-2754-6x9-print-booklet-AK.pdf">What 10+ brands have to say about Amazon Pay, including sales lift in as little as two weeks.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p6">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">All in all, your ecommerce checkout page is the most important part of your online store. You cannot win sales and grow your business if you cannot get consumers to convert.</p>
<p class="p1">This is where trust is the most important. This is also where every small error or distraction can have a serious impact on your bottom line. Get as much feedback on the user experience as you can to identify every possible area where you can reduce friction and optimize your checkout page.</p>
<p class="p1">Streamline your checkout page. Offer all available, convenient solutions for your customers and make checkout the least difficult part of your customer’s ecommerce journey.</p>

<p class="p1">Figuring out the best ways to accept credit cards online and choosing the <em>right</em> payment processor can be overwhelming at the beginning. It is the lifeblood of your ecommerce operation.</p>
<p class="p1">If you can not properly take payments online, you have no business.</p>
<p class="p1">Before we dive into your payment options and how to get started, did you know:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">More than <a href="https://www.internetretailer.com/2015/02/03/online-shoppers-hesitate-buy-because-security-concerns" target="_blank">1/3 of consumers hesitate</a> to shop online because of security concerns.</li>

<p class="p1">Throw in each provider&#8217;s fees, contracts and fine print, and you have a wildly complex decision in front of you. You need to consider a myriad of factors, and how they affect your business. There is no right or wrong answer — only what works best for your unique set of circumstances.</p>

</ul>
<p class="p1">Before we begin, know that there are three types of payment processors: merchant account + payment gateway, all-in-one solutions and simplified credit card processors. Here&#8217;s a quick overview of each.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Merchant Account + Payment Gateway</h2>
<p class="p1">The traditional method for accepting payments online has been a combination of a merchant account and a payment gateway. Providers like SecureNet (USA), Authorize.Net (USA) and eWay (Australia and UK) fall into this category.</p>
<p class="p1">A merchant account is a special kind of business bank account that lets you accept credit card payments.</p>
<p class="p1">An online payment gateway connects your store and your merchant service account, and facilitates the processing of the payment transaction between the various parties involved, including your bank and the card issuer’s bank. Think of it as the digital version of a POS card swipe machine used in brick-and-mortar stores.</p>
<p class="p1">There are fees associated with both the merchant account and payment gateway, but there are a lot of options out there, and some have more competitive transaction fees or don’t charge setup fees.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Payment gateways can also offer greater control over security rules and customization; they may be a better fit for large businesses needing a more tailored solution.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">One thing to note about using a merchant account/payment gateway combo is that you’ll need to apply for both, usually filling out forms and providing some financial information. Processing your applications can take a few days, so you won’t be able to jump right into accepting payments. After both have been approved, you’ll need to connect your account to the gateway and then your gateway to your store. Usually this involves configuring your store with API keys, shared secrets and tokens.</p>
<p class="p1">The benefits to using a payment gateway are that you usually have more handholding and personalized customer service along the way because the providers are large companies with big support organizations. Often you’ll be able to get a person on the phone to answer your questions.</p>
<p class="p1">Payment gateways can also offer greater control over security rules and customization; they may be a better fit for large businesses needing a more tailored solution.</p>
<h2 class="p1">All-in-One Solutions</h2>
<p class="p1">These services, including PayPal and 2Checkout, combine an account and gateway into one solution, which can make setup quicker and easier.</p>
<p class="p1">They allow you to take all major credit cards and usually have favorable transaction rates. Plus most don’t charge monthly or setup fees for basic accounts, although you do have to pay a monthly fee for certain added features on some services.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Services like PayPal make setup quicker and easier. They also allow you to take all major credit cards and usually have favorable transaction rates.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">In the past, one potential downside was that they didn’t always offer a seamless checkout experience. Depending on how your solution was set up, your customers may have been redirected off your site to pay for an order. This is no longer true. With PayPal powered by Braintree and One-Touch technology, you, the business owner, get to decide what your customer’s checkout experience is like.</p>
<p class="p1">And this is important, because PayPal is incredibly popular. It has more than 100 million users and <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/18/paypa-60-percent-of-web-transactions/" target="_blank">powers 60% of online transactions</a>. We recommend combining PayPal with another service — that way shoppers who prefer it can choose it, and those who don’t can have another option.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Credit Card Payment Processing, Simplified</h2>
<p class="p1">Services like Stripe have removed much of the complexity out of <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/accept-credit-cards-and-payments/">taking payments online</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">From a merchant’s perspective, these are very similar to the all-in-one solutions, but they usually integrate seamlessly with your store’s checkout, meaning the shopper never leaves your site. And they can be much quicker to set up — you can start taking various payment methods in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">With these simplified payment processors, there’s no need for a merchant service account or payment gateway, and that translates to fewer fees.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">With these simplified payment processors, there’s no need for a merchant account or payment gateway, and that translates to fewer fees. Rates are competitive with the all-in-one solutions, and most of these new processors also don’t charge setup or monthly fees. The experience is straightforward: the customer credit card is entered, and the payment processed — simple as that.</p>
<p class="p1">One thing to consider before choosing a simplified processor is that you usually don’t get quite the same level of traditional support. They tend to be very easy to use, so you may not need it. But if you do run into a problem with your credit card processing company, most support is done as self service via articles or through email — many of these providers don’t even staff a call center.</p>
<h2 class="p1">10 Questions All Businesses Should Ask a Payment Provider</h2>
<p class="p1">For those looking for a top-level view of the issue, and a speedier read, here are the most important questions to ask a potential payments processing provider before you choose to use their services.</p>
<h3 class="p1">1. Are there different rates or fees associated with different types of cards?</h3>
<p class="p1">Some services charge different fees to process different types of card transactions –– e.g. personal, business, debit and rewards cards –– as well as for different transaction amounts. Make sure you know exactly what you’ll be paying to process each type of transaction.</p>
<h3 class="p1">2. Do you charge “billbacks,” or are all charges related to a transaction billed in the same month?</h3>
<p class="p1">It’s not unusual for a payment processor to entice you by quoting low rates. But sometimes that low rate only applies to certain types of cards (see question one). You may only find out after the fact that many of your transactions during the month didn&#8217;t qualify for that low rate.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, in January, you think you’re getting a 1.7% rate on your credit card transactions, but you processed several rewards cards. Even though you processed the transactions in January, come February, your processor charges you back, or bills you back, a higher rate. Now you have two different statements with two different rates for the same transaction, which makes it much harder to figure out the actual rate you&#8217;re paying.</p>
<h3 class="p1">3. What rates or fees do you charge when I swipe credit cards, enter them manually (key-enter) or accept them online?</h3>
<p class="p1">To compensate for the risk of fraud, processors charge different rates depending on how you process a payment. Because there is less fraud associated with<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>cards that are physically swiped in a terminal (after all, you check IDs, right?), there is usually a lower rate. If someone calls you to buy something and gives you their number over the phone, the chance of foul play goes up a bit, as does the processing fee.</p>
<p class="p1">Online purchases have the highest incidence of fraud, so payment processors cover their risk by charging a higher rate. Make sure you know what those rates are and then figure out how much of each type of processing you’ll do to get a rough blended rate.</p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Do you charge a separate fee for your gateway?</h3>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s pretty common for processors to charge a separate fee for their payment gateway, usually on a per-transaction basis. So in addition to the standard transaction fee –– say 2.9% + $0.30 –– you’ll pay a gateway fee for each transaction.</p>
<h3 class="p1">5. When I refund a transaction, do I get back any of the initial fees?</h3>
<p class="p1">Most credit card processors keep all of the fees for return transactions, and will most likely even charge an additional fee to process the refund. That means you can lose money every time a customer returns something. Be sure you are clear on how this process works, as it should inform your return policy. Many merchants sidestep this cost by issuing store credit for a returned item, rather than a refund.</p>
<h3 class="p1">6. What are the contract terms and are there early termination fees?</h3>
<p class="p1">Most credit card processors impose a contract term for a specific amount of time, often one or two years. Many times, early termination or cancellation fees are part of the agreement. That’ll make it difficult for you to switch processors if you&#8217;re unhappy with how your account is handled.</p>
<h3 class="p1">7. What fees do you charge each month?</h3>
<p class="p1">This question is deceptively simple since some processors might provide you with a seemingly small upfront monthly fee. But be sure to dig deeper — some additional fees might be hidden in the fine print. These can include fees for batch processing or fund transfers from a merchant account to your bank account, as well as statement fees. Processors might &#8220;waive&#8221; some of these fees to get your business, but could add them back in after a promotional period.</p>
<h3 class="p1">8. Is there a monthly minimum processing requirement or fee?</h3>
<p class="p1">Some processors charge a monthly minimum fee, which you&#8217;ll pay if your monthly transaction volume falls below a certain amount. This can be a significant financial pain for early-stage businesses with few monthly credit card transactions.</p>
<h3 class="p1">9. Is there a limit on how much I can process?</h3>
<p class="p1">Many processors limit the amount you can process based on your initial approval with them. Obviously, this can be frustrating if your business grows quickly or has a busy season — not to mention the negative impact that turning down orders will have on your business.</p>
<h3 class="p1">10. What type of support is offered?</h3>
<p class="p1">When your payments hit a snag, will the processor be there to support you until you&#8217;re back up and running? Further, an automated phone system isn’t the same as speaking to a live person, so make sure to ask if they have live customer support. Low rate processing fees don’t mean much if you can’t reach someone to help when you need it most.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="750" height="358" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PayPalHeader.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="Payment Provider" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PayPalHeader.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PayPalHeader-300x143.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p class="p1">Choosing the right payment processor for your business is one of the most important decisions you make when setting up your ecommerce website. And once you’re up and running, ensuring you have the right payment gateway to suit your business only grows in importance.</p>
<p class="p1">To make an informed decision, you’ll need to get caught up on the three Ps of payment processing: players, procedures and pricing.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bNV7RGj71zk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center></p>
<h2 class="p4">Who’s Involved in an Online Payment Transaction?</h2>
<p class="p1">There are three main players when it comes to processing credit and debit card transactions, whether you sell online or in person. On one end is you, the business owner. On the other end is your customer. In between are various technology solutions that connect the two of you.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>You, the merchant:</strong> To <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-accept-credit-card-payments-online/">accept credit card payments</a>, you need to partner with a <em><strong>merchant bank</strong></em> (sometimes called an acquirer) who accepts payments on your behalf and deposits them into a merchant account (<a href="https://home.bluesnap.com/snap-center/blog/merchant-account-vs-payment-gateway/">not the same as a payment gateway</a>) that they provide .</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Your customer:</strong> For your customer to buy and pay for their order, he or she needs a credit or debit card. The bank that approves your customer for the card (and lends him or her the cash to pay you) is called the <em><strong>issuing bank</strong></em>.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>The technology:</strong> In the middle are two technologies that enable you and your customer to transact.
<ul>
<li class="p1">The first is a <em><strong>payment gateway</strong></em>, software that <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/shopping-cart/">links your site’s shopping cart</a> to the card processing network.</li>
<li class="p1">The second is the <em><strong>payment processor</strong></em> (or merchant service), which does all the heavy lifting: moving the transaction through the processing network, sending you a billing statement, working with your bank, etc. Often, your merchant bank is also your payment processor, which helps simplify things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p4">How Payment Transactions Are Processed</h2>
<p class="p1">As a business owner, it’s helpful to understand exactly how money moves from your customer to you.</p>
<p class="p1">There are two stages to payment processing: <strong>the authorization </strong>(approving the sale) and <strong>the settlement</strong> (getting the money into your account).</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s how this transaction occurs:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Your customer buys an item on your site with a credit or debit card.</li>
<li class="p1">That information goes through the payment gateway, which encrypts the data to keep it private before sending it to the payment processor.</li>
<li class="p1">The payment processor sends a request to the customer’s issuing bank asking for the money to pay for your stuff.</li>
<li class="p1">The issuer responds with a yes (approval) or a no (denial).</li>
<li class="p1">If approved, the payment processor tells you the transaction is accepted, and also tells your merchant bank to credit your account.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">This back-and-forth process all takes place within 1–2 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1">The second part of the process (where you get paid!) is the settlement:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">The card issuer sends the funds to your merchant bank, which deposits the money into your account.</li>
<li class="p1">The funds are available. Sometimes, your bank lets you access your money before it’s even sent to them. They also might keep a portion in your account that you can’t touch, just in case there are things returned from customers later (that’s called a reserve, in payments speak).</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">This half of the process can take a few days.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Payment Processing Fees &amp; Policies</h2>
<p class="p1">Now that you understand exactly how you get your money from customers <a href="https://due.com/blog/payments-platform-8-tips-business-owners-looking-right-platform/">via payment processing platforms</a>, let’s address the cost issue.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s no surprise that everyone who touches the transaction wants to get paid, including the issuing bank, the credit card associations (Visa, MasterCard, etc.), the merchant bank and the payment provider.</p>
<p class="p1">At its most basic, every time you process a transaction, you pay several fees:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Interchange:</strong> The issuer gets paid a pre-negotiated percentage of each sale. This fee varies depending on many factors, such as industry, sale amount and type of card used. At last check, there were almost 300 different interchange fees.*</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Assessment:</strong> The credit card association (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) also charges a pre-negotiated percentage fee, called an assessment.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Markup:</strong> Your merchant bank takes a percentage cut by charging you a markup fee, the amount of which also varies by industry, the amount of the sale and your monthly processing volume.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Processing:</strong> The payment processor (who might also be your merchant bank) makes money by charging a fixed-rate fee every time you process a transaction — no matter whether it’s a sale, a decline or return. Plus, it can charge fees for setup, monthly usage and even account cancellation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The above fees are often bundled together, so you can have a tough time figuring out who’s getting what amount of your money.</p>
<p class="p1">Beyond the individual fees themselves, there are three different ways processors can structure them as part of an overall pricing plan:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Flat-rate pricing:</strong> You pay a fixed percent for all transaction volume, no matter what the actual costs are. All of the above fees are baked into this single rate. For example, you are charged a bundled rate of 2.9% of the transaction amount + $0.30 per transaction. On a $100 sale, the fee you pay works out to be $3.20.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Interchange plus pricing:</strong> Your merchant service charges you a fixed fee on top of the interchange — for example, 2% + $0.10 on top of a 1.8% interchange fee. On a $100 sale, that works out to be a $3.90 fee. Remember, too, that there are 300 or so different interchange fees, so the 1.8% can vary wildly.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Tiered pricing:</strong> The processor takes the 300 or so different interchange rates and lumps them into three buckets, or pricing tiers: qualified, mid-qualified and nonqualified. This makes it simpler for you (and them) to understand. However, since the processor defines the buckets however it wants, it can be expensive. As an example, the fees you pay on a $100 sale could range from $2.50 to $3.50, depending on how it has been classified.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">*For more details on credit card interchange fees, read up on how Visa,<a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/about-mastercard/what-we-do/interchange.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> MasterCard</a>,<a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/merchant/streamline-payments/payment-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> American Express</a> and<a href="https://www.discovernetwork.com/en-us/home/data/acqIntchgLanding.html target="> Discover</a> handle them.</p>

<p class="p1">According to the<a href="http://www.acfe.com/occupational-fraud.aspx" target="_blank"> Association of Certified Fraud Examiners</a>, almost 50% of small businesses fall victim to fraud at some point in their business lifecycle, costing them an average of $114,000 per occurrence.</p>
<p class="p1">Aside from phishing and hacking, if you accept a fraudulent payment, you could be held financially responsible for the loss.</p>
<p class="p1">Thankfully, there are steps you can take to help minimize your risk and protect yourself and your customers from digital attacks.</p>
<p class="p1">Below are some online best practices for keeping your store safe from hackers.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Two Types of Online Store Fraud</h2>
<p class="p1">Before we talk about what you can do to minimize your risk and protect your ecommerce store from fraud, it&#8217;s helpful to understand common tactics that scammers use.</p>
<p class="p1">There are many types of online fraud, but they can be broadly categorized in the following two buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Account takeover:</strong> Most ecommerce stores provide customers with accounts that store personal information, financial data and purchase history. Perpetrators often hack into these accounts through phishing schemes. In one of the most common tactics, fraudsters send emails to trick customers into revealing usernames and passwords. They then log into your customers’ accounts, change the passwords and make unauthorized purchases.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Identity theft:</strong> Although most businesses take many precautions to secure customer data, fraudsters still manage to hack into databases and steal usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and other personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Hackers often sell credit card numbers to other scammers, who then open accounts with online retailers and use the stolen numbers to pay for purchases.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__callout post-detail__callout--left"><h3>DDOS and Automated Fraud Detection</h3></p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce employs<a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/hosting/"> hacker deterrent security</a> provisioning, three redundant network architectures and hardware firewalls to protect online stores from cybercrime. For additional security, Sift Science –– the security company behind Airbnb, Uber and Wayfair –– <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/sift-science-fraud-prevention/">is available for customers to install</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">This type of ecommerce fraud is difficult to detect because many people don’t check their credit card statements thoroughly — and because victims typically have no idea that someone opened an online account in their names.</p>
<h2 class="p4">PCI Compliance and Your Ecommerce Store</h2>
<p class="p1">To help businesses protect themselves and their customers from online fraud, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) — a forum of global brands including Visa, MasterCard and American Express — has developed a set of best practices to safeguard consumer data.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/pci-compliance">Complying with these standards, i.e. PCI compliance</a>, is not optional for online retailers and is strictly enforced.</p>
<p class="p1">While many of the following recommendations fall within the PCI standards, visit the<a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/merchants/index.php"> PCI Security Standards website</a> for full requirements.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, know that your payment processor can help you with — or completely handle — PCI compliance. Many payment processors, including <a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/paypal/">PayPal</a> and BigCommerce, build PCI compliance into the solutions they offer businesses of all sizes.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Recommended Posts</h3></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p4">Managing Your Risk</h2>
<p class="p1">Although <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/protect-your-online-store-fraud/">the potential for fraud</a> is high for online transactions, you don’t have to concede and accept it as a business cost.</p>
<p class="p1">By putting the right tools and processes in place, you can reduce your chances of an attack, keep both your business and your customers safe, and reduce your chances of losing revenue and drowning in <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/minimize-disputes-and-chargebacks/">chargeback fees</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Below are a few recommendations from the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security" target="_blank">PayPal Security Center</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Monitor Transactions and Reconcile Bank Accounts Daily</h2>
<p class="p1">Nobody knows your business as well as you do. You know your biggest spenders and their buying patterns. Monitor your accounts and transactions for red flags such as inconsistent billing and shipping information, as well as the physical location of your customers. Use tools that track customer IP addresses <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/sift-science-fraud-prevention/">and alert you</a> to any addresses from countries known as a base for fraudsters.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, check to see if your customers are using free or anonymous email addresses (such as Gmail or Yahoo), as there’s a much higher incidence of fraud coming from free email service providers than from paid. For more information, check out the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/fraud/internet_fraud" target="_blank">FBI’s Common Fraud Schemes</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Consider Setting Limits</h2>
<p class="p1">Based on your order and revenue trends, set limits for the number of purchases and total dollar value you’ll accept from one account in a single day. This can help keep your exposure to a minimum should fraud occur.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Use the Address Verification System (AVS)</h2>
<p class="p1">Address Verification Systems compare the numeric parts of the billing address stored on a credit card to the address on file at the credit card company. AVS is a fraud tool included in most payment processing solutions but check with your payment processor to be sure it&#8217;s supported.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Require the Card Verification Value (CVV)</h2>
<p class="p1">You’re most likely familiar with this three- or four-digit security code printed on the backside of credit cards. What you might not know is that PCI rules prevent you from storing the CVV along with the credit card number and card owner’s name. That’s why the CVV is so effective. It is virtually impossible for scammers to get it unless they’ve stolen the physical credit card. Most processors include a tool to require CVV as part of their checkout templates. Use it.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Get Tougher with Password Requirements</h2>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__callout post-detail__callout--left"><h3>Align with PayPal — The Safer Way to Sell</h3></p>
<p class="p1">PayPal thinks shopping should be fun — and fraud-free. Learn more about how PayPal helps keep <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security" target="_blank">consumers and businesses safe</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">Hackers employ sophisticated programs that can run through all the permutations of a password. It won’t take them long to crack a simple, four-character password (such as “abcd”). Best practices these days call for at least an eight-character, alphanumeric password that requires at least one capitalization and one special character (for example, “P0r$che9!!”). Your customers might grumble, but it’s better safe than hacked.</p>
<p class="p1">Let your customers know exactly why you require better passwords, and it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll gain some loyalty points for being upfront and customer-focused. A little extra messaging can go a long way toward <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/6-ways-to-drive-lifetime-value-with-effective-email-marketing/">building customer lifetime value</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Keep Platforms and Software Up to Date</h2>
<p class="p1">Make sure you’re running the latest version of your operating system, as providers continually update their software with security patches to protect you from newly discovered vulnerabilities, as well as the latest viruses and malware.</p>
<p class="p1">Likewise, install and regularly update business-grade anti-malware and anti-spyware software to prevent attacks that exploit outdated software vulnerabilities. Free, limited-feature and consumer-strength antivirus software are not sufficient.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Note:</strong> If your site is hosted on a managed solution, such as BigCommerce, automatic security patches help ensure that any vulnerabilities are quickly resolved.</em></p>

<p class="p1">If you have any doubts that <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/sell-internationally/">international ecommerce and selling globally</a> is a significant opportunity for your business, just look at the numbers.</p>
<p class="p1">A recent <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/globalization/global_flows_in_a_digital_age" target="_blank">McKinsey study</a> estimated that 1.8 billion people will enter the consuming class by 2025, annually spending $30 trillion. With broader internet availability, buyers will have better access to businesses all over the world — businesses just like yours.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">First Things First: Put a Plan in Place</h2>
<p class="p1">Before you open your doors to the world, you need a plan.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’re new to the international ecommmerce game, you may want to start small by selling a few items in a few markets. Once you’ve tested some key products and markets and feel ready to expand, you can invest more heavily.</p>
<p class="p1">Whatever your starting point, here are three critical areas of planning, along with resources that can help you prepare.</p>
<h2 class="p4">1. Find Your Target Markets</h2>
<p class="p1">Like any new venture, it pays to do your homework. Your first step is to learn about who your international customers are, what they buy and how they shop.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Gather Market Intelligence</h3>
<p class="p1">Start by looking at your internal data to see from which countries people are already buying your products. Try further expanding your reach into these markets, even if only to test selling specific products.</p>
<p class="p1">You can also leverage research tools available from government agencies like the <a href="https://www.sba.gov/exportbusinessplanner" target="_blank">U.S. Small Business Administration</a> and<a href="http://www.export.gov/industry/index.asp" target="_blank"> Export.gov</a>. Both offer free planning tools and downloadable templates to help you find the best markets for your products, develop pricing strategies and more.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Research Demand and Local Buying Trends</h3>
<p class="p1">To help develop your target markets, research the top countries that have strong demand for your products or niche specialty. Is there demand or a gap in the market? While you’re at it, try to learn as much as you can about consumers’ spending patterns and from which countries they typically buy. For instance, online shoppers from smaller countries are probably more likely to make international purchases, and they’ll likely spend in larger international markets like the U.S., Canada and Australia.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__callout post-detail__callout--left"></p>
<p class="p1">A helpful resource is <a href="http://www.paypal.com/passport" target="_blank">PayPal’s PassPort site</a>, which has a wealth of information about global buying trends for specific countries.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">For instance, you can see top shopping categories, how often shoppers purchase from countries like the U.S., buying motivations and potential barriers by country. It also summarizes the local customs, trends, taboos and even holidays of each country so your brand offers a truly localized shopping experience for customers.</p>
<h2 class="p4">2. Consider Different International Payment Methods</h2>
<p class="p1">With your initial market research out of the way, start thinking about <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-accept-credit-card-payments-online/">how you&#8217;ll accept payments</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">This is an important step because checkout is the point at which international shoppers tend to abandon their purchases — either because their preferred payment method isn’t available or because they don’t feel confident their payment will be handled securely.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Research Local Buyers’ Preferred Payment Methods</h3>
<p class="p1">These vary significantly <a href="http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/9387-7-tips-for-global-ecommerce" target="_blank">depending on the country</a>, and it’s important to find out what’s best for the markets in which you’re selling. For example, 60% of payments are by direct debit in the Netherlands, while Germans make 46% of payments by online bank transfer.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">60% of payments are by direct debit in the Netherlands, while Germans make 46% of payments by online bank transfer.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">In general, people prefer paying in a familiar currency, ideally their local currency. Some <a href="https://www.bitbond.com/resources/payment-processors/">global payment providers</a> will let you list products in a number of different currencies. If that’s a tool your provider offers, use it. If you’re not offering payment in local currency, make sure to give a currency conversion so customers can see what they’re paying.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Choose a Payment Provider with a Reputation for Security</h3>
<p class="p1">Look for a payment provider with a strong global reputation. PayPal, for instance, consistently ranks among the top payment methods for international payments because of its security, purchase protection and ease of use across multiple devices.</p>
<p class="p1">PayPal gives businesses access to local funding methods without the hassle of opening multiple merchant accounts overseas. You can take payments from over 200 markets in 25 currencies. And it’s already built into the BigCommerce platform, so setup is easy.</p>
<h2 class="p4">3. Plan Your Market Entry</h2>
<p class="p1">You have a couple of options for entering a new market — from starting small on an existing online marketplace to optimizing your current website or setting up a local web presence in particular countries.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Start Small on an Existing Online Marketplace</h3>
<p class="p1">Established sites like eBay can often give you better reach for lower cost. They allow you to test demand for your products before committing a large sum to redeveloping your existing site. Also, <a href="http://bigcommerce.com/blog/multi-channel-selling">consider other online marketplaces</a> that may be popular in your target market.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Optimize Your Current Website</h3>
<p class="p1">A slightly more advanced option is to optimize your existing website for international buyers. You can start by simply highlighting your ability to accept international orders with information on countries served and the shipping costs.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you have more experience, you can look into listing your products in local currencies for shoppers with non-U.S. IP addresses, and maybe eventually install a multi-language toggle for your website.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Create a Custom Website for Certain Markets</h3>
<p class="p1">The most advanced option is to build a website designed to appeal to specific overseas customers.</p>
<p class="p1">This can include investing in a local domain name.</p>
<p class="p1">The products and strategies that work in the U.S. may not necessarily work in other countries, so a targeted website gives you full flexibility to try out different items and presentation. If you take this route, just <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization-site-speed/">remember to test and optimize the experience</a> so you can make sure that elements like text translation, currency conversion and delivery cost calculation work correctly.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Your Future Customers are Waiting</h2>
<p class="p1">Like traveling abroad, selling abroad is an adventure that has the potential to be transformative to your career and your business. It will expose your company to new countries, cultures and, most importantly, customers. So don’t be afraid to take your first step in selling across international borders.</p>

<p class="p1">The majority of sale transactions happen smoothly, working much like this: the sale is authorized by the customer’s card issuer, you ship the merchandise to them and get paid.</p>
<p class="p1">Once in awhile, though, the customer may file a dispute, asking their credit card company to reverse the transaction.</p>
<p class="p1">Why does this occur and what can you do to either prevent the issue or turn a frustrated customer into a repeat buyer?</p>
<p class="p1">Below are the details behind what is most often a misunderstanding between a buyer and a brand, and how to turn a mistake into a learning opportunity.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Why Do Payment Disputes Occur?</h2>
<p class="p1">A buyer may file a dispute for one of three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Item not received:</strong> The buyer claims they ordered and paid for an item but didn’t receive it.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Item significantly not as described:</strong> In this type of claim, the buyer says the item they received is significantly different than they expected, based on the seller’s description. For example, maybe the buyer ordered a red sweater, but received a blue one instead.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Unauthorized transactions:</strong> A buyer claims that a purchase was made without his or her knowledge or consent. Or the buyer was charged twice for the same item.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">When these things happen, buyers may take action by opening a dispute and asking their credit card issuer to reverse the charge.</p>
<p class="p1">This process is referred to by credit card companies as a chargeback. The credit card company will contact your merchant bank, who’ll ask you to clarify the dispute.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Tips to Prevent Disputes and Chargebacks</h2>
<p class="p1">There are several things you can do to help avoid disputes and chargebacks from happening in the first place.</p>
<p class="p1">Below are the industry best practices to avoid and handle disputes.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Provide contact information:</strong> Buyers may not resort to a dispute or chargeback if they can talk to you directly about an issue. Provide an email address or phone number, or even call buyers in advance if you&#8217;re selling higher priced items.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Be responsive:</strong> No one likes to wait, so do your best to respond quickly and professionally to all reasonable buyer inquiries.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Suggest dispute resolution:</strong> If a customer tells you that they intend to file a chargeback with their credit card company, try to resolve the issue first. Some processors like PayPal offer a resolution center where buyers can open a dispute, giving you a forum to work with the buyer so the issue doesn’t escalate.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Provide a clear return policy:</strong> Make sure your <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/create-a-returns-and-exchanges-policy-that-sells/">return and refund policies</a> are easy to find and understand. If customers claim they couldn’t locate the return policy, it can be to your disadvantage, not theirs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Beyond these industry best practices, there are additional methods for offering customers a positive brand experience when something goes wrong with an order.</p>
<p class="p1">Try the easy steps below to provide excellent customer service in the face of disputes or chargebacks.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Preventing “Item Not Received” Chargeback Claims</h2>
<p class="p1">Here’s how to avoid or minimize losses when your customer doesn’t receive an item.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Give buyers realistic delivery dates:</strong> Realistic dates can help prevent customers from prematurely filing disputes.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Ship with online tracking:</strong> Use a shipping service that provides online tracking to help confirm that an item was delivered. Standard shipping receipts only show that an item was shipped. If the total sale is over $200, require a signature to confirm that your customer received an order. The nominal expense is well worth it.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Order shipping insurance:</strong> Too many things can go wrong in transit. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to purchase shipping insurance for items that are fragile or expensive. You’ll be covered if an item is lost or damaged, plus it includes tracking and delivery information so a customer can see that the order is en route. Insurance will also alert you when a package is delivered. In case of a shipping problem, just file an insurance claim with the shipping company.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Be aware of insurance exceptions:</strong> Liability for loss or damage may be limited depending on the type of package, the declared value and/or the shipping company. Talk to your shipper to ensure proper coverage.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Delay shipping high-risk orders:</strong> Delay the shipment of new orders that are expensive and in demand for 24 to 48 hours, especially <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/international-ecommerce-expansion/">when shipping internationally</a>. Use caution when shipping overnight. Scammers will often ask for overnight shipping so they can resell expensive merchandise as quickly as possible.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Let customers know when something is out of stock:</strong> If an item is out of stock, remove the listing or update it to reflect the out-of-stock status. Provide an estimated in-stock date or clearly indicate that customers who choose an out-of-stock product are placing an advance order. Likewise, if you learn of an issue that might affect shipping times (such as bad weather), let customers know as quickly as possible. That way, they can find answers to questions without even initiating a dispute or calling you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">Prevent “Significantly Not As Described” Claims</h2>
<p class="p1">Here are a few things you can do to help make sure that items meet buyers’ expectations.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Provide pictures and detailed descriptions:</strong> Take photos of products from various angles. Add accurate, detailed descriptions so customers know exactly what they&#8217;re buying.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Give adequate disclosures:</strong> If you’re selling used items, clearly disclose any functional defects or cosmetic damage.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Answer any questions promptly and clearly:</strong> If a buyer does contact you with an issue, being helpful and keeping a positive tone may prevent a small problem from growing into a larger one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">Prevent Unauthorized Transaction Claims</h2>
<p class="p1">Buyers may open a dispute or request a chargeback when they believe that their credit or debit card was used without their permission. Sometimes this may be a simple mistake or misunderstanding, e.g. the buyer forgot they made the purchase or a family member authorized to use the account made the purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">On rare occasions, this may be an indication of fraud. If so, be sure to follow <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/protect-your-online-store-fraud/">fraud detection best practices</a> to help keep both your customer and your store’s data safe.</p>
<p class="p1">In most cases, the easiest way to settle a dispute is to work with your customer to figure out what happened. Begin the conversation with an open mind, listen to what they have to say and stay focused on a solution. It’s a chance for you to provide great customer service, prevent a possible escalation and turn them into a repeat customer.</p>

<p class="p1">Mobile commerce sales are expected to reach more than $123 billion in 2016, a 39% increase over 2015 and more than double the growth from 2014. In total, mobile commerce will account for nearly one-third of all retail ecommerce sales and 2.6% of total retail sales for the year.</p>
<p class="p1">The vast majority of these sales are occurring on smartphones, on which mobile commerce revenue saw a 95% year-over-year increase in 2015. <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Mcommerces-Rapid-Growth-Primarily-Coming-Smartphones/1013909" target="_blank">eMarketer predicts</a> that the year-over-year growth of smartphone mobile commerce will slow to 50% in 2016, but absolute growth will be roughly the same: hitting $20 billion in additional sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay plays a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/apple-pay-tips-mobile-payments/">major role in this increase in mobile commerce conversion</a> and revenue by removing barriers to checkout. According to a Q1 2016 Forrester report, mobile traffic accounts for 44% of retailer traffic, but only 33% of online sales. Apple Pay has great potential for helping solve cart abandonment.</p>
<p class="p1">Specifically, <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/" target="_blank">Apple Pay</a> removes the need for consumers to manually enter or re-enter payment details on small screens. Instead, consumers can use the Apple Pay option and verify their identity using Apple’s TouchID fingerprint technology. When you make a purchase, Apple Pay uses a device-specific number and unique transaction code. So your card number is never stored on your device or our servers, and when you pay, your card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants.</p>
<p class="p1">“The single biggest challenge in mobile conversion stems from the difficulty of entering name, address, and payment details on a mobile device. Apple Pay on the web solves this problem by removing these steps. This eliminates friction and streamlines checkout, thereby saving sales that would otherwise be postponed or lost,” said Jimmy Duvall, chief product officer for BigCommerce. “By utilizing Apple Pay on BigCommerce stores, thousands of retailers will benefit from higher <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/conversion-optimization/">conversion rates</a> and provide their customers a best-in-class shopping experience.”</p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-17313" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/iphone.png" alt="iphone" width="458" height="640" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/iphone.png 458w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/iphone-300x419.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></center></p>
<p class="p1">Larger companies like WayFair and RetailMeNot are already seeing the upward revenue trajectory of mobile-ready consumers, and are preparing for a smartphone future.</p>
<p class="p1">“Over the past year we’ve seen consumers’ willingness to purchase on mobile increase a lot, to the point where the share of transactions taking place on the smartphone has doubled since late 2014,” Bob Sherwin, senior director of acquisition at ecommerce furniture company Wayfair, told eMarketer.</p>
<p class="p1">Tablets currently make up little more than half of all mobile commerce sales, but that is expected to change by 2017, when smartphones capture the majority of the market.</p>
<p class="p1">“Tablets are still growing but at a lesser extent than we’ve seen in the past,” Marissa Tarleton, CMO of North America at digital coupon marketplace RetailMeNot, told eMarketer. “As we partner with our retailers, we’re optimizing for smartphones.”</p>
<p class="p1">By 2020, smartphones will capture $129.44 billion of all retail mobile commerce outlays in the U.S., a growth rate of 18.3%. And smaller and mid-size brands should not be excluded from that share of revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">As mid-market brands continue to build their businesses and market to their target audiences, world-class on-site checkout experiences are mere customer expectations. BigCommerce will enable all growing brands on its platform the ability to offer their customers new, trusted technology that solves for frictioned experiences.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Stay tuned for more product announcements similar to <a href="http://bigcommerce.com/apple-pay/" target="_blank">Apple Pay</a> over the coming months as BigCommerce ramps up to provide a full <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">omnichannel suite</a> of tools to future-proof growing brands for the next wave of online business.</strong></em></p>

Now discover how you and your customers can benefit.</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay will be here <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/" target="_blank">before the holidays</a>. Is your business ready? Have you even thought through the potential impact?</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/apple-pay-integration/">Apple Pay is a next generation checkout solution</a> aimed at solving one of the biggest mobile commerce pain points: checkout frustration.</p>
<p class="p1">Inserting payment information on small screens is difficult, cumbersome, and time consuming. Neither the customer nor merchant win in that scenario.</p>
<p class="p1">This is why most mobile commerce transactions today <a href="https://www.internetretailer.com/2016/02/17/smartphones-might-eclipse-tablets-m-commerce-sales-next-year" target="_blank">occur on tablet</a> –– not smartphone.</p>
<p class="p1">But Apple Pay is very likely to change that. AirBnB, Fancy and Target have all already seen success with Apple Pay for mobile conversions. Soon, Apple will release the technology to the rest of the industry, likely forever altering mobile commerce as we know it.</p>
<p class="p1">This could be the tipping point of the mobile commerce boom –– and this time, smartphones will be leading the way.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to seamless transactions, speedy, one-click payments and TouchID technology that decreases fraud, increases consumer trust and removes the need to manually enter detailed payment info, Apple Pay will bring about a new era of retail and finally close the lid on mobile <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-checkout-page-optimization/">checkout conversion issues</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">With its seamlessness and security, Apple is raising the bar on mobile payments for the entire retail industry. Below, you’ll find 21 experts offering their insights and best tips to businesses on why and how to use Apple Pay.</p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Note:</strong> </em>Currently, all iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S and 6S Plus, iPhone SE, iPad Air 2, iPad Pro and Apple Watch customers can take advantage of this technology today. BigCommerce customers can now <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apple-pay/">activate Apple Pay for their stores</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Allen Burt, Founder &amp; CEO, <a href="http://bluestout.com/" target="_blank">Blue Stout</a></h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17222" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/apple-pay-allen-burt.jpg" alt="Allen Burt" width="750" height="509" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/apple-pay-allen-burt.jpg 764w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/apple-pay-allen-burt-300x203.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/apple-pay-allen-burt-750x509.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s going to be game-changing. One of the major hindrances to mobile buying has always been the checkout. It&#8217;s easy to browse, it&#8217;s easy to add-to-cart, but the checkout process has always been cumbersome on mobile. Apple Pay will streamline the checkout and make it easier.</p>
<p class="p1">My advice for ecommerce companies wanting to explore Apple Pay is first take a peek into your mobile traffic, especially your mobile <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">abandonment rate</a>. Once you get some data around this, you can be informed about making a decision to integrate your ecommerce website with Apple Pay (currently only the Safari browser supports Apple Pay for desktop).</p>
<p class="p1">If you do decide to move forward with offering this payment method to your customers and integrating it into your website, you&#8217;ll need to make it obvious!</p>
<p class="p1">Offering Apply Pay could even be an incentive for customers to purchase if they know they don&#8217;t have to waste time entering their payment information. So, visually display the fact your website supports Apple Pay and include it in your marketing strategy to educate and incentivize users to use it as their payment method.</p>

<p class="p1">NFC payments like Apple Pay are the the most secure payment method out there. Apple Pay contains multiple layers of dynamic encryption and is also protected by TouchID, Apple’s fingerprint technology.</p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay is also the fastest and most convenient way to pay — which is why it’s important to accept it this holiday season. Apple Pay transactions happen near instantaneously (as opposed to chip cards, which can take several seconds to process). So to provide the best (and most secure) customer experience throughout the holidays, it’s a smart strategy to implement a POS in your brick and mortar that can accept Apple Pay ASAP.</p>

<p class="p1">Apple Pay is an absolute game changer for small business and, dare I say, one of Amazon.com&#8217;s biggest threats.</p>
<p class="p1">When a customer can checkout on any website with Apple Pay simply by using TouchID, that creates a frictionless checkout and evens the playing field for all merchants.</p>
<p class="p1">The biggest questions that customers face when shopping online is wondering if the merchant they&#8217;re shopping with is trustworthy: “Will I get my order on time and in good condition?” “How hard will it be to complete the checkout (especially on a mobile device)?”</p>
<p class="p1">Apple Pay resolves both issues by conveying trust and making checkout incredibly easy.</p>

<p class="p1">The benefit is that there is a massive audience of iPhone-owning mobile shoppers who are the earliest adopters of Apple Pay, and not using it will create an additional layer of friction for those mobile conversions. Mobile commerce is still in its infancy (in terms of $$$$) but already accounts for more than 50% of traffic to ecommerce sites. It&#8217;s easy to connect the dots.</p>

<p class="p1">Apple Pay will help you compete, considering Apple is one of the best companies at generating buzz for its new products.</p>
<p class="p1">Some people won’t even consider buying online if an ecommerce store doesn’t have a PayPal button. Apple Pay could easily end up in the same situation.</p>
<p class="p1">Apple has done a wonderful job of making partnerships with major credit card companies and retail stores, so it’s not that crazy to think that NFC-based payment methods will end up being the norm.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s also worth mentioning that Apple Pay should help shrink the divide between online and offline sales, since customers can use it for both types of purchases. Therefore, you may end up getting better sale management options along with more sales in general.</p>

<p class="p1">Apple Pay reduces friction with the payment process and is more secure than other payment</p>
<p class="p1">methods. Apple Pay uses biometrics and does not require a credit card to be present, thus reducing the risk of stolen card numbers.</p>
<p class="p1">Although Apple Pay requires an iPhone 6 or later and the adoption rate has been a bit slow so far, it has been increasing. You can be sure that Apple will continue pushing this payment solution and that more users will adopt as they upgrade their phones.</p>

<p class="p1">Apply Pay is a solution to those low mobile conversions. Typing in address and credit card info is an awful experience on desktop, never mind mobile devices. Add to that the fact that most people are on the go while using their mobile device and it&#8217;s not hard to understand why mobile conversions remain so low. Adding Apple Pay gives your customers a frictionless way to instantly make a purchase without thinking twice about it.</p>

<p class="p1">Apple Pay is truly frictionless commerce geared to increasing mobile transactions.</p>
<p class="p1">My advice to retailers would be to run a thorough mobile UX audit and deliver a truly mobile first user experience to shoppers and customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that the mobile checkout has been more or less ‘fixed’ with Apple Pay (with Android Pay to follow), mobile devices will becoming the primary de facto online shopping device.</p>

<p class="p1">Every time you add a payment solution, you make it easier for a related customer segment to buy and improve their conversion rates. If you offer an impulse buy product, have a lot of mobile shoppers, or have items with lower AOVs, the Apple Pay user segment is probably not insignificant. Go get them!</p>

<p class="p1">Right now, the greatest reason for the disparity between mobile and desktop conversion rates lies in the checkout friction on mobile. Mobile checkout is often super painful.</p>
<p class="p1">Once Apple Pay is supported on the Safari mobile browser, this could be huge for iPhone users. This is a coveted segment for merchants since iPhone users consistently spend more online than owners of other devices by a huge margin.</p>

<p class="p1">Speed and trust: the less info you need a consumer to enter on your site, the more likely it is that they will complete the transaction with you. Services like Apple Pay help take that mental roadblock of manually giving you their credit card info out of the equation. Really, it is all about convenience.</p>

<p class="p1">The hardest part of any retail business is optimizing your customer journey. What that means is improving the satisfaction and happiness a customer feels when they interact with your store (online or brick-and-mortar).</p>
<p class="p1">The logistics of payment can often be an overlooked bit of friction in that journey. Electronic wallets and payment platforms like Apple Pay, which streamline payment into one-click, can be a great ally in removing those final bits of friction in your customer journey.</p>

<p class="p1">There are a ton of &#8220;tech-ie&#8221; shoppers out there that love to be a part of paying with Apple Pay. Even many fast food chains are using it at the drive-thru and I myself, as an Apple watch owner, find it cool to be a part of the trend. This is just be another way to increase the odds for more sales as a business owner.</p>

<p class="p1">Apple Pay can be very beneficial, but you have to know your audience. As a starter, you probably don&#8217;t want to have seven different payment buttons (like Amazon, Visa, PayPal, etc), so A/B test which combination of payment buttons works best for your audience.</p>
<p class="p1">You could also get a good idea if this would be beneficial to try out on your site by looking into your Google Analytics reports to find out the number of iOS devices visiting and purchasing on your website.</p>

<p class="p1">With mobile ecommerce rates rising sharply, Apple Pay will give consumers using Safari an easy route to complete a transaction. This will offer a huge time saving to those customers that have set up Apple Pay, increasing the likelihood of conversion this holiday season as the program rolls out for those users.</p>
<p class="p1">Since Apple Pay is currently limited to Safari, it is possible to use browser recognition to display advertisements and special promotions only to users on Safari regarding your store&#8217;s ability to accept Apple Pay that are not shown to users of other browsers.</p>
<p class="p1">This provides an opportunity to capitalize on this new audience and convenience feature without forfeiting critical holiday advertising real estate for users that are ineligible for Apple Pay.</p>

<p class="p1">Customers worldwide are using their mobile devices for online shopping more often. Depending on who you want to believe, it’s estimated that since late-2014 more than 50% of all online purchases are made from mobile devices. Apple / iOS has about a 15% market share of mobile devices, which is a huge potential user base for Apple Pay.</p>
<p class="p1">The attraction (to the customer) of Apple Pay is the convenience of already having their credit card details on their Apple devices. They’re also already familiar with spending money on their Apple devices (even if it’s just via iTunes or the App Store).</p>
<p class="p1">We are also seeing a trend where customers are spending more dollars when they can act impulsively and with a low-level of friction. Think about how easy Amazon makes this with their 1-Click Purchases.</p>
<p class="p1">For this very reason, I’d recommend that all online retailers offer Apple Pay as a payment option at checkout, because it makes it easier for customers to spend money with you.</p>

<p class="p1">Removing friction from the checkout process is always a good idea. It decreases cart abandonment and stimulates more impulse sales. However, it&#8217;s best to offer it as an alternative and not the only way to make a payment since most users –– at least for now –– will go for the good old credit card.</p>

<p class="p1">I&#8217;m on the fence about it. If it&#8217;s important to your business to be seen as a tech early adopter, or if it&#8217;s expected from your audience, then yeah, you should have it. But for most small businesses, the POS device and transaction costs just don&#8217;t make sense. I&#8217;d hold off in most cases until the demand grows.</p>

<p class="p1">Obviously, consumers are nervous about credit card security so offering the many payment choices is a good idea. Apple Pay means they don’t even have to pull out their credit card at a register.</p>

<p class="p1">If you’ve been contacted by your bank or financial institution lately only to discover that your credit card information has been compromised, then you’ve felt the growing frustration many consumers face today. The situation with respect to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/protect-your-online-store-fraud/">credit card fraud is only getting worse</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Dealing with a compromise is a time-consuming hassle from a consumer’s perspective; particularly because many of us maintain large numbers of (supposedly secure) personal online profiles that afford us a convenient way to deal with recurring monthly or annual payments.</p>
<p class="p1">How can we be sure that these <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/payments-provider-101/'">online service providers</a>, who so readily <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-accept-credit-card-payments-online/">accept and retain our credit card information</a>, are taking the appropriate measures to secure it?</p>
<p class="p1">This is the purpose of PCI DSS –– and every retailer is required to comply. Depending on the ecommerce technology and backend a retailer uses, and how their payment systems are architected, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/secure-web-hosting/">PCI compliant hosting</a> can be an easy check on a long list of things retailers need to do to ensure their customers are transacting securely, or it can be a big pain –– costing ample time, resources and money.</p>
<p class="p1">In this guide, you’ll learn what PCI DSS is, how to achieve it for your business and how your ecommerce backend plays a large role in your required effort.</p>

<p class="p5"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16935" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero.jpg" alt="pci-compliance-section-hero" width="750" height="400" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero.jpg 1562w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero-300x160.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero-750x400.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The<a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/"> PCI Security Standards Council</a> (PCI SSC) defines a series of specific Data Security Standards (DSS) that are relevant to all merchants who accept credit card, regardless of their revenue and annual credit card transaction volumes. It was established by the payment card industry to ensure that online merchants meet a set of strict standards. PCI DSS compliance is mandatory for businesses that process online payments.</p>
<h3 class="p3">What is PCI Compliance?</h3>
<p class="p1">Achieving and maintaining PCI compliance is the ongoing process an organization undertakes to ensure that they are adhering to the security standards defined by the PCI SSC.</p>
<p class="p1">The SSC defines and manages the standards, while compliance to them is enforced by the credit card companies themselves. Again, these standards apply to all organizations that deal with cardholder data.</p>
<p>The PCI DSS breaks account data into two separate categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cardholder data includes</strong>: the Primary Account Number (PAN), Cardholder Name, Expiration Date and Service Code.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive Authentication Data includes:</strong> Full track data (magnetic-stripe data or equivalent on a chip), CAV2/CVC2/CVV2/CID, and PINs/PIN blocks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">Credit Card Security: A Neglected Subject in Many Organizations, Including Large Enterprise Establishments</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.jasperstudios.com/">Jasper Studios</a> provides ecommerce development services to omnichannel retailers both large and small and, as such, we have seen every kind of credit card storage transgression imaginable.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ve witnessed cardholder data stored in plain text files without any encryption or basic obfuscation residing under the CFO’s desk in a dusty PC dating back to the late 1990’s –– all freshly captured from an insecure payment gateway in a homegrown ecommerce platform. Could my credit card number have been stored in that dusty old PC? Was yours?</p>
<p class="p1">This sort of practice is plain negligence. Fortunately, however, this isn’t a practice undertaken by most organizations, and when done so, it’s typically caused by unintentional ignorance on the subject. But, these sorts of horror stories still persist today. No wonder so many of our payment cards have been or eventually become compromised.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not just smaller organizations that can have deplorable standards for data security. In 2005, Wal-Mart had a <a href="http://www.wired.com/2009/10/walmart-hack/">serious security breach</a> targeting their point-of-sale systems. An earlier internal audit revealed thousands of customer credit card numbers and other personal data had been found on their servers in unencrypted form. This data may have been compromised during the breach, although that has not been officially confirmed.</p>
<p class="p1">More recently, in 2013, U.S. retail giant Target Corporation <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/19/target-confirms-point-of-sale-data-breach-announces-it-exposed-40-million-credit-card-numbers/">was hacked</a> –– a staggering 40 million credit and debit card numbers were stolen from their network. If this can happen to some of the world’s largest retailers, it can certainly happen to smaller ones, too.</p>

<h3 class="p6">Do I need to ensure PCI Compliance for my organization? Understanding the law</h3>
<p class="p1">If you operate your own on-premise or self-hosted cloud commerce solution, then the short answer is, yes.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style='width:auto;'>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-raised-no-inside-shadow-no-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 2px solid #4E75F8 ; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            BigCommerce takes care of the vast majority of the steps toward PCI compliance for any customer on our platform. With an ecommerce software like Magento, a business will have to pay someone to set up servers and networking and take the steps to secure that infrastructure to get them PCI compliant. Magento is not PCI compliant out of the box. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/dm/switch">Learn about switching platforms here</a>. 
                            </div>
                        </div></p>
<p class="p1">Whether you run a single brick-and-mortar retail location or you are a large organization selling goods across multiple stores and ecommerce sites, anywhere that your credit card merchant account has been connected and integrated requires attention — and compliance violation means an extremely tough penalty at the hands of the payment card industry.</p>
<p class="p1">All credit card transaction volumes your organization processes are aggregated across multiple channels (i.e. in store retail point-of-sale terminals and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/payments/">online payment gateways</a>) and summed up to determine an appropriate PCI compliance level with DSS standards.</p>
<p class="p1">This means a large international retail chain handling six million transactions per year will still be considered a Level 1 merchant (the strictest level) and will be held to the highest of PCI compliance standards, even if their related ecommerce store processes less than 500 orders per month.</p>
<p class="p1">Fortunately, if you operate a SaaS-based ecommerce store and do not have any access to any credit cardholder data (which is the case for most modern SaaS commerce platforms), your need for PCI compliance is greatly mitigated. The heavy lifting has vested expertly and wonderfully in the hands of the technology experts working for the PCI-compliant SaaS companies, which in our professional opinion is exactly where it belongs.</p>
<h3 class="p6">PCI Compliance Requirements: How to Quickly Determine Compliance Level</h3>
<p class="p1">If you host and manage your own ecommerce platform, you will need to ensure PCI compliance for your organization, and the first step is to determine the required compliance level.</p>
<p class="p1">All merchants fall into one of four levels based upon credit or debit card transaction volume over a 12-month period. Level 1 is the strictest in terms of DSS requirements, where Level 4 is the least strict:</p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-16929" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-19-at-5.04.50-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-19 at 5.04.50 PM" width="644" height="264" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-19-at-5.04.50-PM.png 644w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-19-at-5.04.50-PM-300x123.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /></center></p>
<p class="p1">Almost all small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) classify as the lower Level 3 or Level 4 merchant, however, this does not preclude the necessity to maintain compliance with the same diligence as larger organizations.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, it’s a costly misconception encountered amongst SMBs who believe they do not need to worry about compliance at all because they don’t do a significant enough volume of online or in-store sales. Non-compliance is equally as costly as a breach, in which you are required to assess to the Level 1 standard for the next year, including an on-site audit.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style='width:auto;'>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-raised-no-inside-shadow-no-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 2px solid #4E75F8 ; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            BigCommerce’s Cardholder Data Environment is PCI DSS 3.1 Level 1 certified as both a Merchant and a Service Provider. This protects against credit card data breaches and eliminates the significant cost and hassle of compliance. 
                            </div>
                        </div></p>
<h3 class="p6">Penalties for Non-Compliance</h3>
<p class="p1">PCI is not, in itself, a law. It’s a standard that was created by the major card brands including Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express and JCB. The credit card companies typically do not directly handle payment processing functions themselves, but rely on third party processors (such as <a href="https://www.chasepaymentech.com/">Chase Paymentech</a> or <a href="https://www.chasepaymentech.com/">Moneris Solutions</a>) to handle the transactional services.</p>
<p class="p1">Merchants that do not comply with PCI DSS and are involved in a credit card breach may be subject to fines, card replacement costs or incur costly forensic audits. They could also find themselves in the position where they can’t process credit cards, which can be a death knell. The payment card companies, at their discretion, are the ones who administer fines to the merchant’s bank (or similar financial institution, known as the acquirer) and can range between $5,000 – $100,000 per month for PCI compliance violations or breaches.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>&#8220;Most states have breach reporting requirements and small businesses in particular can take a huge reputation hit and loss of business when they are breached,&#8221; says Tim Thomas, Senior Director of Product Management at <a href="https://www.controlscan.com/">ControlScan</a>. </em></p>
<p class="p1">The bank/acquirer in turn passes the fines downstream until it eventually hits the merchant. On top of fines that originate from the credit card companies, merchants may be subject to additional penalties from their bank as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Banks and payment processors may terminate their relationship with the merchant altogether, or simply increase per-transaction processing fees and require the merchant to pay for the replacement of the credit cards that have been compromised in the originating beach.</p>
<p class="p1">What’s arguably worse is that the bank or processor may require the merchant to move up a level in compliance if they are breached, making the adherence requirements all the more onerous on the merchant moving forward.</p>
<p class="p1">Penalties are not openly discussed nor widely publicized, but they can be catastrophic to a business. It is important to be familiar with your credit card merchant account agreement(s), which should fully outline your exposure.</p>
<h3 class="p6">What the PCI Data Security Standards Involve</h3>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&amp;document=pci_dss">full PCI DSS</a> (data security standard) is an extremely dry read, akin to watching paint peel agonizingly off your wall on a hot summer afternoon. It’s a pretty technical subject to cover as well, which is summarized in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="p1">Most of the topics found in the PCI DSS deal with maintaining a professional data storage solution –– i.e. ensuring the security of cardholder data. It includes requirements on securing an internal hosting network, adequately protecting cardholder data, implementing strong user access control measures, managing data security policies, executing a vulnerability management program and performing an external security audit. It also provides detailed instructions on how to complete your own PCI Self-Assessment Questionnaire.</p>
<p class="p1">In all, if you’re a pure play (i.e. online-only) merchant that does not have a physical retail store but you accept, retain or transmit payment card data <a href="http://grow.bigcommerce.com/magento-ecommerce.html">through your own self-hosted ecommerce store</a> (via open source platforms such as: OpenCart, ZenCart, Magento Community Edition, etc.) you should positively familiarize yourself with the PCI Security DSS and understand your required compliance level.</p>
<p class="p1">Consider hiring a qualified external party who is well versed in PCI subject matter and can provide an objective opinion on how to specifically achieve compliance for your organization.</p>
<p class="p1">PCI compliance is its own entire universe of complexity and many organizations don’t have the internal resources qualified enough to delve into its bowels.</p>
<p class="p1">We also recommend obtaining an independent adoption consultant along with a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA). <a href="http://www.paysw.com/">PSC</a> is one such QSA partner who can provide detailed guidance as to how to obtain compliance and also act as an independent auditor to test your internal security.</p>
<h2 class="p3">How to Achieve PCI Compliance for Self-Hosted Ecommerce Solutions</h2>
<p class="p10"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16934" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero-1.jpg" alt="pci-compliance-section-hero-1" width="750" height="400" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero-1.jpg 1562w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero-1-300x160.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero-1-750x400.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">The topic of PCI compliance is immensely important to any online retailer that transmits or stores cardholder data (i.e. credit card or debit card information) in their own, physical on-site servers or remote data farms. Cardholder data that is processed through an online store and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/pos-sell-offline-with-square/">retail point-of-sale system</a> combine to form a single transaction volume used to determine an organization’s merchant compliance level.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style='width:auto;'>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-raised-no-inside-shadow-no-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 2px solid #4E75F8 ; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            Keep in mind that if you are using a SaaS or cloud-based ecommerce technology solution like BigCommerce, your PCI compliance is greatly mitigated through your provider. 
                            </div>
                        </div></p>
<p class="p1">For those not utilizing a SaaS or cloud-based ecommerce technology, the following information outlines the steps you must take in order to ensure that your online business is PCI compliant.</p>
<p class="p1">Your compliance level determines the amount of work you need to do, and the levels are as such:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Levels 1 and 2 are for merchants processing 1,000,000 transactions or more per year</li>
<li class="p1">Level 3 applies to an organization that processes greater than 20,000 credit or debit card transactions per year</li>
<li class="p1">Level 4 applies to an organization that processes less than 20,000 ecommerce transactions per year<em> or</em> less than one million card present transactions</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In the interest of brevity, as this subject is vastly complex, we’ll concentrate on a Level 3 or Level 4 organization.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Self Assessment for PCI Merchant Levels 3 and 4</h3>
<p class="p1">If you are a Level 3 or Level 4 merchant, the <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/index.php">PCI DSS</a> provides you the option of doing an internal assessment, whereby a qualified staff member or corporate officer from your organization can perform his or her own audit and sign-off to produce a formal <a href="http://www.beyondsecurity.com/pci_compliance.html#9">PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance</a> package indicating such.</p>
<p class="p1">The first steps are to determine your required compliance level and then download and review the appropriate <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/merchants/self_assessment_form.php">Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) found on the PCI SSC Website</a>. There are different SAQs for each merchant level and also different related DSS Attestation of Compliance forms for each level as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Before you venture down this path and attempt to download your SAQ and get started, you’ll need to first digest a <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Understanding_SAQs_PCI_DSS_v3.pdf">six page document</a> just to figure out which SAQ form to use in the first place.</p>
<p class="p1">And, if you aren’t thoroughly bored and confused after doing that, you almost certainly will be after referring to the lengthy <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/glossary.php">PCI glossary of acronyms and technical jargon</a> related to the subject.</p>
<p class="p1">In my humble opinion (and also according to the PCI SSC themselves), the best and easiest thing to do here is to contact your merchant bank and have them help you identify which specific documents you need to use. This is an essential step, as they will often point out deviances in the standard PCI DSS they feel may apply in your case.</p>
<p class="p1">Level 3 merchants require quarterly external vulnerability scans by an ASV (Approved Scan Vendor). A list of ASV’s can be found <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/approved_scanning_vendors.php">here</a> and include such companies as Cisco Systems, Alert Logic and Backbone Security to name a few.</p>
<p class="p1">Completing a self-assessment questionnaire for Level 3 and Level 4 merchants is based upon the honor system, much like completing your income tax return. It’s tempting for organizations to guesstimate their way through some answers or outright fabricate them to avoid the human and physical resource expenditures required to correct vulnerabilities. Many frankly don’t understand some of the items on the SAQ to be begin with.</p>
<p class="p1">That said, don’t be dishonest or misrepresent information on the SAQ. If you have a data security breach and your documents come under scrutiny, you can be fined heavily and, in the worst case, your merchant account(s) can be dropped by your bank/financial institution.</p>
<h3 class="p6">PCI Compliance Checklist for 2016: Getting Started</h3>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/index.php">PCI DSS</a> contains what are actually common-sense <a href="http://www.blackstratus.com/blog/practices-maintaining-data-security-business-environment/">general data security best practices</a> for any system administration team that is used to hosting sensitive corporate information in a modern network environment.</p>
<p class="p1">The trouble in reaching compliance begins when an organization does not have experienced enough internal IT/IS departments and can unfortunately discover that their internal hosting environment is wildly insecure and susceptible to both internal snooping by their own staff or they are wide open to outside intrusion.</p>
<p class="p1">Every organization aiming to achieve PCI compliance begins in the same place, and there are three steps in the journey to adhering to the PCI DSS and becoming compliant:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>First, Assess</strong> –– Perform your own audit to identify the cardholder data you are responsible for, take an inventory of your IT assets and business processes for payment card processing and analyze them for vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive cardholder data.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;The discovery aspect is crucial in determining your PCI scope,&#8221;says <a href="https://twitter.com/benrothke">Ben Rothke</a>, a QSA with <a href="https://www.nettitude.com/">Nettitude</a>, Ltd. &#8220;A firm must look under every nook and cranny to uncover every point where credit card data enters a system.  This includes everything from mail order, phone order, drop box, order-entry systems, to applications that process credit card data, order entry systems, and much more.&#8221;  </em></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Next, Remediate</strong> –– Fix the vulnerabilities you discover in priority sequence. Ideally move away from storing cardholder data at all unless you absolutely need to. Many organizations store cardholder data within their own homegrown ecommerce platforms after taking a one-off guest checkout order with no intention of using the information again. In this case, why hold onto it at all? Only a merchant looking to set up recurring billing may actually need to retain cardholder data themselves and we’ve often found that B2C ecommerce merchants typically don’t need to support recurring billing profiles.
<ul>
<li class="p1">Wherever and whenever cardholder data can be stored by an external qualified body instead of your own organization is ideal, because nothing will help reach immediate PCI compliance more quickly than not storing or transmitting cardholder data at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Web applications and the protection of them often does not get enough attention,&#8221; says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-bucolo-mba-pcip-32744a2">Chris Bucolo</a>, Director of Market Strategy for <a href="https://www.controlscan.com/">ControlScan</a>. &#8220;If you have developed a web application in conjunction with ecommerce payment activities it is very important that a review of the code be done to determine what vulnerabilities may exist, which could lead to common attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.&#8221;</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Finally, Report</strong> –– Compile and submit required remediation validation records (if applicable), and submit compliance reports to the acquiring bank and card brands (i.e. Visa, MasterCard, American Express, etc.) with which you do business.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">Completing the Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)</h3>
<p class="p1">The SAQ is a relatively short document (i.e. five or six pages long) and can itself be completed in a number of hours by someone qualified within your organization. The work getting to that point, though, comes into play when attempting to answer the SAQ questions truthfully and thoroughly, and in a manner that will actually result in achieving compliance.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style='width:auto;'>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-raised-no-inside-shadow-no-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 2px solid #4E75F8 ; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            There are multiple SAQ types depending on your business. The SAQ A is a relatively short document, but SAQ D is 80 pages. You can get more information here about which one you will need.
                            </div>
                        </div></p>
<p class="p1">In so doing, an organization will doubtlessly encounter some significant technical challenges. Below is a quick outline of what you can expect based on my own experience is seeking compliance for clients.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Technical Challenges to Satisfying the PCI SAQ</h3>
<p class="p1">Even if credit card data passes through your self-hosted (i.e. non-SaaS) ecommerce platform, you are still on the hook for ensuring that any related servers you control (be it your database server, PoS system, credit card processing terminal, utility server or internet application server) are sufficiently secure and compliant.</p>
<p class="p1">Each server – or all IP addressable devices – that cardholder data is stored inside or transmitted through is termed a CDE (cardholder data environment) and requires:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Intrusion detection and prevention software – likeTripwire – with a notification escalation profile to alert administrators that someone may have gained unauthorized access to the server and/or tampered with the files/permissions on the server. Tripwire is software that detects the presence of a code change or file structure profile change on a server. A notification escalation profile is a series of automated email or SMS messages. dispatched to key systems personnel in the event that intrusion is detected or an unexpected change to the file structure profile has occurred.</li>
<li class="p1">Anti-virus software installed and running daily.</li>
<li class="p1">Its operating system to be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.</li>
<li class="p1">The containing room or server rack (i.e. the physical environment containing the computer systems running commerce related servers) be kept under lock-and-key with limited authorized administrative access only.</li>
<li class="p1">Entrance to/from the room by administrative personnel (including date/time and purpose of access) needs to be logged. These logs need to be archived and migrated off of the primary servers and housed securely elsewhere so that auditors can readily access them if required by the bank or credit card company.</li>
<li class="p1">All cardholder data that is retained for local storage be done so using what the PCI DSS refers to as strong encryption (see the <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/glossary.php">PCI SSC Glossary of Terms</a> for more info). Encryption protects the data from easily being read and utilized by attackers if stolen during a breach event.</li>
<li class="p1">The underlying strong encryption architecture must be fully documented and kept up to date.</li>
<li class="p1">Personnel with remote access (or non-console administrative access) to the server environment must connect via multi-factor authentication only.</li>
<li class="p1">External penetration testing be performed every six months to ensure the environment is secure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">Ongoing Maintenance: Mitigating Common Data Security Exploits</h3>
<p class="p1">Physical servers need to be continually patched against newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Consider various security exploits that have arisen recently such as<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed"> HEARTBLEED</a>,<a href="https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf"> POODLE</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logjam_(computer_security)">Logjam</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class='dropshadowboxes-container ' style='width:auto;'>
                            <div class='dropshadowboxes-drop-shadow dropshadowboxes-rounded-corners dropshadowboxes-raised-no-inside-shadow-no-outside-shadow dropshadowboxes-effect-default' style=' border: 2px solid #4E75F8 ; height:; background-color:#ffffff;    '>
                            Note: TLS (transport layer security) –– sometimes referred to as SSL –– is the underlying encryption protocol for secure data transmission over the Internet. It is the “S” in HTTPS. 
                            </div>
                        </div></p>
<p class="p1">Your web application or ecommerce platform that is processing credit or debit cards also needs to be secured against client side (i.e. web browser) code exploits such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSS">XSS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL Injection Attacks</a>, to name a few.</p>
<h2 class="p3">PCI Audit Breakdown: Time and Costs are Typically Involved in Reaching Compliance</h2>
<p class="p10"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16933" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero-2.jpg" alt="pci-compliance-section-hero-2" width="750" height="400" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero-2.jpg 1562w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero-2-300x160.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-section-hero-2-750x400.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">On average, our experienced systems administration team will spend three to four business days securing a single server and preparing the appropriate documentation for a Level 3 or Level 4 merchant. The costs for doing so when factoring our time and the merchant’s staffing resources averages out to about $14,650 USD.</p>
<p class="p1">Merchants attempting to reach PCI compliance themselves however, without support from an outside partner, and who are already themselves adept at dealing with data security subject matter, can expect to spend upward of 3-4 weeks of time performing the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Researching the PCI Data Security Standards (DSS)</li>
<li class="p1">Determining which level of compliance and which PCI SAQ is required</li>
<li class="p1">Securing their physical servers (often the largest and most costly aspect of the project)</li>
<li class="p1">Examining any third party plugins or software components on the servers that cardholder data passes through and ensuring they, too, are PCI compliant and can produce external documentation that proves such</li>
<li class="p1">Completing the PCI SAQ and Attestation of Compliance (ROC)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For complex undertakings involving more than one onsite data center and where a merchant is both capturing and retaining cardholder data, budget at least six weeks in your project plan and estimate related costs to be between $48,625 – $64,900 USD to reach compliance.</p>
<p class="p1">The above estimate factors some time for multiple staff within your organization that usually involves a multidisciplinary group of business analysts, system administrators, ecommerce platform developers, project managers, legal teams and resource protection staff. It also takes into account some budget for outside consultant/auditor fees, and provision to hire a third party Qualified Security Assessor.</p>
<p class="p1">Note however that our estimate does not factor in any additional costs related to purchasing new server racks, upgrading computer systems, adding new software licenses and installing access control systems (such as staff ID card systems) or any other physical expenses that may be required to achieve compliance.</p>
<h3 class="p11">How Your Ecommerce Software Affects Your PCI</h3>
<p class="p1">You can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/">acquire ecommerce software</a> in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Buying commercial software to run on your on-premise hardware</li>
<li class="p1">Using open source software on your on-premise hardware (the Do-It-Yourself approach)</li>
<li class="p1">Signing up for <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/saas-ecommerce-on-premise/">hosted software delivered as a service (SaaS)</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Each approach strikes a different balance between your costs, benefits and PCI security risks and workload. The table sums up the highlights, and the following sections discuss each option in more detail.</p>
<p class="p10"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16932" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-chart.jpg" alt="pci audit" width="750" height="938" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-chart.jpg 1600w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-chart-300x375.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pci-compliance-chart-750x938.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3 class="p12">#1: Commercial Software: The Costly Option</h3>
<p class="p1">This requires you to buy and maintain your own hardware, plus shell out for a commercial software license and annual support.</p>
<p class="p1">The software might be PCI-compliant out of the box, or you could have lots of work getting there. But any extra support you require from the vendor for PCI will likely cost extra.</p>
<p class="p1">This option could work for you, if your company chooses to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Buy and maintain on-premise hardware</li>
<li class="p1">Pay for an on-premise software license and support</li>
<li class="p1">Maintain in-house expertise to install, customize and maintain an ecommerce platform</li>
<li class="p1">Keep someone on call 24/7 to troubleshoot any problem and get the platform back up fast if it ever goes down</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Clearly, the drawbacks here are the high costs of hardware, software, and support –– plus the unknown burden of handling some of your own PCI compliance. If that doesn’t sound appealing, skip this approach and read on.</p>
<h3 class="p12">#2: On-Premise, Open Source Software: Lower Cost, Higher Risk</h3>
<p class="p1">This option is a lot like writing your own code. You still pay for your hardware, but you avoid paying any software license fee. Sounds like a bargain, right? Not so fast.</p>
<p class="p1">You have to assemble, compile, install and tweak your own software. And, as for PCI, this can turn into a money-pit. Open source is a black box where no one really knows what’s going on.</p>
<p class="p1">“The problem with open source is that you’re not buying from any vendor,” says Beckett. “So there’s no one to fall back on for help. You might not get any support, or no phone number you can call. Or maybe the PCI auditor might not like something about the platform.”</p>
<p class="p1">In that case, you’re stuck. You may have to document every step of your process in painful detail. That means holding meetings, analyzing code, sketching flowcharts, writing reports&#8230; spending weeks of effort that can easily outweigh any savings you gained from open source.</p>
<p class="p1">The DIY option could work, if your company can afford to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Buy and maintain on-premise hardware</li>
<li class="p1">Maintain in-house expertise to link, tweak and maintain ecommerce software</li>
<li class="p1">Take staff time to hold many meetings and create PCI-related documents</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Using open source software means you are responsible for 100% of your PCI compliance ––  not to mention your store’s uptime. If you don’t want to take on those burdens, skip this approach and read on.</p>
<h3 class="p12">#3: Hosted Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): Low Cost, Low Risk</h3>
<p class="p1">Software running as a service is accessed through the web, running on hardware maintained in a secure data center by your service provider. If you want to save money, and can’t spare a lot of staff to develop PCI policies and write reports, consider using a hosted ecommerce service such as BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p1">This way, you can forget about fiddling with ecommerce hardware and software, pay one monthly fee to cover your ecommerce platform, and remain PCI-compliant with a minimum of time and expense.</p>
<p class="p1">An important consideration when electing this option, however, is that you will still be required to complete an SAQ (self-assessment questionnaire) as a Level 2-4 merchant and an ROC (i.e. report on compliance, also synonymous with Attestation of Compliance) if you are a Level 1 merchant.</p>
<p class="p1">Therefore, the work in documenting and reporting on a quality SaaS ecommerce platform regardless of your compliance level is much less involved in terms of cost and risk than the other two options presented.</p>
<p class="p1">The SaaS option will work for you if your company:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Wants to save money on hardware, software licenses and support</li>
<li class="p1">Doesn’t have people to fiddle with hardware and software</li>
<li class="p1">Prefers to pay one monthly fee to cover your ecommerce platform</li>
<li class="p1">Wants to remain PCI-compliant with a minimum of effort</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">With lower costs, less risk, and fewer PCI hassles, this option is the chosen path for many online stores.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a full chart of what is covered and what isn’t with PCI Compliance and your chosen ecommerce platform:</p>
<p class="p10"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16927" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bcpci-k-06.png" alt="bcpci-k-06" width="750" height="1289" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bcpci-k-06.png 768w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bcpci-k-06-300x516.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bcpci-k-06-750x1289.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2 class="p6">We’ve Successfully Achieved PCI Compliance: What’s Next?</h2>
<p class="p1">As if achieving PCI security compliance wasn’t complex enough on its own, maintaining compliance year-over-year and keeping up with ever-evolving nuances to PCS data security standards (DSS) has proven itself a perpetual expense and burden to any organization.</p>
<p class="p1">The latest PCI DSS standard (version 3.2) released in April of 2016, for example, defines a number of changes to previously accepted rules and regulations on a variety of PCI subjects, touching upon both documentation requirements and technical adjustments to the physical hosting environment (CDE) itself. This means as a self-hosted merchant you’ll need to concern yourself not only with getting all these requirements perfected the first time around, but you’ll also be expected to manage lists of future change requests and down-the-road migration plans that will keep your technical teams very busy ad infinitum (i.e. forever). Let’s face it, they often have more than enough to do as it is.</p>
<p class="p1">In short, maintaining compliance is an ongoing process, involving all of the above as well as quarterly vulnerability scans and completing a new SAQ and Attestation of Compliance each year. The payment card industry doesn&#8217;t mess around when it comes to PCI.</p>
<p class="p1">If your organization is presently at PCI compliance Level 3 and your credit card transaction volume is trending upwards at a rate of 20% or more annually, consider hiring a QSA and having a formal external security audit done every year, even if your bank doesn’t require it.</p>
<p class="p1">In this manner, your team won’t be flanked by a last minute crunch to get it done which will result in overstatements, omissions and increased third party auditing costs. You’ll also proactively position your organization for an easy transition upward to a higher compliance level at a later time.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, remember, PCI compliance is common-sense security best practices. Security expert <a href="https://www.jeremiahgrossman.com/">Jeremiah Grossman</a> explains that it’s hard for any standard that uses prescriptive guidance to keep up with attackers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span class="s1">&#8220;Regardless of what the standard says, or requires, this is what I tell everyone on how best to protect themselves — or at least their websites.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span class="s1">1) <strong>Assign an individual or group that is accountable for website security.</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span class="s1">2) <strong>Find your IT assets – all of them – and prioritize their business value.</strong> You can’t secure what you don’t know you own.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span class="s1">3) <strong>Measure your current security posture from an attacker’s perspective.</strong> Remember, the bad guys aren’t concerned with what standards say, what laws say or anything. They’ll take the path of least resistance in and don’t play by the rules.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span class="s1">4) <strong>Trend and track the lifecycle of vulnerabilities</strong>, such as the average number of vulnerabilities (by time, business unit, or vulnerability class), the average time to fix and remediation rates. Everyone has vulnerabilities, but what separates the hacked from the not hacked is often the speed and comprehensiveness of their patch processes.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span class="s1">5) <strong>Fast detection and response.</strong> When being attacked by professionals, everyone gets compromised eventually. What separates significant damage versus an annoyance incident is how fast the attackers are detected and kicked off the system. It’s difficult for attackers to cause a lot of harm if they’re only on a compromised system for no more than a day or a few hours.&#8221;</span></em></p>
