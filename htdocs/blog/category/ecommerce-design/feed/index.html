Hmm… let’s ask the <a href="https://adwords.googleblog.com/2016/05/ways-to-be-useful-for-mobile-shoppers.html">VP of Google Shopping</a>:</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Whether they’re looking for a new sofa or the perfect pair of earrings, people who search and shop on their smartphones at least once a week say that product images are the shopping feature they turn to most.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Jonathan Alferness, Vice President, Product Management, Google Shopping Inside AdWords, May 2016</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">When you’re shopping online, product images are the closest you can get to an in-store experience; zooming in and looking at alternate angles is the digital replacement for holding it in your hands or trying it on.</p>
<p class="p1">Photos are how shoppers judge fit, quality, and overall desirability of your product — and your brand. The care you put into your imagery reflects the care you put into your business and your credibility as a seller.</p>
<p class="p1">At <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/">Pixelz</a>, we’ve edited more than 15 million images for more than 10,000 retailers, brands, and photo studios around the world. In working with everyone from multi-brand fashion groups, startup marketplaces, mobile apps, and name brands like <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/case-studies-express/">Express</a> and <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/case-studies-arcteryx/">Arc’teryx</a>, to DIY entrepreneurs launching businesses from home, we’ve learned that the biggest barrier to high quality product images isn’t budget — it’s knowledge.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">The biggest barrier to high quality product images isn’t budget — it’s knowledge.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Many budding entrepreneurs are intimidated by the technical aspects of product photography and wary of the hefty price tags they seen thrown around: $5k/day for a model, $10k camera lenses, $1500 studio rentals, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">Don’t be.</p>
<p class="p1">In a world where the average person is already walking around with a 12-Megapixel camera in their pocket, and where the most powerful image editing software ever created is only $10 a month, product photography doesn’t have to break your bank.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re writing this guide with BigCommerce to demystify product photography and post-production for everyone. High quality images are within your reach, with just a little bit of reading and planning.</p>
<p class="p1">In this guide we’ll cover topics like:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">How to build your own ecommerce photo studio</li>
<li class="p1">How to use your smartphone for product photography</li>
<li class="p1">What kind of lights to use (when and why)</li>
<li class="p1">How to add shadows to product images for a more professional look</li>
<li class="p1">How to photograph reflective products</li>
<li class="p1">How to create ghost mannequin images</li>
<li class="p1">Alternatives to white backgrounds (and when to use them)</li>
<li class="p1">The importance of retouching –– and some best practices you need to know (or else Twitter may take your brand down!)</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">By the end, you’ll be ready to confidently go forth and give your products the image quality they (and you) deserve.</p>

Nor are we going to bother with a discussion of fundamental image edits because we’ve already covered that in the others chapters in this guide and we’ll assume you are following general best practices.</p>
<p class="p1">If not, you can get caught up in the subsequent chapters where we cover:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">How to build your own product photo studio (including the equipment you will need)</li>
<li class="p1">How to use your smartphone for product photos, if that’s all you have</li>
<li class="p1">How to shape light</li>
<li class="p1">How to add shadows</li>
<li class="p1">How to photograph highly reflective products</li>
<li class="p1">How to remove white backgrounds</li>
<li class="p1">How to master ghost mannequin photography</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">If you come across a term you don’t recognize, refer to our <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/glossary-retouching-product-images/">retouching glossary</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, this chapter focuses on more advanced techniques, broadly categorized as retouching. We’ll walk you through popular retouching choices for three common ways to shoot apparel:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">flat</li>
<li class="p1">on a mannequin or hanger</li>
<li class="p1">on model</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Let’s focus specifically on garment retouching (divided into light, medium, and heavy levels), before finishing with a discussion of <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/skin-retouching-dos-and-donts/">model skin retouching</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Note: This isn’t a how-to; it’s an exploration of what retouching is and what it can do for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">We’ll discuss best practices, but just as in photography, many retouching decisions are driven by your brand’s aesthetic.</p>
<p class="p1">Outdoor apparel may call for a raw natural look, while luxury brands favor a more glamorous appearance.</p>
<p class="p1">We won’t try to make those decisions for you; we’ll simply present you with options and explain why each route might be favored.</p>
<p class="p1">At <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/">Pixelz</a> we’ve edited over 15 million images for leading brands, retailers, and commercial photo studios. The principles we’re discussing here are based on our experience, but should not be taken to represent any of our clients. All opinions expressed are our own.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Garment Retouching</h2>
<p class="p1">The principles of garment retouching are largely the same regardless of whether you’re shooting flat, on a hanger or mannequin, or on-model. Your biggest concerns are cleanup and shape.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21011" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/garment-retouching.png" alt="" width="617" height="412" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/garment-retouching.png 617w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/garment-retouching-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>No matter how much time a stylist takes on prep, samples aren’t going to be perfect.</em></p>
<p class="p1">When you’re shooting samples, well, your photos aren’t going to be perfect right out of the camera.</p>
<p class="p1">Your stylist may be able to fix some problems through <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/prepare-your-products-for-a-photoshoot-like-a-pro/">product photoshoot preparation</a>, pinning, and clever arrangements, but what do you do when the fabric is too sheer, the color is off, or one leg is longer than the other?</p>
<p class="p1">Retouching can solve problems that can’t be handled in the studio (as well as simplifying many that can).</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s take a look at some common retouching processes, broken down by level. We’ll also talk about two techniques that fall outside of basic level categorization:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">symmetry</li>
<li class="p1">ghost mannequins</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="p6">Light Retouching: The Fix It Up Process</h3>
<p class="p1">Light retouching focuses on cleanup, which means removal and replacement of obviously unwanted details. In this scenario, there are few aesthetic decisions to be made and you’re essentially performing repairs.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21008" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-before.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="398" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-before.jpg 2685w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-before-300x373.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-before-750x933.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-21007" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-after.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="398" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-after.jpg 2685w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-after-300x373.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-styling-retouch-after-750x933.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Before and after of jean legs retouched to erase creases caused by styling to strike mannequin ankle.</em></p>
<p class="p1">You should almost always remove evidence of styling, wear, and construction problems. That means removing dust, pins, untidy stitching, and loose threads. It also means removing heavy creases like <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/glossary-retouching-product-images/#B19">packaging creases</a>, or <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/glossary-retouching-product-images/#B20">creases from styling</a> (like if a trouser leg has been shortened by a stylist with a mid-leg fold).</p>
<p class="p1">Light retouching also involves recreating areas after removing small props, like hangers, wire hands, or mannequin cutaway necks.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>When to use light retouching</h3></p>
<p class="p1">If you have a modest budget, you should be performing this level of retouching. Showing someone a worn down sample with pins sticking out of the shoulders isn’t accurately representing your product.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p6">Medium Retouching: The Low Hanging Fruit Process</h3>
<p class="p1">Medium level retouching also focuses on cleanup, but starts to move into shape smoothing as well.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re doing everything you did at the light level, while also making more subjective/aesthetic decisions to proactively improve your image.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21006" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-before.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="482" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-before.jpg 3633w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-before-300x452.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-before-750x1130.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-21005" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-after.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="480" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-after.jpg 3648w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-after-300x450.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/remove-creases-from-misfit-retouch-after-750x1125.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Before and after of retouching to remove crease caused by misfit; note armpit and shoulder area.</em></p>
<p class="p1">For example, you’re still removing packaging creases, but now you’re also removing creases and folds caused by misfit or styling challenges. Like, if a product fits a mannequin too tightly and creases are uneven on opposing sides of the body, you can reduce creases through retouching.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re also focusing on outer shape.</p>
<p class="p1">Shape is one of the most important parts of apparel product images, because it’s a demonstration of fit. Using retouching to smooth the edges of a garment, eliminating small bumps from an imperfect fit, is an excellent way to improve the presentation of your product.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>When to use medium retouching</h3></p>
<p class="p1">We recommend this level of retouching in most instances. You get all the cleanup of light retouching along with improvements that are relevant to almost all product images. If you have special challenges that aren’t addressed at this level, you can up the ante to heavy retouching.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p6">Heavy Retouching: The Image Detailing Process</h3>
<p class="p1">Heavy retouching focuses in on details like shadowing, imprints, and consistency.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, you’re doing everything you did at the medium level while adding additional retouching.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20999" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-before.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="480" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-before.jpg 1393w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-before-300x450.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-before-750x1125.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-20998" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-after.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="480" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-after.jpg 1393w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-after-300x450.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/match-shape-silhouette-retouch-shirt-after-750x1125.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Using silhouettes for retouching can create extremely consistent shape.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Note that a heavily retouched image still isn’t one you look at and say, “Wow, that looks plastic!” That’s not heavy retouching, that’s bad retouching.</p>
<p class="p1">At no point should anyone ever look at one of your product images and think it’s fake. That immediately kills your credibility with the viewer, and with no trust there’s no sale.</p>
<p class="p1">To explain heavy retouching, let’s think about it in terms of creases, always one of the biggest issues addressed by retouching.</p>
<p class="p1">At the heavy retouch level, you’re not just removing obvious creases; you’re also reducing hard shadows, contrast, and highlights caused by creases. It’s a more subtle approach that can improve images with difficult fabrics, like laminated jackets.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes undesirable imprints can appear and create confusion about what’s part of a garment and what’s caused by outside factors. For example, sheer fabric can show visible outlines of mannequins, undergarments, nipples, and pockets. Retouching can eliminate those distractions.</p>
<p class="p1">Retouching can also ensure consistent shape is given to edge lines like sleeve cuffs, trouser cuffs, waistbands, and hemlines.</p>
<p class="p1">By consistent shape, I mean something like always curving in, curving out, or staying straight.</p>
<p class="p1">Consistency is pleasing to the eye and shows an attention to detail that builds credibility with customers.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Symmetry</h3>
<p class="p1">Many human standards of beauty are based on symmetry; for example, numerous studies have proven that more symmetrical faces are considered more beautiful.</p>
<p class="p1">Why does that matter? Because it alludes to a psychological preference for symmetry by your customers (and likely, even, by you!).</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21010" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-before.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-before.jpg 3500w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-before-300x469.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-before-750x1173.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-21009" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-after.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-after.jpg 3499w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-after-300x469.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/symmetry-retouch-coat-product-image-after-750x1173.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Before and after of retouching to ensure a symmetrical shape in product images.</em></p>
<p class="p1">When symmetrical apparel, like most jackets, dresses, tops, and pants, is photographed asymmetrically it looks sloppy.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes it creates a pronounced lean, or makes the quality of construction look poor. This is especially evident in product images shot on mannequin or on hangers, where there’s no implied human movement to make irregularities seem natural.</p>
<p class="p1">Symmetry can be applied in retouching by setting guidelines and applying them across your product category.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, for outerwear like a jacket we will:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Set a vertical axis</li>
<li class="p1">Match the height of major points like shoulders, armpits, sleeves, hems</li>
<li class="p1">Match the width of sleeves</li>
<li class="p1">Match the gap between sleeves and torso</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Ensuring symmetry through retouching is one of the most beneficial things you can do to create a consistent, attractive presentation, and we recommend it regardless of the level of retouching.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Invisible / Ghost Mannequin</h3>
<p class="p1">We’ve covered the invisible mannequin effect, aka the ghost mannequin, previously, but it is worth mentioning again.</p>
<p class="p1">In brief, the invisible mannequin is a post-production technique that combines two or more photos to create a single mannequin-free image. It has the advantage of demonstrating on-figure shape and showing more of the product than otherwise possible while minimizing distractions.</p>
<p class="p1">The invisible mannequin is a good option for retailers who need on-figure imagery but don’t want mannequins in their images or to use a increase budget on models.</p>
<p class="p1">Speaking of models&#8230;</p>
<h2 class="p3">Model Skin Retouching &amp; Cropping</h2>
<p class="p1">I’ve found that if you start a conversation about retouching (“You know, Photoshop”) with someone outside of the photography industry, 9 times out of 10 they jump straight to body image, advertising, and the harmful effects of unrealistic expectations for women.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re not discussing body shape here.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a valid discussion, and <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/photoshop-models-laws/">one we’ve covered in depth in elsewhere</a>, but this article is about skin retouching.</p>
<p class="p1">We’re not touching body fat or bone structure.</p>
<p class="p1">Before we dive into different aesthetics surrounding moles, skin tone, and eye bags, let’s briefly talk about a sometimes overlooked aspect of handling model images: cropping.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Cropping: Face or Faceless?</h3>
<p class="p1">If you have model product images that are tops or full body, you may want to consider eliminating some headaches by the simple expedient of cropping them out.</p>
<p class="p1">A traditional crop for model images is at the top of the head. After all, a beautiful face helps sell product.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21012" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/face-or-faceless.png" alt="" width="550" height="417" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/face-or-faceless.png 550w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/face-or-faceless-300x227.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Cropping part of a model’s face affects usage rights, casting, product focus, and retouching.</em></p>
<p class="p1">However, cropping consistently at a different axis, like below the eyes, below the nose, or below the mouth has its own advantages.</p>
<h3 class="p1">1.Usage rights</h3>
<p class="p1">Many models and agencies are open to granting rights to faceless images for longer terms than images featuring the face.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s pretty simple: an image where the model can’t be identified isn’t as valuable as an image where they can.</p>
<p class="p1">Please note that image usage rights can be complex. If it’s not directly addressed in your model release, don’t just assume you can crop out the model’s face and use it forever.</p>
<h3 class="p1">2. Model casting</h3>
<p class="p1">You can cast a wider net when casting models if you’re focused on fit and don’t have to be as concerned about face. That can mean finding a better body fit and lower rates.</p>
<h3 class="p1">3. Product focus</h3>
<p class="p1">Eyes draw the eye. If a model’s face is on the page, people will inevitably be drawn to that face. If they’re looking at the face, they’re not looking at your product. Crop below the eyes and you will retain a greater product focus.</p>
<h3 class="p1">4. Retouching simplification</h3>
<p class="p1">Because the face is uncovered and naturally attracts close scrutiny, a disproportionate amount of retouching time is spent on it compared to other parts of the model. If you crop out most of the face, you don’t have to deal with flyaway hairs, eye bags, or as much acne, freckles, and general skin blemishes.</p>
<p class="p1">Regardless of where you choose to crop your model product images, you should be consistent. You will also have to decide what style of retouching you want to use for the rest of the model’s skin.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Skin Retouching: Know Thyself</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21002" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-recline.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-recline.jpg 1200w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-recline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-recline-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Skin retouching is about understanding your brand’s aesthetic and staying true to it. It’s less about “how much” you want to retouch, and more about making sure the retouching you perform reinforces your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">For comparison, let’s look at two different styles of skin retouching:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Natural</li>
<li class="p1">Classic</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">They require a similar level of effort and hence will cost you about the same should you hire a professional retoucher or service.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Natural Skin Retouching &#8211; Here Today or Here Forever?</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21004" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-before.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="844" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-before.jpg 2211w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-before-300x396.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-before-750x989.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Natural retouching leaves most moles and freckles because they’re a permanent feature of a model’s skin.</em></p>
<p class="p1">If you’re an outdoor apparel brand that prides itself on looking great while getting down and dirty, you don’t want your model’s face to look like it’s in a cosmetics’ ad.</p>
<p class="p1">The guiding principle for natural retouching is that less is more.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re retouching to remove distractions, but if you go too far, you will actually create a distraction by becoming obviously inauthentic. Natural retouching should be subtle.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Do’s and Dont’s</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Check out these <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/blog/skin-retouching-dos-and-donts/">do’s and don’ts of skin retouching</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">The two major parts of skin retouching address:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Skin tone and texture</li>
<li class="p1">Marks and blemishes</li>
</ol>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21001" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-before.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="884" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-before.jpg 1645w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-before-300x828.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-before-750x2071.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-21000" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-after.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="884" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-after.jpg 1645w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-after-300x828.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-even-skin-tone-retouching-after-750x2071.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Note model’s thighs. Tone of the face has been taken and the rest of skin retouched to match.</em></p>
<p class="p1">An effective approach to skin tone is to simply even it out over the entire body. Nobody tans evenly, and when a model is standing all day under bright lights, circulation will become poor and extremities redden (particularly hands).</p>
<p class="p1">Picking a neutral area, like the face, and then adjusting tone elsewhere to match that reference will create a more attractive photo.</p>
<p class="p1">When I say “blemishes,” I mean acne, moles, bruises, scratches, birthmarks, freckles, and other marks on the skin. Natural retouching focuses on reduction rather than removal, usually following a temporary vs permanent rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Is it here today, or here forever?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Answering that question tells you what to do with a blemish, if you’re following natural retouching principles.</p>
<p class="p1">Acne and bruises are temporary. If you’re removing them, you’re not fundamentally changing your model’s skin. They usually don’t have those marks.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, a scar or birthmark is a permanent part of the model. Leaving blemishes like that, unless they’re so prominent as to be distracting, stays true to your model’s character.</p>
<p class="p1">Run that rule over your model’s skin and what seemed vague and subjective becomes a much simpler standard.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Goosebumps? Temporary, gone.</li>
<li class="p1">Freckles? Permanent, keep them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">Classic Skin Retouching &#8211; Remove Blemishes, Soften and Smooth Skin</h3>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21003" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-after.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="844" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-after.jpg 2211w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-after-300x396.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/model-remove-all-moles-retouching-after-750x989.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Classic retouching removes most moles, freckles, and other blemishes.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Have you ever watched a movie on a brand new HDTV and had that “too real” feeling? Where the picture is so sharp and smooth that it actually looks worse, like the latest Hollywood special effects blockbuster is a soap opera?</p>
<p class="p1">Classic retouching can help you avoid a similar feeling in your product photography.</p>
<p class="p1">Incredibly high definition cameras and powerful lights can create a photo that counters an audience’s expectation of what a product image should be.</p>
<p class="p1">Classic retouching doesn’t usually bother with evening out skin tone unless there are notable differences. Rather, all skin is softened and smoothed to create the aspirationally perfect skin expected of a cover model.</p>
<p class="p1">Most blemishes are removed in classic retouching, like freckles and prominent moles, but not all of them. It’s good to leave less noticeable moles or the occasional freckle to keep a feeling of familiarity.</p>
<p class="p1">Again, you never want to go so far that an image feels fake.</p>
<h2 class="p3">How To Get Your Images Retouched</h2>
<p class="p1">Now that you understand what retouching can do, the next question is how to get your images retouched cost-effectively.</p>
<p class="p1">There are basically two options:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">in-house</li>
<li class="p1">outsourced</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">In-house means doing it yourself, hiring full-time retouchers, or hiring freelancers. All three options are time consuming, expensive, and don’t scale well (seasonal shoots cause frequent bottlenecks). They do, however, usually give you tight control and good communication.</p>
<p class="p1">Traditional outsourcing offers lower prices and more scale, but at the risk of inconsistent quality and poor communication. If you end up with the wrong outsourcing solution, it will drain you of time and resources without actually improving your quality.</p>
<h3 class="p6">Outsourced Options</h3>
<p class="p1">Pixelz is a professional retouching solution that gives you the control and communication of in-house editing through a fully developed web platform and professional support.</p>
<p class="p1">A plan like Pixelz PRO Retailer offers product-specific retouching options, next-morning turnaround times, and prices starting at less than a dollar per image. You can try Pixelz out with <a href="https://www.pixelz.com/">10 free retouched images of your choice</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">In March, we brought the competition back –– with more categories, expert judges and $17,000 in prizes.</p>
<p class="p1">This year, we were blown away with the response. More than 2X the number of brands submitted  –– making the competition even fiercer.</p>
<p class="p1">After reviewing more than 1,000 entries, today we’re excited to announce our 2017 Design Awards finalists. These brands will be presented to our expert panel of judges in the coming weeks, with winners being announced in June.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">2X the number of brands submitted this year over 2016 – making the competition even fiercer, and your vote even more important.</p>

<p class="p1">But, from today through May 21st we also need your help to determine the recipient of this year’s People’s Choice award.</p>

<p class="p1">That’s why today, we’re opening voting up to you –– the online shoppers these brands are trying to win over.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, the winner of the People’s Choice vote will be awarded a $3,000 cash prize and a mention in an Inc. Magazine advertisement in the September issue (the magazine’s most-read issue of the year), so we encourage you to review all the sites carefully before voting for your favorite.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Kevin-design-awards-2017.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20403" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Kevin-design-awards-2017.png" alt="Kevin-design-awards-2017" width="640" height="313" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Kevin-design-awards-2017.png 1290w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Kevin-design-awards-2017-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Kevin-design-awards-2017-750x366.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlee">Kevin Lee</a> is one of the most seasoned corporate innovation leaders around. With nearly two decades of experience leading digital design teams within some of the world’s most prolific brands, Kevin has seen firsthand the prioritization of corporate innovation proliferate over the years.</p>
<p class="p1">He is a 10+ year veteran creative executive and design director with extensive experience in UX, product design and brand strategy. His global experience includes working with top 500 brands in mobile, consumer products, commerce, finance and the healthcare industry, including VISA, Samsung, PayPal, eBay and WhirlPool.</p>
<p class="p1">He works to develop integrated digital and product solutions that support business strategies for a high-performing multidisciplinary teams and the millions of global consumers who use their products.</p>
<p class="p1">Kevin’s best pieces of advice for businesses looking to drive innovation through design are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Prove Impact over Accuracy:</strong> Innovators often think too much about perfection, and carry this mindset into the discovery and approval processes. We tend to rely heavily on showcasing previous successes, mistakenly thinking that past triumphs will move the needle for our current requests. As a group, we must do a better job illustrating the big picture impact to the decision makers, many of whom have reached the pinnacles of their careers because they are also big picture impact thinkers.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Be a Storyteller:</strong> As innovators, we often focus on building stuff; developing shiny objects that we hope people will react positively to. But decision makers and end users don’t look at one interaction as an experience. We must think holistically and find ways to bring your vision to life through words and emotions. That’s the only way that stakeholders and consumers will be able to truly see where, how, when and why your digital product can work for them.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">Online consumers are the most qualified experts to judge a site’s design and usability. It is web users who push companies like Google, Apple, BigCommerce and more to increase site speed, design ever more creatively and to make the online experience as simple and convenient as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">Social voting will open in May. One brand will win an award based solely on the votes of the online community. More information will be announced when the time comes to cast your vote.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>As told to BigCommerce by Sassa Akervall, CEO of SISU Guard.</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">“We were deeply honored to have been selected as the Sports Category winner of the BigCommerce Design Awards. As a CEO of a company that offers a great product, I already knew that with SISU we had something special. But I am sincerely grateful for the recognition from BigCommerce, and the opportunity to be featured as their showcase website in Inc. Magazine.</p>
<p class="p1">Considering the amount of websites that are hosted on BigCommerce, I should admit I was pleasantly surprised to learn that SISU was chosen as one of the most excellent on this platform. I am very pleased to receive this award pleased because it is an award recognizing our exceptional marketing team, our phenomenal partners and above all, the customers who are the strongest brand advocates of SISU Mouthguards. And, I have to express my gratitude to all the SISU fans who were excited about our nomination and worked so hard to help us win.”</p>

<p class="p1">We’ve seen a 272% increase in conversion and 193% increase in mobile revenue across all 10 of the brands we have on BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>As told to BigCommerce by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corybarnes">Cory Barnes</a>, Marketing Manager at Exxel Outdoors, the parent company of Sierra Designs.</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">“We decided it was a great time for a redesign in 2016 because we were <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration/">replatforming our ecommerce website</a> and transitioning over to BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p1">We had some navigation issues on desktop and a separate mobile site that didn’t make for a seamless user experience. We were inspired by some of the other leading outdoor brand’s sites and their clean aesthetic, lifestyle driven photography, as well as the responsive designs we were seeing from those competitors.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the first redesign that the current team was a part of, but we can happily say that metrics are up year over year.</p>
<p class="p1">There are certainly a lot of factors involved, but the updated user experience has had positive effect on conversion. We’re also excited about the flexibility that working with BigCommerce has provided. With lower development costs, we’re able to experiment and work with new vendors that can potentially bring more value to the consumer.</p>
<p class="p1">Since the award, we’ve seen a 272% increase on conversion and 193% increase in mobile revenue across all 10 of the brands we have on BigCommerce.”</p>

<p class="p1">Switching to a BigCommerce theme, my conversion rate immediately went up. Mobile time on site went up. Everything went up!</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Tyler Sullivan, Founder and CEO at BombTech Golf</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">In 2016, BigCommerce stacked hands on a bold mission: to empower retailers, developers and partners to build world class sites in a fraction of the time as other ecommerce platforms.</p>
<p class="p1">We wanted retailers to have a pool of modern, beautiful, fully responsive themes that would empower their brand, drive more sales and engage with shoppers &#8212; both today and tomorrow &#8212; in ways they previously couldn’t.</p>
<p class="p1">Our strong community of merchants, developers and partners stepped up and helped us build that theme platform.</p>
<p class="p1">In early 2016, we released an early access edition of this <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/new-themes/">new theme platform</a>. Then, throughout the year, we spent countless hours speaking with many of you to incorporate your feedback to build themes that were faster, stronger and more beautiful.</p>
<p class="p1">We poured through net promoter score studies, support inquiries and surveys to drastically improve the quality of our new themes and framework.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, through that feedback, we are proud to announce the full release of the new BigCommerce theme development platform and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">theme marketplace</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">We hope this new platform feels as much yours as it does ours.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s have a look at what’s new.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Theme Editor and Edit Theme Files</h2>
<p class="p1">We’ve eliminated the disadvantages of our old Style Editor.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ve removed the need to edit HTML/CSS for things like inserting credit card logos, social media icons, adjusting the size of your images, adjusting the number of featured/popular/new products, and more. You can now do all of this within your new Theme Editor, without needing to touch the code.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stencil-editor.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-19288" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stencil-editor.png" alt="stencil-editor" width="750" height="387" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stencil-editor.png 1439w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stencil-editor-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stencil-editor-750x387.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Click on the photo to see the full image.</em></p>
<p class="p1">For those not afraid to get their hands a little dirty in HTML and CSS, don’t worry! With our edit theme files capability, you can easily access the HTML and CSS code to fully customize your site and build upon already existing templates.</p>
<p class="p1">Regardless of how you choose to edit and customize your theme, you’ll be able to preview your new site on desktop, mobile, or tablet –– all from one screen.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Fully Responsive Themes for a Mobile World</h2>
<p class="p1">Merchants can no longer afford to have a non-responsive site. Here are just a few case studies.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Exxel Outdoors Sees 193% Increase in Mobile Revenue &amp; 272% Increase in Mobile Conversion Rate</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19499" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-kelty.png" alt="new-themes-mobile-kelty" width="400" height="743" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-kelty.png 400w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-kelty-300x557.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://kelty.com/">Kelty </a>is one of several Exxel Outdoors brands.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">We want to make sure that someone on our site is having a great experience no matter what device they’re on.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Cory Barnes, Digital Marketing Manager for Exxel Outdoors</div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://exxel.com/">Exxel Outdoors</a> migrated 10 sites from an ASP.net framework to BigCommerce specifically for a mobile-responsive experience. It was clear their audience was mobile-driven, and traffic was high from mobile devices. Mobile conversions, though, remained incredibly low.</p>
<p class="p1">Once Exxel Outdoors launched all 10 sites, including Kelty and Sierra Designs, on the new BigCommerce theme framework, the team immediately began to see the revenue benefit.</p>
<p class="p1">“Mobile is very important to us,” said Cory Barnes, Digital Marketing Manager for Exxel Outdoors. “If you look at the percentage of visitors that are using mobile devices or tablets, the number increases every year. We expect that trend to continue and we want to make sure that someone on our site is having a great experience no matter what device they’re on.”</p>
<h3 class="p3">BombTech Golf Goes from $400,000 in Revenue to $1.1M Thanks to Mobile-Friendly Update</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="wp-image-19498 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bombtech.png" alt="new-themes-mobile-bombtech" width="400" height="740" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bombtech.png 400w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bombtech-300x555.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p3">All of our mobile traffic from social media can now check out easily.</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Tyler Sullivan, Founder of BombTech Golf</div></div></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bombtechgolf.com/">BombTech Golf </a>drives hundreds of visitors from Facebook Live videos (which get hundreds of thousands of views), but a poor mobile experience stopped sales in their tracks.</p>
<p class="p1">With a replatform and site redesign, both focusing on mobile friendliness and UX, BombTech Golf broke the million dollar revenue mark in less than a year.</p>
<p class="p1">That was in 2015.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/bombtech-golf">In 2016, BombTech Golf pulled in $4 million in revenue</a>. In 2017, they are on track to hit nearly $9 million.</p>
<p class="p1">“I hit my stride after making $1.1 million that year,” says Tyler Sullivan, Founder of BombTech Golf. “I figured out the power of video and authenticity, beyond a mobile checkout that works. That was a game-changing moment because all of our mobile traffic from social media could now check out easily.”</p>
<h3 class="p3">BPI Sports Reports Significant Traffic Coming From Mobile, Increases Mobile Revenue 120%</h3>
<p class="p3"><img class="size-full wp-image-19497 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bpi-sports.png" alt="new-themes-mobile-bpi-sports" width="400" height="717" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bpi-sports.png 400w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-themes-mobile-bpi-sports-300x538.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p3">Sadly we can&#8217;t move things over to BigCommerce every month!</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Bill Maroulis, Digital Strategy Director at BPI Sports</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">BPI Sports predominantly sells through retail channels, like Walmart and GNC, as well as online channels like Amazon. They are one of the largest supplement companies around today, and are increasingly competing with a new breed of online direct-to-consumer supplement companies.</p>
<p class="p1">Online sales is a part of their business they aimed to grow in order to own a direct relationship with their customer.</p>
<p class="p1">Realizing the importance of mobile in doing this, they launched a mobile responsive site dedicated to ease of use and customer UX.</p>
<p class="p1">Since then, mobile revenue has shot up 120% and mobile conversions 49%. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/bpi-sports/">All in less than a month</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sadly we can&#8217;t move things over to BigCommerce every month,” says Bill Maroulis, Digital Strategy Director at <a href="https://bpisports.com/">BPI Sports</a>. “Even our organic traffic went up 60 to 90%!”</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>BigCommerce is the Digital Wallet Powerhouse</h3></p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce is the only ecommerce platform that comes out of the box with proven mobile conversion tools like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/paypal">PayPal One Touch</a>. For brands focused on mobile growth, these two digital wallets drive high conversion rates through single touch checkout.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Having my audience be on a mobile platform, I want to encourage that impulse buy,” says Brandon Chatham, CEO of <a href="https://www.natomounts.com/">NatoMounts</a>. “To do that, I needed to implement systems that would allow them to checkout in literal seconds. I use PayPal, Amazon, Stripe and ApplePay to do that with BigCommerce. In the first week after we launched, we had a new visitor land on the site and hit the finish order page in less than 43 seconds.”</p>

<p class="p2">Sales have grown over 75% in the last six months, just because of this change.</p>
<p class="p2"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Alex Young, General Manager at Kap7</div></div></p>
<p class="p2">“This is our second redesign and we have gotten nothing but positive feedback from our customers,” says Alex Young, <a href="http://www.kap7.com/">Kap7</a>’s General Manager. “The upgrade has not gone unnoticed –– from the look and feel of the website, to the ease of exploring, shopping and checking out.

As a result, sales have grown over 75% in the last six months, just because of this change.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Upgrading to a BigCommerce-designed theme was a huge win for us,” says Elizabeth Przygoda-Montgomery, Owner at <a href="http://www.shopboxhill.com/">BoxHill</a><span class="s1">. </span> “We now have complete control over the minor changes we wish to make on our store, and our customers have noticed, too!”</p>
<p class="p1">“Everyone remarks on the beautiful design and comments on what a clean store we have. We find that publications are more inclined to promote our store because of the new design, and vendors who have said ‘no’ to us in the past are now selling their products to us because of the improved, professional look. Sales are up 320%!”</p>
<h2 class="p3">Easy Migration and Preview Capabilities</h2>
<p class="p1">For customers migrating from our legacy theme development platform, we’ve included tools for an easy migration. Your SEO and product data will all transfer to your new theme, and with our theme preview capability, you’ll be able to see what your current store looks like on a new theme without any obligation to buy.</p>

<p class="p3">The platform just does the work for you. That really adds up.</p>
<p class="p3"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">John McCann, CEO of Spectrum Audio</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">“There are some built in things on the backend of BigCommerce that I think people don’t even notice, like automatic URL redirects that are built when you change a product title,” says John McCann, CEO of <a href="http://www.spectrumaudio.com/">Spectrum Audio</a>. “Stuff like that –– where the platform just does the work for you –– really adds up. You can import redirects into BigCommerce. Even if you have a developer who knows how to do that, you’re still paying him to do something that’s built into BigCommerce automatically.”</p>
<h2 class="p2">Built In One Page Checkout</h2>
<p class="p1">All new BigCommerce themes also come with a fully responsive one-page checkout and checkout editor that enables you to change the look and feel of your checkout, including button colors, fonts and checkout header.</p>

<p>This past summer, <a href="http://www.exxel.com/">Exxel Outdoors</a>, the parent company to multiple outdoor brands including <a href="https://kelty.com/">Kelty</a> and <a href="https://sierradesigns.com/">Sierra Design</a>s, overhauled all seven of their websites simultaneously.</p>
<p>Changing one website is a large task, but seven is a massive initiative, but Exxel saw a trend that they wanted to get in front of as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This major driver and trend was the fact that 40% of their traffic was coming from mobile, but their conversion rates were low. Hardly anyone on smaller devices was checking out.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>Trend lines show more than 50% of traffic to websites today are from mobile devices, but 75% of sales are attributed to desktop.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>That number is actually just short of industry average. Trend lines show more than 50% of traffic to websites today are from mobile devices, but <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2016/How-Mobile-is-Transforming-the-Digital-Commerce-Landscape">75% of sales are attributed to desktop</a>.</p>
<p>This is both a UX and CRO issue, or as both we and Exxel view this, a UX and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization/">CRO opportunity</a>.</p>
<p>Exxel’s overhaul focused on the mobile experience and they saw huge wins immediately, but we’ll get to that in a minute.</p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>The Mobile Opportunity</h3></p>
<p>Driving new traffic is difficult and expensive, but Exxel Outdoors saw a huge mobile optimization opportunity to both create happier customers and make more money from their existing traffic – resulting in a 147% increase in mobile conversions.</p>
<p></div>
<h2>The State of Mobile</h2>
<p>In 2014, we passed the <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/">mobile tipping point</a>.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18502 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1.png" alt="mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1" width="550" height="405" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1.png 550w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1-300x221.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p>Millennials and Generation Z use their phones more than any other device to browse and shop online. Mobile digital media time in the U.S. is now significantly higher at 51% compared to desktop at 42%. Afterall, popular social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat don’t even offer a desktop experience.</p>
<p>In 2017, with Google’s <a href="http://searchengineland.com/faq-google-mobile-first-index-262751">mobile index update</a>, mobile will become the de facto indexing source for your website.</p>

<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>While mobile usage is increasing, surpassing all other devices, mobile spend and sales in retail is lagging behind.</p>
<p>Of the top reasons why consumers do not convert on mobile according to a ComScore study, all but one are issues of user experience and mobile-friendly <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/best-ecommerce-website-design/">website design</a> from landing page to checkout.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18695 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mobile-first-tipping-points.png" alt="mobile-first-tipping-points" width="612" height="377" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mobile-first-tipping-points.png 612w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mobile-first-tipping-points-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<h2>Increase Your Revenue with Mobile-Friendly Design</h2>
</div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>147%</span></h3><br />
Percent increase in mobile conversions for Exxel Outdoor brands since the mobile-first relaunch of the company’s seven websites.<br />
</div><div class="post-detail__body-inner">
<p>Today, Exxel Outdoors has seen a <a href="http://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/retail-success-stories/exxel-outdoors-doubles-mobile-conversion-across-seven-e-commerce-brands">147% increase in mobile conversions</a> since re-launch.</p>
<p>In addition to an increase in mobile conversions and revenue, they reduced their bounce rates, decreased page load time and reduced hosting costs.</p>
<p>The team credits their <a href="http://mattjanaway.co.uk/introduction-ecommerce-growth-hacking/">growth success</a> to many factors –– a mobile-optimized website, product videos on all product pages, turning product pages into responsive landing pages and streamlined checkout –– all of them targeting a mobile customer’s desired experience and intent.</p>
<p>Their goal was to be mobile-first, not just mobile-friendly.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18696 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kelty-product-page-mobile.jpeg" alt="kelty-product-page-mobile" width="392" height="867" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kelty-product-page-mobile.jpeg 392w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kelty-product-page-mobile-300x664.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Kelty is one of Exxel Outdoors&#8217; most successful brands. </em></p>
<p>Of course, Exxel Outdoors’ brands aren’t the only ones benefitting immensely from a mobile-first focus.</p>
<p>Online stores like <a href="https://www.awesomegti.com/">AwesomeGTI</a>, <a href="https://www.storeyourboard.com/">StoreYourBoard</a> and <a href="https://www.knobs.co/">The Knobs Co</a> have seen similar results from their mobile audiences. Each of these brands have focused on turning <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-video-strategy/">product pages into landing pages</a>. They use <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-product-videos/">video</a>, honest customer reviews, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-rock-product-photography-on-a-budget/">product photos</a>, social media streams and clear Add to Cart buttons to do this.</p>
<p>Their success on mobile is thanks to going beyond mobile-friendly.</p>
<p>This is a drastic change.</p>
<p>It’s time brands leave left-over desktop functionality that doesn’t make sense on a mobile device behind. It’s time to design online experiences for mobile before all else.</p>
<h2>Introducing the First Theme Built for Mobile First</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18697" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/touch-mobile-first.png" alt="touch-mobile-first" width="750" height="375" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/touch-mobile-first.png 960w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/touch-mobile-first-300x150.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/touch-mobile-first-750x375.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
</div><div class="post-detail__callout post-detail__callout--left"><h3>See Touch in Action</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/touch-clean/">Test out all four Touch theme variants to see the new mobile-first theme in action right now</a>.</p>
<p></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner">
<p>BigCommerce is here to help.</p>
<p>Not every online store has the budget to hire developers and designers. And, even those that do often don’t have the time to A/B test concepts, or lay out all needs before hiring an agency or launching a new site.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve partnered with celebrity designer LaQuan Smith and design agency <a href="https://partners.bigcommerce.com/directory/partner/126594/pixel-union">Pixel Union</a> to launch the only fully customizable, mobile-first theme offered by an ecommerce platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/touch-clean/">Meet Touch</a>: an innovative combination of technical need and innovative UX.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/matuYHAwU60" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Touch is already being used by <a href="http://laquansmith.com/">the LaQuan Smith brand</a>, which has been optimizing for mobile first since early 2016. Among their mobile first experience updates are intuitive swipe left-right functionality, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> for quick checkout and high-quality images for familiar mobile app-like scanning and swiping.</p>
<p>“The Touch mobile-first design speaks so perfectly to my core customers, a large portion of whom are already making purchases on a mobile device. Touch just kicks the experience up a few notches by adding elements that improve that existing experience,” says Smith. “For starters the navigation, which relies on intuitive finger swipes to move between pieces of clothing, functions in much the same way that you would already use your phone.</p>
<div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p>The Touch mobile-first design speaks so perfectly to my core customers, a large portion of whom are already making purchases on a mobile device.</p>
<p><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div>
<p>“In my opinion, the coolest element of this theme is <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-checkout-page-optimization/">the seamless checkout experience</a>, which completely eliminates the frustrations we’ve all experienced when trying to check out on a mobile device,” says Smith. “Through Touch, customers can pay with a single touch using Apple Pay.”</p>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Browse All BigCommerce Mobile Themes</h3></p>
<p>BigCommerce also offers <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">87 responsive storefront designs</a> that integrate with Apple Pay and PayPal One Touch to help increase your mobile conversions.</p>
<p></div>
<h2>Apple Pay v. Chrome Mobile Checkout</h2>
<p>It is one thing to use a mobile-first site design and UX, but another to enable quick, convenient and trust-worthy checkout on mobile. Yet, as LaQuan mentioned, mobile checkout improvements like Apple Pay and PayPal One Touch are quickly decreasing mobile <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">abandoned cart rates</a>. Apps using Apple Pay since September of 2016 have already <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apple-pay/">increased conversion rates 2x</a>.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-18709 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/apple-pay-mobile-first.png" alt="apple-pay-mobile-first" width="454" height="454" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/apple-pay-mobile-first.png 454w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/apple-pay-mobile-first-300x300.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/apple-pay-mobile-first-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></p>
<p>To understand exactly how mobile wallets and one-touch checkouts are doing this, just take a look at the time to checkout difference on OverStock.com between Apple Pay and a regular mobile checkout flow.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GWHYan1EweM" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><center><em>Apple Pay checkout flow in Safari</em></center><center></center><center></center><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C84X7OAFOA4" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><center><em>Mobile checkout flow in Chrome</em></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amount of time spent is vastly different. Apple Pay and similar solutions are leading the path to mobile checkout optimization, making it even more important for brands to create a mobile-first design that leads users to the optimized checkout.</p>
<p>After all, in 2017, retail will serve mobile audiences before all else. The time is now to make sure your site is ready. Updating to a mobile-first theme is a great step – especially if you are a retailer with higher volumes of traffic coming from mobile than desktop.</p>
<p>For brands which have yet to see mobile traffic surpass desktop, know that the time will come. Before then, be sure you are using a responsive theme and signaling to search engines like Google that your product pages are engaging (i.e. great product photography and video) and kept up to date with fresh content (i.e. customer reviews).</p>
<p>Mobile is no longer a choice. It is the new reality. And with it comes massive mobile revenue opportunities from your existing and future traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Stay tuned in 2017 for additional updates and more data on mobile conversions and the future of online shopping.</strong></p>

Traffic is getting more expensive.</p>
<p class="p1">Since Google’s SERP update to remove right-hand rail ads, CPC to maintain a top position on Google has <a href="http://searchengineland.com/trend-observation-branded-ppc-ads-experience-increased-costs-247832">increased more than 60%</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-18501" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cpc-cost-increase.png" alt="cpc cost increase" width="750" height="435" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cpc-cost-increase.png 791w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cpc-cost-increase-300x174.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cpc-cost-increase-750x435.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://searchengineland.com/trend-observation-branded-ppc-ads-experience-increased-costs-247832">Source </a></p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__callout-percentage"><h3><span>44%</span></h3></p>
<p class="p1">Percent of consumers who start their product search on Amazon</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">That’s just the cost of keeping your site ahead of your immediate competitor’s around the world. You also have <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/selling-on-amazon/">Amazon</a>, eBay, Facebook and Instagram. The latter two, according to Facebook’s first quarter 2016 results, already occupy <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html">nearly an hour</a> of your customer’s time per day online.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result of this, retail marketers are tasked with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">competing on all channels</a> –– Facebook, Google Shopping, Amazon, eBay, Pinterest –– and through all mediums –– paid, organic, affiliate, social and more.</p>
<p class="p1">It sounds like a lot because it is.</p>
<p class="p1">It sounds potentially overwhelming because it could be. How do you prioritize and know where to focus your efforts?</p>
<p class="p1">Proactive marketers and ecommerce owners actually see this <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/multi-channel-selling/">expanding multi-channel complexity as an opportunity</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Each of these channels is on the lookout for engaging content. Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, Google –– every single one of them are looking for ways to better serve their customers and to add more value to their visitors.</p>
<p class="p1">This is a complex task because traditional value adds are no longer as effective as they used to be. It’s why you’ve seen so many Google and Facebook algorithm updates. It’s why you’ve seen Amazon testing so many beta projects. It’s why all of your ad formats and options are in constant flux.</p>
<p class="p1">And the surge in mobile traffic is a large driver.</p>
<p class="p1">Mobile users don’t interact with content in the same way desktop users do. And, mobile internet usage has surpassed that of desktop.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-18502 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1.png" alt="mobile stats vs desktop users" width="550" height="405" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1.png 550w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Mobile-stats-vs-desktop-users-global-550x405-1-300x221.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/">Source</a></p>
<p class="p1">This is where video comes in. Video engagement from mobile devices is incredibly high. Just take a look at the numbers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html">from YouTube</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">More than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html">half of YouTube views</a> come from mobile devices</li>
<li class="p1">The average mobile viewing session is 40 minutes</li>
<li class="p1">YouTube’s mobile audience alone reaches more 18-34 and 18-49 year-olds than any cable network in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Supercharge your YouTube Growth</h3></p>
<p>Read the free guide to <a href="https://grin.co/free-youtube-subscribers/">growing your YouTube subscriber base</a> and building an additional, visual sales channel.</p>
<p></div>
<p class="p1">Compare that with other channels, like Google or Facebook, and here is what you get:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">YouTube, the world’s second largest search engine, is owned by Google, the world’s largest search engine. Videos now appear in <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/product-videos-conversion/">70% of the top 100 search result listings</a>.</li>
<li class="p3">Facebook receives more than 1.5 billion visits per month –– more than any other online channel. YouTube is a close second, with 1 billion unique visitors per month.</li>
<li class="p3">Facebook’s algorithm updates often demote branded content from the feeds of many users, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-advertising-guide/">unless those brands pay to promote the content</a> beyond a small sample of their already existing audience. But <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/some-publishers-worry-about-viability-of-branded-videos-on-facebook-1472059615">branded video posts still do remarkably well</a>, many garnering millions of views. A video posted by NowThisNews featuring Kleenex garnered 9.3 million views, for instance.</li>
</ul>
<p><center></center></p>
<p class="p1">Video is the most compelling way to engage consumers, especially those coming from mobile devices. Create high-quality videos, and even the major industry players you compete against will push your content to the top of user feeds.</p>
<p class="p1">Better yet, use those videos on your own website and you’ll increase conversions and AOV.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">88% of <a href="http://www.videocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/VideoCommerce2.pdf">surveyed business owners</a> and ecommerce managers say product page video has increased conversions</li>
<li class="p3"><a href="http://www.videocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/VideoCommerce2.pdf">69% increased AOV</a> for sites featuring video on product pages</li>
<li class="p3">Consumers are <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/product-videos-conversion/">64-85%</a> more likely to buy a product after viewing a product video</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p1">How Kelty Increased Mobile Conversions 147%</h2>
<p class="p1">Video and increased mobile revenue simply go hand-in-hand. And outdoor retailer Kelty can prove it.</p>
<p class="p1">Earlier in 2016, the brand <a href="http://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/retail-success-stories/exxel-outdoors-doubles-mobile-conversion-across-seven-e-commerce-brands">redesigned and relaunched the entire site</a> –– focusing on an improved mobile UX. As part of that overhaul, product videos were created for nearly all product pages in an effort to bolster merchandising efforts.</p>
<p class="p4">“Mobile is very important to us,” said Cory Barnes, Digital Marketing Manager for Exxel Outdoors. “If you look at the percentage of visitors that are using mobile devices or tablets, the number increases every year. We expect that trend to continue and we want to make sure that someone on our site is having a great experience no matter what device they’re on.”</p>
<p class="p1">For Kelty, mobile conversions since the redesign are up 147%</p>

<p class="p1">That’s the power of video, and the purpose of this guide. In it, you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p3">How to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-video-strategy/">develop a video marketing strategy</a> for a variety of channels, including email nurture streams, SEO, social media and more</li>
<li class="p3">Which marketing channels will drive which KPIs, including <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/product-video-conversion/">increasing traffic, conversions, AOV or all three</a></li>
<li class="p3">What it takes to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/product-video/">produce a quality video</a>, with a checklist even the most novice marketer can follow (and one that experts would be wise to always have on hand)</li>
<li class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/product-video-conversion/">Actionable steps from industry experts</a> including Alex Birkett and Adii Pienaar on how to use video to increase conversions and generate ROI</li>

Good. Data from the National Retail Federation suggests parents are strategically waiting until the last minute to buy back-to-school goods –– looking for deals and discounts.</p>
<p class="p1">And, according to a BigCommerce survey, parents spend <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/omni-channel-retail/">61% more online per year</a> as well as 75% more time searching for online products per week than non-parents. These two data points suggest that while parents are spending more online than average shoppers, they are also browsing for the best deals before converting.</p>
<p class="p1">Convenience plays a heavy role for parents as well –– the vast majority of whom use Amazon before independent websites for online purchases. The appeal of one-stop shopping addresses both shipping cost concerns and the play on convenience, allowing parents to buy all items they need from a single site and receive the goods within a specified, and trusted, timeframe. Plus, Amazon often promises parents the lowest possible price.</p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-16943" title="Back-to-School Shopping Trends" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Parents-Plan-to-Get-Savvy-with-Back-to-School-Back-to-College-Spending-National-Retail-Federation.png" alt="Back-to-School Tips" width="690" height="424" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Parents-Plan-to-Get-Savvy-with-Back-to-School-Back-to-College-Spending-National-Retail-Federation.png 690w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Parents-Plan-to-Get-Savvy-with-Back-to-School-Back-to-College-Spending-National-Retail-Federation-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></center></p>
<p class="p1">In all, capturing back-to-school sales from frugal, time-crunched parents is an exercise is empathy –– and in a changing commerce environment.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;A strategy of just a banner ad does not fully embrace the shift that mom and dad have made to all forms of digital content, whether they be mobile gaming, extensive video consumption and overall the propensity they have for doing mobile shopping,&#8221; Rubicon Project&#8217;s chief communications officer Dallas Lawrence said in an <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/parents-are-increasingly-using-mobile-devices-back-school-shopping-172370">interview with AdWeek</a>. &#8220;Smart brands are going to be embracing a very comprehensive advertising strategy over the next two months to capture the billions of dollars these parents plan to spend online and on mobile getting their kids ready for school.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Below are 14 back-to-school shopping tips on how to win shoppers to boost your sales before the holiday rush.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Build Momentum with New Tech Products</h2>
<p class="p1">The number one thing parents are buying for their kids for back-to-school? <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/parents-are-increasingly-using-mobile-devices-back-school-shopping-172370">Technology.</a></p>
<p class="p1">We’re not just talking college-bound kids getting new computers or those in Calculus I needing a calculator. Half of parents of students who are in kindergarten to eighth grade plan on shopping for tablets.</p>
<p class="p1">If you sell electronics, back-to-school is a great time to be strategic with your incentives and offer special deals. If you are in a related industry, consider offering promotions around electronics, such as a discount on cell phone cases or free customization for laptop bags.</p>
<p class="p1">It isn’t a bad idea for any store looking to increase profits around back-to-school to invest in a dropshipper or use Alibaba to source new inventory and gain loyal customers. To do so, integrate a dropshipper or a sourcing agency –– like Alibaba –– within your backend and populate your store with available electronics or electronic accessories.</p>
<p class="p1">You could also work with other retailers to source these items. Consider working with brands like <a href="http://sonofasailor.co/">Son of a Sailor</a>, which offers these goods through wholesale relationships with other retailers. This is a craftier way to source products for your site, and a good way to give back to the independent maker and store owner community.</p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-16940" title="Back-to-School Shopping Trends Tech" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.37.12-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-18 at 1.37.12 PM" width="418" height="422" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.37.12-PM.png 418w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.37.12-PM-300x303.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.37.12-PM-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" /></center></p>
<p class="p1">Keep in mind that with a dropshipper, you will lose control over your branding when it comes to packaging. This might be worth the loss, though, if you can gain enough profits and repeat customers from the back-to-school season.</p>
<p class="p1">For sourcing agencies, you will need to house the inventory yourself, but will be guaranteed on product quality and timing of shipping from the supplier. Plus, you will have final say on your shipping, branding and overall delivery experience.</p>
<p class="p1">All three of these options are great ways to expand your inventory, test out new product options and overall scale your operations. Just be sure to think through your current capabilities and business growth needs in order to choose the option best fit for your firm.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Be Present on Social</h2>
<p class="p1">You’ll want to prepare for success and lay some groundwork to ensure a successful back-to-school shopping season. Start by extending your social media reach by promoting your accounts with a paid promotion campaign. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-promoting-social-posts/">Grow your followers</a> now so that your brand can go into competitive shopping seasons with a larger and more engaged audience. Then, use your social accounts to nurture shoppers through the back-to-school rush by sharing useful content such as shopping lists or product-specific discounts.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>“Every business touches back to school in some way, even if it&#8217;s simply that your customer or clients have kids.” says <a href="https://equalman.com/">Erik Qualman</a>, a #1 best selling author and motivational speaker. “If you can find something that resonates with everyone that can tie back to what you do, that is gold. For example if you are a spa, message out: ‘It&#8217;s his first day of school and he dropped his new iPad in the toilet. It&#8217;s time for some Mommy Time. 30% off all Spa Treatments Moms. #BackToSchool.’”</em></p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to social media advertising, be sure to put your effort in where it counts. Among adults ages 30-49, <a href="http://sproutsocial.com/insights/new-social-media-demographics/#facebook">73% use Facebook</a>. Instagram and even Snapchat are gaining in popularity, but Facebook still wins out due to its highly-targeted ad network as well as <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/facebook-shop/">Shop section</a>. If you had to only choose one, Facebook is likely the social media platform to provide the biggest return on investment.</p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-16941" title="Back-to-School Shopping Trends Social" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.43.54-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-18 at 1.43.54 PM" width="750" height="556" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.43.54-PM.png 845w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.43.54-PM-300x222.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.43.54-PM-750x556.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></center></p>
<p class="p1">Although maintaining a well-rounded social presence is vital for any business, consider putting most of your social media advertising dollars behind <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-ad-analytics/">Facebook ads</a> for the back-to-school season and launching your Facebook Shop section. Millennial moms multitask, browsing Facebook as they research products, reading product reviews and passing along insight to their fellow moms. Having a strong presence on Facebook through product posts and promoted ads will help you catch their attention.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>“There are so many things that mid-market retailers can do to attract back to school shoppers on social media, such as launching an influencer marketing campaign, creating creative Snapchat geofilters, creating a fresh Instagram campaign, or utilizing Facebook Live or Periscope to get the word out via livestreaming. These are all organic activities that mid-market retailers should be doing on a daily basis. The one thing that trumps all of these –– and will continue to do so –– is leveraging paid social in a very targeted way.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Most of the social networks offer advertising platforms with very sophisticated targeting capabilities. From retargeting website visitors and those in your email marketing list to reaching out to new targeted social media users, there is no better way to get the word out about your back-to-school specials to your past and present customers as well as a relevant lookalike audience that has the potential to be your new customers through targeting them via very creative visual advertisements, using both photo and video.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>The additional benefit of doing so is that the ROI of your back-to-school campaign can be clearly calculated, and any gains made in social media will carry over to augment your current community, giving your company lasting benefits to come.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>–– Neal Schaffer, CEO, <a href="http://maximizeyoursocial.com/">Maximize Your Social</a></em></p>
<h2 class="p1">Let Your Customers Do the Talking</h2>
<p class="p1">Speaking of moms on Facebook, don’t forget the significance of an honest recommendation from one parent to another. In an effort to efficiently spend your marketing budget, let your customers fuel word-of-mouth marketing through a giveaway. Everyone likes free stuff. And what better way to energize your fans while getting the word out about your brand?</p>
<p class="p1">This back-to-school season, create contests where entrants can win free products and discounts. Can’t take the hit this month? Offer customers discounts for the upcoming holiday season in exchange for a higher average order value. This will increase your repeat customer base as well as your customer lifetime value.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, back-to-school shoppers are looking for deals. Any way you can gamify the shopping process, add discounts for higher order value or decrease shipping costs, the most likely you are to win the sale.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Appeal to the Idealists</h2>
<p class="p1">This back-to-school season, appeal to your audience’s emotions through high quality product photos. You don’t need to be a photography expert or even have professional equipment. If you have a <a href="http://blog.bigcommerce.com/smartphone-product-images/">smartphone</a>, you’re good to go.</p>
<p class="p1">As you pick images for landing pages and social ads, consider including people in your shots. Nothing appeals to a parent’s heartstrings like a Pinterest-perfect photo of a little one with a lunch box in hand, ready for their first day. Consider how <a href="http://www.myfunkins.com/">Funkins</a> uses pictures of children in a school setting for their marketing.</p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-16944" title="Back-to-School Shopping Trends Photography" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/funkins-back-to-school.jpeg" alt="funkins-back-to-school" width="390" height="585" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/funkins-back-to-school.jpeg 390w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/funkins-back-to-school-300x450.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /></center></p>
<h2 class="p1">Resurface Product Videos</h2>
<p class="p1">With back-to-school preparations keeping you busy, shooting and editing new product videos may not be at the top of your to-do list. That’s OK. Now is a perfect time to resurface old product videos and circulate them through your social media channels.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iz56prGBiS8" width="750" height="563" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">Remember, <a href="http://blog.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-video-strategy/">4x as many</a> customers would rather watch a video about a product than read about it. And, as you strive to reach the millennial crowd, posting a video on your favorite back-to-school trends for 2016 is another opportunity to attract shoppers to your site. Among 18 to 24-year-olds, <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248460">22% say</a> they turn to YouTube to find out what is cool to purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">So, for sites gearing their back-to-school online shopping toward a college-aged audience, YouTube is likely your best bet for reeling in customers with the highest order value.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Consider Shipping Incentives</h2>
<p class="p1">Back-to-school is a great time to appeal to the <a href="https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/after-splurging-2014-families-trim-back-school-spending-2015">92% of shoppers</a> who are hoping to save some money. For small businesses, free shipping offers are vital to compete with big box retailers like Wal-Mart or Target.</p>
<p class="p1">While it may not be right for your business to offer free shipping all of the time, consider how it can help boost your sales during a competitive second-half. If margins are your main concern here, see if you can use some of the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">budget allocated to marketing</a> for demand generation in order to offset the cost of providing free shipping. After all, according to a study by <a href="https://www.synchronyfinancial.com/Synchrony_Financial_Digital_Retail_Strategies_white_paper_June_2015.pdf">Synchrony Financial</a>, 75% of shoppers say they are more likely to choose a retailer with free shipping.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Send Timely Email Nurtures</h2>
<p class="p1">Direct email marketing can be a great way to reach your audience, especially if those emails contain valuable, useful content. Nobody likes spam, but everyone loves a good promotion. According to a recent study from Loyalty360, <a href="http://www.business2community.com/brandviews/makesbridge/4-reasons-why-email-marketing-is-an-asset-for-small-businesses-01275579#cJHPAFmf2cxRrTrF.99">59% of U.S. mothers</a> would sign up for email updates if more prizes were offered. Take a look at a recent email from <a href="http://www.getyubo.com/">Yubo</a>, maker of fun, eco-friendly lunchboxes, offering free shipping for early bird shoppers who spend at least $49.</p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-16945" title="Back-to-School Shopping Trends Email" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-21-at-8.49.10-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-21 at 8.49.10 AM" width="482" height="584" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-21-at-8.49.10-AM.png 482w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-21-at-8.49.10-AM-300x363.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" /></center></p>
<p class="p1">Focusing their email offers on rewarding volume of orders, the retailer says, “We send out more newsletters within the back-to-school season than we do all year. We have many promos and discounts going on throughout the season.”</p>
<h2 class="p1">Identify with the Season’s Stress</h2>
<p class="p1">Although the spending predictions may not be as high as 2014, retailers can use parents’ back-to-school planning to their advantage. More than 30% of parents plan to compare prices online before they make their purchases.</p>
<p class="p1">Retailers will benefit from helping parents through the research process, whether it’s through recommendations on your website’s landing page or product features on your social media channels. One idea to help parents through the busy season while affirming their desire to shop strategically is to publish back-to-school shopping lists. Point out the top trends and go-to items — all while featuring a few of your own products.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, utilize <a href="http://blog.bigcommerce.com/on-site-search-conversions/">site search capabilities</a> to make it easier for customers to locate items and add them to their cart. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/nextopia-site-search-navigation/">Nextopia</a> can help many online stores set up this feature and have it ready to go just in time for the busiest part of the season.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Connect with Bloggers</h2>
<p class="p1">When it comes to rethinking your marketing strategies for the back-to-school season, don’t underestimate the mommy bloggers. Bloggers can be one of the greatest tools for brand advocacy. Bridging the gap between your brand and the consumer, bloggers can help build trust and customer loyalty through personalized and positive reviews. And, believe it or not, bloggers want to help you, too. <a href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/importance-cultivating-symbiotic-relationships-professional-mom-bloggers-infographic">Five out of nine bloggers</a> are interested in becoming spokespeople for brands.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>“Influencer marketing can be your best friend to target back to school shoppers and engage them through those who already have their eyeballs –– and attention,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/Shama?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Shama Hyder</a>, CEO and founder of <a href="http://marketingzen.com/">The Marketing Zen Group</a>. “Any client we’ve launched an influencer marketing campaign for has seen double digit growth. The key is finding the right influencer and then working with them strategically for maximum impact.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">While Twitter is a great resource to find bloggers, email is the traditional way to send a pitch. Take time to follow thought leaders in your industry and pick your bloggers to reach out to carefully. Then, do your research. Look into the types of blogs the writer has done in the past and gauge whether they were paid or voluntary. <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogger-outreach-tools">Hubspot suggests</a> avoiding mass emails in favor of personalized messages.</p>
<p class="p1">A great tool for finding influencers in your industry is <a href="http://www.buzzstream.com/">BuzzStream Discovery</a>. You can sort your search by number of followers, timeframe in which they last posted about your industry niche, website domain and more.</p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-16939" title="Back-to-School Shopping Trends BuzzStream" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.52.12-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-18 at 1.52.12 PM" width="750" height="396" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.52.12-PM.png 1327w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.52.12-PM-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-18-at-1.52.12-PM-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></center></p>
<h2 class="p1">Don’t Forget the College Crowd</h2>
<p class="p1">Although school-aged children tend to be the focus of the season, it’s the college students that plan to spend the most money. While school-aged children yield an average of $630, college students spend upwards of $899. This translates to a total of $43.1 billion in back-to-college sales.</p>
<p class="p1">As you strategize for this millennial generation, brainstorm special promotions you can form around technology or dorm decor. For example, the <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/07/21/back-to-school-sales-could-be-big-for-retailers.aspx">International Council of Shopping Centers</a> predicts a shift in technology sales with more students looking at tablets over laptops. Coordinate your product offerings with similar technology trends.</p>
<p class="p1">Catering to a student’s personal style will help guide them through the overwhelming process of college shopping. Target’s <a href="http://adage.com/article/acxiom/target-taps-millenial-market-back-school-push/299675/">Made for U College Styler</a>, for example, analyzes shoppers’ social media profiles and delivers product suggestions based on trends in their posts. Instagram posts help suggest color schemes, while Facebook likes feed the app with the shoppers interests.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Think like a Penny Pincher</h2>
<p class="p1">As parents look to be as efficient as possible in their back-to-school shopping, remember that August is the time for many state’s sales tax holidays. <a href="http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sales_holiday.html">Look up</a> when your state’s days are and expect for frugal parents to do the same. Be prepared for an increase in orders on these days and consider offering additional promotions. Also, consider informing your customers through social media about these days — parents will love you for the reminder.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, too, that the lowest price doesn’t always win and the last thing you want is to get stuck in the middle of a pricing battle that can hurt your margins. Instead, focus on your unique selling proposition or brand positioning. Think about what makes you different from your competitors and use that to your advantage. For online retailers, this could mean excellent customer support, free shipping, fast delivery or exclusive product offerings.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>“Be sure to use the keyword phrase ‘back to school’ in all appropriate product titles and descriptions. Some other relevant phrases are ‘back to school clothes,’ ‘back to school outfits,’ and ‘back to school supplies,’ says Danna Crawford, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://powersellingmom.com/">PowerSellingMom</a>.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>“Also, little things can mean big sales. Offer a free pack of #2 pencils with purchase! Or, have lots of smaller items ready to sell as add-ons. You&#8217;d be surprised how easily a $19.99 purchase becomes a $49.99 purchase!”</em></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em>Check out <strong><em><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/wisepricer-pricing-and-merchandising-solution/">WisePricer</a>, a </em></strong>one-click BigCommerce integration for automated competitive pricing.</em></strong></p>
<h2 class="p1">Feed the Trendsetters</h2>
<p class="p1">Help your customers be the best-dressed on their first day. Stay up to date on the latest trends by reading parenting and teen magazines, especially if you are in the fashion industry. <a href="http://blog.bigcommerce.com/google-fashion-trend-report/">Google’s fashion trend report</a> is another way stay on top of shopper’s wants and seasonal trends.</p>
<p class="p1">As students flock back to shops, both on and off-line, you’ll want to be sure you have what they are looking for.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are running low on stock or inventory based on the current trends, try out different sourcing options. Again, dropshipping or third-party sourcing through Alibaba may not be your ideal long-term solution, but it can help to provide enough metrics for your business to made a data-driven decision to onboard those items as part of your overall business strategy.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Don’t be Surprised by Latecomers</h2>
<p class="p1">Although some students look to be the trendsetters, others hold back and wait for school to begin before they start shopping. Consider this akin to being a little bit tardy as kids get back into the habit of waking up early for class. Be sure, then, to prepare your inventory for both sets of shoppers. Once you have a good idea of what items are selling well, stay above the curve and maintain your stock for the late-comers.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Be Mobile First</h2>
<p class="p1">As with all modern ecommerce initiatives, make sure your campaigns are mobile-friendly.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>“Be sure to use mobile to reach back-to school shoppers,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/Rieva?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Rieva Lesonsky</a>, CEO and President of <a href="http://www.smallbizdaily.com/">SmallBizDaily</a>. “A study from AOL shows:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>73% of shoppers research products on mobile devices</em></li>
<li><em>66% use mobile coupons</em></li>
<li><em>61% read product reviews on mobile</em></li>
<li><em>55% compare prices on mobile devices</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>This study is two years old, and we know mobile usage has increased!”</em></p>
<p class="p1">In all, to reap the rewards of back-to-school shopping, you need to start early, appeal to your target audience and make sure to bundle items as much as possible in order to beat out the offerings by your competition. Back-to-school sales can also help as you begin to strategize around your holiday promotions. Anything you do now to impress customers will likely be a reason for them to come back when holiday shopping begins.</p>

Further contributing to conversion issues are leading marketplaces like Amazon or eBay, where consumers have become accustomed to a particular way of shopping, a large part of why more than half of them begin their online product search on those platforms.</p>
<p class="p1">Independent stores are <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-trends/">losing out on mindshare</a> here –– and while search engine optimization helps drive the other half of online shoppers who begin their product search on Google, one thing is abundantly clear: the function of individual online stores has fundamentally changed.</p>
<p class="p1">In the current omni-channel retail environment, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">online storefronts</a> are no longer simply a brand’s digital checkout. They must be also shopping destinations providing unique online experiences unparalleled by competitors or the industry at large. Your ecommerce website is a form of media –– owned media –– and you must begin thinking of it in this way.</p>
<p class="p1">Doug Stephens of the <a href="http://www.retailprophet.com/blog/the-store-is-media-and-media-is-the-store/" target="_blank">Retail Prophet</a> suggests that brands today need “to move hearts and minds – to sell the idea, essence and values of the brand  – all of which has more traditionally been viewed as the role of media.”</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;About a year ago, we made the decision to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration/">replatform</a> from our old, slow, outdated, hard-to-maintain ecommerce platform to BigCommerce. We knew that our design had begun to show its age, so we wanted to use the opportunity to rebuild from the ground up. We hired our first web designer, and set to work creating the new maruccisports.com.</p>
<p>Our primary source of design inspiration was our vast library of player shots with Big League baseball players. When we set out to design the site during the move to BigCommerce, we wanted to build layouts that highlighted the amazing relationships we have with these players. Our overarching goal was to interweave the story of Marucci, which was founded by two former Big Leaguers, into every page on the site. We have a ton to be proud of, and we wanted to showcase that to the world.</p>
<p>The new design was built from the ground up to focus on mobile devices (which represent over 60% of our traffic). Since our launch in November, we’ve seen a 50% increase in our mobile conversions, and a 24% increase in our tablet conversions.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;When you enter our site, you are immediately immersed in our products and brand. From there, users explore cheeses, cured meats, and our gift offering to discover something new and exciting &#8211; we love knowing they are feeling inspired and will have a phenomenal experience while enjoying or gifting our products.</p>
<p class="p1">One of our favorite features is the short descriptions on the products when you are viewing them in the product category pages. If you are interested in trying a new cheese, you can browse through and select based on images and get a short preview of what the cheese tastes like or what makes it special.  Knowing people have a sense of discovery when looking through our site is really energizing and mimics the customer experience in store as close as possible.</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;We are constantly changing our e-commerce website. It was a natural process of evolving with the digital age. We found over the past year that roughly 75% of our new users are on mobile and tablet platforms. Our development team wanted to focus on &#8216;mobile first&#8217; design so we started testing our design concept on mobile devices. We pulled a lot of inspiration from the best practices while implementing customer feedback we have received since the company started. We never want to become complacent, and have always evolved to provide our customers the best experience we can offer.</p>
<p class="p1">Since our latest design update in April, our mobile conversion rate has increased by 1.24%. We have also seen an increase in our desktop conversion rate by 1%. Overall, we are having around a 4-5% conversion rate with our daily 10k users, something we haven’t seen since our huge holiday rush during December. We have also decreased our bounce rate on mobile by 11% and desktop bounce rate has decreased by 5%&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">Considering the amount of websites that are hosted on BigCommerce, I should admit I was pleasantly surprised to learn that SISU was chosen as one of the most excellent on this platform. I am very pleased to receive this award pleased because it is an award recognizing our exceptional marketing team, our phenomenal partners and above all, the customers who are the strongest brand advocates of SISU Mouthguards. And, I have to express my gratitude to all the SISU fans who were excited about our nomination and worked so hard to help us win.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;We decided it was a great time for a redesign because we were <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/free-ecommerce-rfp-template/">replatforming our ecommerce website</a> and transitioning over to BigCommerce. We had some navigation issues on desktop and a separate mobile site that didn’t make for a seamless user experience. We were inspired by some of the other leading outdoor brand’s sites and their clean aesthetic, lifestyle driven photography, as well as the responsive designs we were seeing from those competitors.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">This is the first redesign that the current team was a part of, but we can happily say that metrics are up year over year. There are certainly a lot of factors involved, but the updated user experience has had positive effect on conversion. We’re also excited about the flexibility that working with BigCommerce has provided. With lower development costs, we’re able to experiment and work with new vendors that can potentially bring more value to the consumer.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Our design was driven by the redesign of our store logo – a mid-century modern sunburst with our store name at the top, and a tagline below. We were searching for a store theme that would allow us to feature the logo, centered, on the storefront.  We also wanted a theme that had a lot of white/negative space so that the store theme would showcase the items on our store, rather than overshadow them.</p>
<p class="p1">Upgrading to a BigCommerce-designed theme was a huge win for us. We now have complete control over the minor changes we wish to make on our store, and our customers have noticed, too! Everyone remarks on the beautiful design and comments on what a clean store we have. We find that publications are more inclined to promote our store because of the new design, and vendors who have said &#8216;no&#8217; to us in the past are now selling their products to us because of the improved, professional look. We adopted the new theme in the second quarter of 2015.</p>
<p class="p1">Comparing our stats from 2014, here is what we saw:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Store sales went up 320%</li>
<li class="p1">Orders increased 450%</li>
<li class="p1">Conversion rates increased 410%</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For 2016, we don’t have visibility on all of our stats, due to some changes on the backend of the store. But, when comparing numbers for the same time period in 2015, this is what we are seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Store sales are up 43%</li>
<li class="p1">Visitors are up 35%</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">We’re very happy with the choice we made to move forward with a new theme – it’s made our business a hugely successful one.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Initially, I set out to do a small brand refresh, and as I got deeper into it, it became clear that the website, as our number one information source to mamas, needed to reflect our brand and mission more accurately. The challenge was to showcase the loving bond between mama and baby while at the same time, the reality of the challenges that come with breastfeeding and pumping.</p>
<p class="p1">While not necessarily &#8216;sexy&#8217; or glamorous, nourishing a little human being is pretty remarkable and I wanted that to reflect in our site. As I delved deeper into what that looked like, it became obvious that the website needed a major overhaul, with true to life photography and more ease of use and navigability for sleep deprived and time constrained mamas.</p>
<p class="p1">This is my second design. The original was done completely on my own. Most of the photos were of myself in the product and shot against a white wall. It really feels like this site is so much more professional and, of course, that does contribute to increased sales and traffic.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;We believe a visit to a company’s website is the first impression to a potential customer. Sure, a customer may have seen us on a third party website or come across our product through one of their friends; however, it isn’t until you visit a company’s website for the first time when you get a real sense of who they are and what they are all about. With that in mind, we kept the different thoughts that would run through our customer’s head when visiting our home page. No matter what our customer is looking for, navigating through our website should lead them right to where they need to go.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;For over a decade, our service was known as <span class="il">Missions</span> <span class="il">Linked</span>. We started a rebrand and decided that we also wanted to change our name to Commission Creative. Our existing ecommerce web design was outdated and wasn’t responsive. Our new custom ecommerce website design was a central part of the rebrand as it&#8217;s the way most of our customers find us. The process started with a new logo and brand identity. Our goal was to create an interface that showed off our design work and explained the why behind what we do as well as how simple the process is. This was a challenge because we aren’t simply selling a product, but a design service with a printed product included as well as some design only products.</p>
<p class="p1">This iteration is version seven of our site, counting our previous name. It’s our second custom design we have done on the BigCommerce platform. We have seen 2% increase in goal conversions since the launch, compared to the same period the previous year. Average order value is up 4.4%. The abandoned cart recovery feature and email integration with MailChimp has helped with conversions as well. Taking into account that we also just did a name change, we think the site is performing well.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;<span class="s1">My site design came about through collaboration with a company called Esctasoft. I had the design concept in my mind. I wanted a site that was simple, clean, cheerful and would play off the logo. From that point, Esctasoft started work and I continued to give feedback through completion. When I first started, I was still deciding what exactly I wanted to sell, along the way, those ideas changed and I settled on the matching concept after going to buy a dress for myself and wishing I was able to purchase one for my daughter. After the slight redesign, I started to have more traffic and conversions on the website and got my first sale a few months later.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;After transitioning from WordPress, we sought a design that was easy for soccer referees to find what they needed.

<p class="p1">&#8220;While a large percentage of our business comes from dedicated landscape lighting designers we also cater to those new to business and coming from professions like landscape design, irrigation, lawn maintenance, etc. We needed to build a digital solution that not only made sense for the typical customer but one that helped our novice customer make experienced pro choices.</p>
<p class="p1">This is our first design for this site and it is still a constant work in progress. I think it is important to note that my team has worked with enterprise solutions such as Demandware and Mozu, in addition to more budget friendly platforms such as Volusion and Shopify. This same store with identical functionality on the Demandware or Mozu platforms would have cost us $250,000 to build and then an additional $100k to $500k per year for the platform.</p>
<p class="p1">The amazing part is that the BigCommerce platform has more certified partners capable of quality custom code work, it is in many ways more customizable than any other enterprise solution and the store hasn’t gone down once since launch. I truly believe that BigCommerce will quickly become the death of many of these very outdated million dollar commerce solutions.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Beyond having a user friendly website, we wanted the design to reflect the fun and joy associated with playgrounds. This is why we chose very bold and bright colors, and used photos that captured the happiness of kids playing. The website very much fits in line with what we are selling and who our products are for, and that was one of our biggest goals with the site design.</p>
<p class="p1">We worked with Eamon Rodeck and his awesome team at <a href="http://www.sproutcommerce.com/index.php">Sprout Commerce</a> (now Weizen Young). They were absolutely wonderful to work with and had the expertise to make it happen. We love the end result.</p>
<p class="p1">This was not our first redesign, but the first time we addressed many best practices for conversion rate optimization as well as making the site entirely mobile friendly. Because our previous design was not terrible, we did not see any huge gains in conversion rates, however, I think the new design put us in the best possible position for future growth and needs of our customers as they expect to shop more on their phones and tablets.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;The site was inspired by the simplicity of modern layouts, including larger simpler buttons, white spacing, reactive banners and marketing forms. The simplicity of adding an existing template to a BigCommerce store gave our partner – Selawik Retail – the flexibility to customize the design without having to change code.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the biggest changes we made was to the ‘Add To Cart’ button. Simply changing it from black to a blue color has <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">reduced abandoned carts</a> by up to 50%.</p>
<p class="p1">We are at the first stages of our development program for our ecommerce site. Using the OneViewPlus CMS from Selawik Retail to manage our product catalogue has also been a huge advantage, as we are easily able to create multi-variants that sync with our BigCommerce store and our EPOS system as well as give us real-time multi-location stock control.&#8221;</p>

Revenue has grown about 70% YoY and this has led to 5x revenue currently as compared to the initial design.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;The design was inspired by our clothing collection, Claridge + King. C + K is a line of women’s clothing inspired — in large part — by the classicism found in menswear tailoring and the natural fabrics utilized. Like menswear pieces that often don&#8217;t date as quickly as trend-driven fashions for women do, our desire was to create a timeless, beautiful site design that felt fresh.</p>
<p class="p1">We also aimed to make it very user friendly for our online customers, not only in an easy-to-navigate site, but we designed specific customizations like our Toolbox on each product page that houses important details that make the buying process easier for a first-time or longtime customer. This includes sizing charts specific to that particular garment to details on the garment&#8217;s care.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Our company sells environmental safety products, everything from hazardous containment for ebola to the collection and reusing of rainwater at home. We were inspired to create a design that flowed well and held onto this important message without being over-the-top eco-fashion.</p>
<p class="p1">The design and site is always growing and adapting, but we have not had to do a full redesign as the BigCommerce platform allows us to make changes quickly and easily and that helps us keep moving forward.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Our new design came about because of a need for an updated look to modern web trends. A responsive design was needed, as well as a clean and streamlined feel. We worked with Nicholas Kosanovich at Striking Alchemy who has been working with BigCommerce for quite some time. He also designed our second layout for this site (the current layout is the third). With a good portion of our customers being from mobile devices, I feel that conversions have gone up a decent amount.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;My site design came about as a result of wanting a website that had a more minimalistic look. I was more concerned with offering my customers a high-quality product photo that told the story of the items that they were going to buy. Everything else was something that I wanted to compliment the product listings with. The design is inspired by a more clean looking and simpler concept.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve seen an increase in overall traffic and sales. My customers constantly compliment my website design. I&#8217;ve seen my conversion rates go from 1.5% on average to about 2.5-3% on average. So I am very happy overall!&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;As we were developing the concept for Gitli Goods, it became very clear that we would launch as an ecommerce business only. That meant that the website and our ecommerce solution needed to be outstanding. My background is in retail merchandising and store design, so I wanted to make sure that the site clearly conveyed the brand message and was easy for customers to navigate. I spent a lot of time shopping other online retailers, throughout various markets, and made a list of what I felt were important attributes to the type of site that I wanted for Gitli Goods.</p>
<p class="p1">We worked with and continue to work with 3 Seed Marketing, Design and Interactive. They used a BigCommerce theme that we chose for the starting point and customized what they needed to as they built out the site.</p>
<p class="p1">This is our first ecommerce web design project and I am very happy with what we have developed. The store has been live for a little over two years now and we see consistent traffic from new and repeat visitors daily and sales are continuing to grow.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Our objective when designing the Green Glass Company website was to provide consumers with a great shopping experience. We want them to quickly understand what is unique about the product – glassware made from the top and bottom of re-purposed bottles – and to be able to easily browse through the entire product line. We really thought about the potential mindset of consumers as they entered the site and tried to answer their questions along their visit. Some come in to shop for a gift, some look for certain colors to match their tableware, some to procrastinate.</p>
<p class="p1">We also looked at the site as a branded display: the color, font and images chosen are aligned to everything we do under the Green Glass brand and developed to visually augment the design of our products. The background is very neutral so that the eye focuses on the product instead. Despite the &#8216;Green;&#8217; in our name and the environmental mission of the company, we do not use a lot of green on the site because it can clash easily with our forest and evergreen collections.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;<span class="s1">Our site design actually came about after viewing competitors sites that seemed cluttered and confusing. Our target audience is the college-aged sorority girl and we know that they have a million things going on at one time. Creating a site that is visually overwhelming, confusing and packed full of too much information was a turn off to me and I know could have the same effect on our customer. We have only a small amount of time to engage our customer to the point of making a purchase, so our first impression had to grab them. Additionally, our products are so highly customizable, we had to create a look and feel that was as streamlined and clean as possible &#8212; to make navigating the customization process of apparel as straightforward and easy as possible. We took inspiration from companies that were popular with our demographic, offered a site that was pleasing to the eye, and were easy to navigate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our sales were so greatly increased that we actually faced some pretty significant growing pains due to not having the adequate space and employees to handle our incredible growth. It forced us to break our lease and move to a space three times as big, as well as increase our workforce. We feel confident, since we are solely an internet-based business, that it is directly related to our new design. Our customers enjoy their shopping experience and even customers new to the world of sorority apparel find that navigating the design process is made easy and self explanatory thanks to the proprietary modules we have created to help with the process.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;We were looking to update our website design and wanted to incorporate more imagery and graphics. The theme we selected allows us to showcase our products, athletes and partners in a unique manner that sets us apart in our industry. We were looking to incorporate lifestyle images that connected water polo players with the highest level athletes. Because we are the Competitive Gear Sponsor for the 2016 USA Men&#8217;s and Women&#8217;s Olympic Team, we are able to really dive into connecting those athletes with the individual athlete. Our goal is always to come full circle in creating and developing opportunities for young water polo athletes to achieve their goal to someday reach the national level.</p>
<p class="p1">This is our second redesign and we have gotten nothing but positive feedback from our customers. The upgrade has not gone unnoticed –– from the look and feel of the website, to the ease of exploring, shopping and checking out. The new theme has really given us an opportunity to allow our customer base to interact with the website and products more than we were able to in the past.</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;We wanted our site to be as clean, striking and easy to navigate as possible. The idea that we kept coming back to is that of a dashboard. Our customers are busy women who don&#8217;t have a ton of time to shop. We wanted to make it really easy for them to access everything they need, whether it&#8217;s to find a dress or to contact customer service.</p>
<p class="p1">We also looked a lot at posted design from the 1930s-1960s, which tended to a very angular, geometric vibe while also staying very graphically crisp. That frequently meant shapes overlaid on large swaths of white background, which we gravitated toward.</p>
<p class="p1">We worked with Atelier Cho Thompson to create both our logo and the framework for our homepage. I cannot recommend them highly enough. It was 100% their idea to connect what we verbalized about our brand – strong, clear, customer-friendly – to a graphic theme that felt just right for us. We also worked with Sitetech Media to adapt a BigCommerce theme into Atelier Cho Thompson&#8217;s custom web design. Just as I said before, I cannot recommend them highly enough – not only are they incredibly adept at BigCommerce, they are really easy to work with.</p>
<p class="p1">I should note that both teams were led by women. It was really important to us that everyone working on the site reflect our audience.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;We took our inspiration from our own personalities and our geographic local. We wanted something that reflected the urban life and image we live and sell to. At the same time, an ecommerce site needs to be functional and easy to navigate, giving your customers plenty of access and opportunities to buy.</p>
<p class="p1">Originally, we saw that our customers had some issues with product selection and getting to what they wanted efficiently. So we worked with the developer to streamline the shopping process and clarify choices, all the while incorporating our brand style.  It&#8217;s always a blend of function and style for us. Doing this enabled us to improve our conversion rate and increase our sales averages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are a custom gaming controller company and really wanted a well branded, bright and feature-packed site that was simple to navigate so that our custom controllers can be showcased well along with being easy to customize and purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Like most websites starting out, we have had a few templates over the years just trying to find what we were looking for. This included special modifications by developers. Unfortunately it&#8217;s hard to find a developer that&#8217;s going to understand the ideas you have without knowing your industry (especially in a niche market) and without having a huge budget. After we took the job on ourselves, we have seen a growth in sales and even positive feedback from our customers about the design. Your website is your store front and if it&#8217;s overwhelming or not very inviting, you may lose business.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Growing up in the Deep South, I’ve had a lifetime passion for American craftsmanship. Just before designing and launching the website, I met a master woodturner. Seeing the beautiful workmanship in his bowls and the artistic photography of his workshop, and hearing the passion in his voice as he talked about his trade &#8212; it made me realize how committed he is to teaching younger generations. It all took me back to spending time with my dad in his workshop, listening to him tell stories and being fascinated with the fact that he could make anything.</p>
<p>That was my &#8216;aha&#8217; moment as to how the website should look, sound and feel – like you are 1:1 with a master craftsman in his workshop, watching him work and listening to his engaging storytelling, with a touch of nostalgia. We wanted our site to be a reminder of the &#8216;good ole’ days&#8217; when more people were self-sufficient.</p>
<p>To give the consumer that rich experience, we went with a website with a neutral and home-y palette that really showcases the amazing talent of the makers and honors their brands. Our website has videos to give shoppers an inside peak into the makers workshops (including the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU00guwzlOc">master woodturner</a> who was my inspiration), blogs giving an in-depth look at the makers’ lives and beautiful photography showcasing their work and processes.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Basically we had two designs and it was hard to separate them. So in the end, we melded them both together. We think it looks modern, easy on the eye and easy to navigate to what people want.</p>
<p class="p1">About one year ago, we changed the look. Together with partner Clever Local helping with the new site design and backend structure, and a search engine optimization strategy and Adwords campaigns, it all has made a big difference to our turnover.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a redesign, we had an earlier theme that worked well and was customized, but I really needed to update it. This is a part-time endeavor for my company, so it continues to be a work in progress, and a significant amount of work still needs to be done. But, since the design change, I have noticed some differences just now starting to happen. Average order value has slightly increased, and we are now starting to get more calls from our customers on other sales channels (eBay/Amazon) that have found us online. I’ve been happy with the slow but steady progress!&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;<span class="s1">I come from a family of artists, so it is safe to say I have an eye for color. When I started my design process, I wanted to evoke an overall feeling of calm and peace, therefore I choose this color blue. Next, the logo came about after doodling many months on paper. I wanted the shape to represent the product. Then a name – the nod in Nodpod is to represent sleep, and then pod to represent the shape of the eye mask, as it looks like a pea pod. Once I had my logo, name and color decided upon, I could visualize the design of the website. </span></p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;We’ve always been big fans of stripped-back, minimal design and know that most of the big fashion/lifestyle sites opt for this approach. We did, however, know that as a small company we needed to inject some personality into the design and we hope that’s come across! It’s an ever-evolving process as we’re constantly inspired by the things we see and the amazing creative people we meet.</p>
<p class="p1">Luckily one half of the Sneaky Peek team is a designer/developer so we had that covered from the start. It definitely helped keep the costs down and allows us to make changes easily along the way. We’re able to make changes as often as we like, but the current version is probably our second proper design. The redesign coincided with a social media push, so we definitely saw a rise in traffic and engagement, but the main thing was we felt a lot happier with the design so were more confident in shouting about the brand, which in turn helped across the board.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Being a creative business owner, illustrator and graphic designer, it was important to me that I did the majority of the design work with the site. Having continuity between the products and the website, was top priority. It was important that the site was easy to use, full of bright photos and inspirational ideas. I used elements from my product line in the design of the site, lending to an overall consistent &#8216;look&#8217; between the site and the products. When someone loves the site, they&#8217;ll be drawn to the products.</p>
<p class="p1">Spring of 2015 we redesigned the website. We customized nearly the entire website, and we brightened the site with bigger photos and easier to navigate pages. We&#8217;ve noticed a drastic change in our sales and our site traffic, doubling our revenue, tripling our conversion rates and seeing our average order rate increase of 30%.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;We designed Toy Fiesta’s website to represent our business with relevance and to reflect its core values. At the same time, we designed it to look playful, simple and user friendly. Our products are all about fun education and skill building. This is clearly reflected in the logo, where the young girl is happily enjoying a celebration moment with a blackboard in the back ground. Confirming the same gesture, the black background was also added to the footer.</p>
<p class="p1">Being from Australia and with the cultural diversity we enjoy here, we added the boys to the footer. Both busy learning through play, with a reflection on cooperation and mutual respect is another cornerstone [we believe] builds a strong society.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;<span class="s1">The site design was inspired by other great and leading sites on the internet in the screen protection business. Being fairly new (few years) in the market, it was best to research ideas and combine great design features from the leading great sites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a redesign. The first design was originally a theme that was not responsive and too basic. Because we also have a marketing company which does all of our SEO, social marketing, content marketing and blogs, conversions are slowly going up. A great design also helps in ROI.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;Our site is primarily focused on the survival industry, but just because it is survival based doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be &#8216;doom and gloom.&#8217; Our primary objective was to create a look and feel that was encouraging and positive with a focus on the outdoors. Our second objective was to ensure that our design didn&#8217;t exclude outdoor enthusiasts, as our secondary market is the outdoor market (campers, hikers, hunters, fisherman, etc.).</p>
<p class="p1">Since relaunching, our traffic is up by 300% in the first six months utilizing the same marketing budget. Our conversion rate is up 541% in the first six months vs. the last six months using the Magento platform. Our average number of page views by visitor is also up 220%.</p>
<p class="p1">During the past six months, we&#8217;ve made a few minor adjustments to product displays and pages and I&#8217;m happy to say our small company has been able to do these ourselves and not have to pay an outside company to make these adjustments. I can&#8217;t express how happy we are since switching platforms [and redesigning].&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;<span class="s1">Our ecommerce design was inspired partly from our old website. We wanted to keep our look and feel but step it up a bit and make it more modern, responsive and have a better flow, all while keeping it simple. That’s why we chose the Minimal template. It was easy to work with and it kept our site simple.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was a redesign and the second version of our website. Our site traffic has doubled from our old platform –– when we redesigned the site –– as well as our sales. Our average order is bit harder to figure out because we also process all of our wholesale accounts through BigCommerce. But, our sales have have almost tripled this year from what they were last year at this point. Overall, our conversion rate has increased too, although we need to work more on marketing to help that out.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;<span class="s1">The inspiration of the design came about while shopping at several fashion boutiques in Los Angeles, California. There was one fashion boutique that really caught my eye that used bright white lighting and hot pink as a contrast to attract attention and provide a bright, energetic and youthful feel while shopping. We wanted to bring that feeling online to the world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This redesign has decreased our bounce rate by 23% and converted abandoned carts due to BigCommerce features like the abandoned cart emails. The main difference that we could see with the new design was that we had tripled our statistics on customer re-orders for their second order and also nearly doubled our stats for customers who have placed orders more than three times.&#8221;</span></p>

<h1 class="p1">Ecommerce Design Advice from Industry Experts</h1>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Today, it is a must for any ecommerce site to be mobile friendly. There are quite a few reports that state that over 50% of ecommerce traffic is from mobile. And with the usage of mobile devices on the rise, there&#8217;s little doubt that this traffic will continue to increase. In order to get the most out of your website visitors, your design should be created with mobile users in mind in order to capitalize on this traffic source.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;When it comes to conversion, content and flow and design all play an important role in boosting the conversion rate. So, using the right colors and elements can help increase the conversion rate.</p>
<p>A page should also create a better user engagement, otherwise users click away which increases bounce rate and as a result lowers ranking in search engines.&#8221;</p>

<div>Driving commerce in the modern mobile, social era means we have to create experiences, not landing pages. That means a sequence of touches over time, not a single snapshot of a home page or a shopping cart.</div>
<p>Ironically, the brands that are driving the best sales are doing it not through better technology or <span class="il">design</span>, necessarily, but by having the care of their customers translate to building relationships over time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When it comes to ecommerce systems, so many companies fail because they have not fully validated their ideas, market and products prior to deploying a sales system. It is so important to interview potential buyers, understand their needs and price points for products prior to spending time on a sales system. Once you know what makes a customer tick, you will know what metrics to track and what methods will be effective in creating conversions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The internet provides such a great opportunity for anyone to sell their products and services to anyone, anywhere in the world. But because anyone can do it, the competition is intense. To be successful, a website needs to hit on all cylinders –– optimized for search, mobile friendly, look beautiful, easy to navigate, easy to buy, easy to manage. Misfire on any of these and customers will disconnect from you and connect with a competitor.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">&#8220;In ecommerce design, clarity always beats cleverness. Following too many design trends can actually hurt you. Instead, first focus on flawlessly implementing commonly understood UI patterns.

An easily understood design builds instant trust, which always improves conversion.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">Shaping light is a vital photography skill. I say “shape” for a reason: improving lighting doesn’t simply mean adding more wattage. It means selecting the right equipment and positioning for your product, budget and studio space.</p>
<p class="p1">When you’re deciding where to invest your dollars in product photography, first ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What am I shooting?</li>
<li class="p1">Where am I shooting?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Your needs will be different if you’re exclusively shooting still products in studio versus apparel on models in motion outdoors.</p>
<p class="p1">The answers to your “what” and “where” questions will determine:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Whether you need battery packs or AC power</li>
<li class="p1">What type of recycling time you need</li>
<li class="p1">If remote triggering is necessary</li>
<li class="p1">The importance of portability</li>
<li class="p1">How you handle safety concerns.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Keep those specifics in mind as we break down broader divisions.</p>
<h3 class="p3">What are the three main types of photography lights?</h3>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Continuous</li>
<li class="p1">Speedlight</li>
<li class="p1">Strobe monolight</li>
</ol>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Looking for a Place to Purchase Your Lights?</h3></p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://precision-camera.com">Precision Camera</a> located in Austin, Texas. It is the largest camera store between New York and LA.</p>
<p></div>
<h2 class="p4">Continuous Lighting</h2>
<p class="p1">Continuous lighting works the way it sounds: your light stays on, continuously, as opposed to the powerful pulses of strobe speedlights and monolights.</p>
<p class="p1">Continuous lighting is not as powerful as strobe lighting, but it’s good for beginners because what you see is what you get. That makes it much easier to adjust lighting as necessary, and it’s also generally cheaper.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s most useful for still photography and video, which suits product photography well. You may also choose to use it with models for eye comfort.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_continuous.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16512" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_continuous.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_continuous.jpg 360w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_continuous-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_continuous-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Continuous lighting kits are good for beginners.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Continuous lighting is good for beginners because you can see how light will affect your image before shooting, which makes adjustments easier. It’s also cost-effective compared to other lighting kits.</p>
<p class="p1">There are three primary types of continuous lighting bulbs:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Fluorescent</li>
<li class="p1">Tungsten</li>
<li class="p1">LED</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">The choice between bulb types is mostly a matter of personal preference, as each has pros and cons.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Tungsten bulbs</strong> emit the most light in the broadest spectrum, but they also emit an uncomfortable or even dangerous amount of heat and use the most power.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>LED bulbs</strong> are easy and fast to set up, but because they’re newer there aren’t as many accessories available.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Fluorescent </strong>tends to be the most common bulb in use in studio lighting; they’re safer and more energy efficient than tungsten, they have lots of modifiers like softboxes available, and there’s no need for the portability of LED.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Whatever bulb you select, set your camera’s white balance accordingly and use a grey card to ensure your colors are captured as accurately as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s a wide price range when it comes to lighting equipment for product photography. Here are good options for continuous lighting kits at a variety of price points:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">$85 <a href="https://www.adorama.com/fpssbk2.html">Flashpoint</a> 2-Light Fluorescent Kit</li>
<li class="p1">$105 <a href="http://www.adorama.com/SVIMLTK.html">Smith Victor</a> Imagemaker Fluorescent Tent Kit</li>
<li class="p1">$180 <a href="http://www.adorama.com/BOLED95DK2.html?gclid=CjkKEQjw5qmdBRCn--70gPSo074BEiQAJCe7zVOiGlGxGC9xQ6D08JB626EgEiX8IGA2PxhiAnw_Cw3w_wcB">Bescor LED</a>– 95DK2 Light Kit</li>
<li class="p1">$385 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interfit-INT188-Stellar-Tungsten-Softbox/dp/B0024NKGSC">Interfit Stellar</a> INT188 Tungsten Double Softbox Kit</li>
<li class="p1">$400 <a href="http://www.adorama.com/FPVL500CK.html?gclid=CjkKEQjw5qmdBRCn--70gPSo074BEiQAJCe7zbSEUvyaP83MJtZS69BRH_OXnrzTOoRWCuyHN8h54IXw_wcB">Flashpoint 500 LED</a> Video 2-Light Kit</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can give yourself even more control over your light if you look for adjustable power options.</p>
<p class="p1">Variable power may save you time and help you take better photographs by letting you adjust your light more subtly and quickly than removing bulbs. Some multi-socket kits will let you toggle select bulbs on and off to control your power.</p>

<p class="p1">Continuous lighting has its uses, like for beginners and video as we’ve discussed, but they are not as popular as strobe lighting options.</p>
<p class="p1">Strobes simply produce more power, and they pack it all into a very brief moment of time, allowing you to overpower other light sources (like the sun) and completely control your light.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s take a look at two types of strobe lighting:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Speedlights</li>
<li class="p1">Monolights</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="p4">Speedlight Lighting</h2>
<p class="p1">Speedlights (or “speedlite”) are external flash units also known as an “on-camera flash.” Despite the name, they don’t have to be attached to your camera (although they often are).</p>
<p class="p1">Because speedlights are strobes, they produce an immense amount of light in an instant and then need several seconds to recycle before firing again.</p>
<p class="p1">That can be frustrating for beginners, who may have several false starts before getting the lighting just right.</p>
<p class="p1">For confident photographers, or photographers on the go, the power and flexibility of speedlights is well worth the wait. The increased light allows more varied aperture and ISO settings in a wider variety of environments.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_speedlight.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16514" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_speedlight.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_speedlight.jpg 360w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_speedlight-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_speedlight-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Speedlights, also known as on-camera flashes, are highly portable and versatile. Img src: <a href="http://cdn-4.nikon-cdn.com/e/Q5NM96RZZo-aQIVEfvQ997L3sEHoBd-VCJRKp0azfIGIA2qjHVulZXiEO1kIf-SI/Views/4808_SB-700-AF-Speedlight-front.png">nikonusa.com</a></em></p>
<p class="p1">Speedlights are faster and more powerful than your camera’s built-in flash, and they can be used with umbrellas and softboxes to create dispersed light. They’re lightweight, portable and lend themselves well to action shots and location photography.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’re taking the speedlight approach, you’ll need to purchase both a speedlight and an accessories kit.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are two great speedlight flash options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">$225 <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/855106-REG/bolt_vx_710n_on_camera_flash.html">Bolt Flash</a> for Nikon cameras</li>
<li class="p1">$270 <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/860418-REG/bolt_vx_760c_on_camera_flash.html">Bolt Flash</a> for Canon cameras</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can fire flashes from your camera or remotely, which leads into the next step of assembling your speedlight kit.</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4808_SB-700-AF-Speedlight-front.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16509" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4808_SB-700-AF-Speedlight-front.png" alt="" width="640" height="544" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4808_SB-700-AF-Speedlight-front.png 700w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4808_SB-700-AF-Speedlight-front-300x255.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>You can buy light stands and softboxes without lamps to use with your speedlight.</em></p>
<p class="p1">You need umbrellas, reflectors, and stands to complete your lighting kit. Here are two options at different scales:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">$150 <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/820999-REG/Westcott_2340_36_Apollo_Orb_Speedlite.html">Westcott</a> Speedlite Kit (one softbox, stand, shoe mount)</li>
<li class="p1">$500 <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1024607-REG/photoflex_sb_ptslkt_photoflex_portable_speedlite_kit.html">Photoflex</a> Speedlite Kit (two softboxes, stands, speed rings, shoe mounts, bag)</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p4">Monolight Strobe Lighting</h2>
<p class="p1">Monolights are self-contained strobe units with a power supply, cooling fans, reflectors and stands. They’re sometimes also called “monoblocks.”</p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_mono.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16513" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_mono.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_mono.jpg 360w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_mono-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/lighting-kits_mono-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a></em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Monolights are tidy self-contained units with their own power supply and more.</em></p>
<p class="p1">The primary advantage of a monolight is that the head of the lamp contains its own power source, so you don’t need an additional generator or power pack.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s tidier, allows more positional flexibility and eliminates extension cables preventing power loss (estimated at about a ¼-stop of light each time you connect cable components).</p>
<p class="p1">Monolights are studio favorites, but they can be used for location photography as many of them are quite compact. It’s helpful not to be dependent on a single power pack, so that if one light’s power supply is blown any others will still be operable.</p>
<p class="p1">Strobe monolights are popular for model photography and product photography. They also usually come with a continuous lighting setting.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a few good strobe monolight options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">$450 <a href="http://www.adorama.com/WESTL2LK.html">Westcott</a> 240 Strobelite Two Monolight Kit</li>
<li class="p1">$715 <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1303958-REG/https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1303958-REG/angler_q400_2_monolight_kit_with.html.html">Angler</a> Q400 Two Monolight Kit</li>
<li class="p1">$900 <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/897972-REG/Bowens_bw_4765txus_Gemini_400Rx_Twin_Head.html">Bowens</a> Gemini Two Monolight Kit</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Whatever type of lighting kit you invest in, we recommend getting at least two sources to ensure you have ample light. The added versatility will allow you to be more creative and professional.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Pros and Cons of Each Lighting Method</h2>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pros-cons-lights-ecommerce-photography.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21063" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pros-cons-lights-ecommerce-photography.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="960" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pros-cons-lights-ecommerce-photography.jpg 650w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pros-cons-lights-ecommerce-photography-300x450.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p4">Next Steps</h2>
<p class="p1">Lighting is product specific: you’ll use a different arrangement for metallic objects than you will for apparel.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you have your equipment, you need to know <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-rock-product-photography-on-a-budget/">how to use it</a>. With lighting, that largely means positioning.</p>
<p class="p1">Take <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/product-photography-reflective-products/">reflective products</a> as an example: you might backlight clear or colored glass, while you sidelight detailed glass, and overhead light metal objects, but we’ll cover this more in depth in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p class="p1">Key additions include eight long-awaited theme variations (Exhibit and Runway) which feature a sidebar navigation, in addition to four additional theme variations (Hero) designed for larger catalog sizes. Here’s a top-level view of the new additions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Exhibit:</strong> Key benefits include sidebar navigation and featured content slots including multi-level categories, brands or pages.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Runway:</strong> Key benefits include sidebar navigation and support for full-width images designed to invite customer engagement.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Hero:</strong> Key benefits include a traditional drop down or a ‘mega menu’ capable of supporting very large catalogs.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Atelier:</strong> Key benefits include high-quality editorial aesthetic, unique navigation and stunning homepage product grid.</li>
</ul>
