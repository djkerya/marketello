<p class="p1">The retail space is competitive and ever-changing. No one wants to be held to a 12-month launch timeline costing half a million dollars or more for an ecommerce campaign, B2C site or employee site.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why dozens of enterprise brands at the leading edge of technology are choosing SaaS –– specifically, BigCommerce –– to power new ecommerce initiatives and stay competitive in a quick-to-innovate market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing a trend with large brands leveraging SaaS ecommerce platforms to design shopping experiences in a fraction of the time and cost as legacy systems without compromising requirements.</p>
<p class="p1">These shopping experiences vary from creating unique direct to consumer shopping channels on social media to custom purchasing portals that serve a B2B customer segment. This is all representing a shift in approach, &#8216;Agile Commerce&#8217;, that brands are taking in order to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re excited because the BigCommerce Enterprise platform is uniquely positioned to support large brands&#8217; unique challenges of being agile while meeting enterprise requirements of performance, security and flexibility at scale.&#8221; –– Daniel Townsend, Founding Partner, <a href="http://www.plumtreegroup.net/">The Plum Tree Group</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Here are the top 7 ways enterprise brands are getting SaaS on their approved vendor list to increase campaign revenue, sell additional inventory and launch brand innovation initiatives on time and under budget.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Direct-to-Consumer Deployments</h2>
<p class="p1">Legacy B2B and wholesale brands are needing to launch additional B2C channels to harness consumer fanfare around their product.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/b2b-ecommerce/">With B2B still priority for the business</a>, these B2C sites must be cost-effective, meet modern UX standards and pass procurement’s strict requirements for stability and security.</p>
<p class="p1">See how these 8 enterprise brands make this work.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Streamlined B2B Ecommerce</h2>
<p class="p1">As the new generation of buyers ages into management positions, more and more B2B customers are wanting to buy online –– and expecting the same B2C UX experience they get elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p1">This market <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/B2B-Ecommerce-Market-Still-Maturing/1014311">is expected to account for</a> $6.7 trillion by 2020 –– 27% of all B2B sales.</p>
<p class="p1">For Koch Industries’ Georgia Pacific brands, BigCommerce is the solution of choice for a portal-restricted site that allows fast and convenient B2B purchasing of their Bleached Board cardboard.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21350" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/georgia-pacific.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/georgia-pacific.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/georgia-pacific-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/georgia-pacific-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 class="p3">Franchise Stores</h2>
<p class="p1">Delaware North is one of the U.S.’s largest umbrella brands. Headquartered in Buffalo, the company operates in the lodging, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/sports-outdoors/">sporting</a>, airport, gaming and entertainment industries, employing more than 55,000 people worldwide and generating over $2.6 billion in annual revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">Each of Delaware North’s individual brands operates as a franchise establishment, with local management and brand rules. However, top-flight technology spans their catalog. Multiple of Delaware North’s franchise operations –– including the Carolina Panthers and the Grand Canyon’s merchandise store –– use BigCommerce to power their fan sites and drive additional online revenue from loyal consumers.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Carolina Panthers</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-21351" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carolina-panthers-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carolina-panthers-1.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carolina-panthers-1-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carolina-panthers-1-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3 class="p4">Grand Canyon Store</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-21352" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shop-grand-canyon.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shop-grand-canyon.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shop-grand-canyon-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shop-grand-canyon-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 class="p3">Upselling and Reselling</h2>
<p class="p1">Assurant and T-Mobile’s device upgrade partnership allows T-Mobile customers to send in their old devices. Those devices end up in an Assurant warehouse.</p>
<p class="p1">When the old phones began taking up too much space, the Assurant team decided to offer the phones to employees at customized prices –– launching a B2E site on BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p1">Three months in, the employee store was so successful, Assurant launched the reselling site to the public and wholesalers as an additional revenue channel pulling in both B2C and B2B revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">Their BigCommerce website utilizes <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Setting-up-Customer-Groups">built-in Customer Groups</a> to allow three audience segments to purchase from one website.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Assurant’s MyWit Brand</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-21353" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/my-wit.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/my-wit.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/my-wit-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/my-wit-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 class="p3">B2E + Internal Collateral Self-Service</h2>
<p class="p1">Cargill uses BigCommerce to manage marketing collateral via downloads, as well as requesting collateral creation for various business units. The company uses SSO/SAML to authenticate users with SailPoint. That way, if an employee is no longer with the company or if a random user tries to login, they will be blocked.</p>
<p class="p1">Other B2E use cases we see across brands like DuPont and Sony are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Employee uniform online stores or items employees are required to purchase for the job.</li>
<li class="p1">Selling product at cost to employees, or offering them special product for being an employee.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p4">Cargill</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cargill.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21354" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cargill.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cargill.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cargill-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cargill-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4">Sony</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sony.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21355" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sony.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sony.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sony-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sony-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">Education and Publishing Vertical</h2>
<p class="p1">Ecommerce has disrupted the business model of every industry –– and education is no different. This is why universities and traditional textbook suppliers like Harvard and Nelson Education have partnered with BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p1">Harvard is launching a direct to consumer site to sell educational material to the public –– helping to spread the power of knowledge far beyond Cambridge.</p>
<p class="p1">Nelson Education is taking this idea even further. With BigCommerce (and partner <a href="https://beapartof.com/">Be a Part Of</a>), the brand is launching both a direct to consumer site for students, as well as a B2B site for schools to purchase bulk orders on a regular basis –– <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Setting-up-Customer-Groups">using built-in customer groups</a> to pre-populate negotiated prices and a quoting tool for quotes on the spot, no phone call required.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Nelson Education</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-21356" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nelson-education.png" alt="" width="640" height="312" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nelson-education.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nelson-education-300x146.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nelson-education-750x366.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 class="p3">The Power to Innovate</h2>
<p class="p1">Are you wanting to take your business to the next level with an innovative solution or campaign? Geo-targeted roll outs are common for enterprise brands to test out demand and feasibility before expanding to larger markets.</p>
<p class="p1">Philip Morris uses the BigCommerce platform for invite-only access to the company’s new cigarette delivery service in Australia. Philip Morris is <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38152297">already making headlines</a> in the UK for eliminating the conventional cigarette and removing them from convenient stores thanks to immediate delivery.</p>
<p class="p1">In V2, they will be rolling out API integrations with BigCommerce to become the UberEats of cigarettes.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21357" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/philip-morris.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/philip-morris.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/philip-morris-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/philip-morris-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">The move to SaaS has only begun. As SaaS platforms like BigCommerce continue to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/man-crates-ecommerce-api-integrations/">innovate and open APIs</a>, enterprise brands can shift resources from tech debt to marketing and advertising spend, which increase sales and boost the bottom line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;BigCommerce Enterprise has allowed our agency to address the myriad needs of large ecommerce brands and enterprise businesses. BigCommerce&#8217;s offering allows us to quickly plan and implement unique shopping and content experiences for a wide range of customer groups and product types, without sacrificing finance, logistics, or operations requirements.</p>
<p class="p1">With BigCommerce Enterprise&#8217;s best in class hosting, security, support, and an exceptional product development team, we&#8217;re enabled to better service our enterprise clients than with other SaaS ecommerce solutions.&#8221; –– Jordan Brannon, Director of Digital Strategy, <a href="https://coalitiontechnologies.com/">Coalition Technologies</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">It’s a new era –– and we’re incredibly excited to be a part of it.</p>

I was convinced I could run a business while traveling, making U.S. dollars and spending Argentinian pesos, while chatting over Skype with a supplier in China, coffee in my hand and tea in theirs.</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted this to work. I selected a few products and hired expensive web developers to build me a site. All that ever came of it was a few ugly pages and an endless amount of 404s before I ran out of money.</p>
<p class="p1">My plans for an endless vacation failed miserably, and quickly, as did 6 other ideas I had had prior. I decided to go back to college and abandon my dream.</p>

<p class="p1">My plans for an endless vacation failed miserably, and quickly, as did 6 other ideas I had had prior. I decided to go back to college and abandon my dream.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">You’d think maybe I wasn’t a good businessman, but youth was on my side. And, as it turns out, so was technology.</p>
<p class="p1">I started my current business, <a href="https://www.flexfireleds.com/">Flexfire LEDs</a>, in 2010. I was a junior in college at the time and refused to give up on what I knew was possible. I could see that LEDs were the future of the way we light our planet, and I wanted to be a part of it.</p>
<p class="p1">Prior to 2010, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-start-online-business/">starting an online business</a> was near impossible. Trust me. I tried.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">It took knowing how to code to build the site.</li>
<li class="p1">It took having the right connections to get yourself a single product.</li>
<li class="p1">It took earning trust –– not to mention traffic –– just to get a sale.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Some of those things are still very true.</p>
<p class="p1">You still need to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-drive-traffic-convert-customers/">earn trust and drive traffic</a>. But you don’t have to know how to code anymore to build yourself a site. Nor do you necessarily need connections in the industry to get yourself some great products.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Widespread internet usage solves for the latter</strong> –– where you can Google suppliers and build relationships.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>And technology like BigCommerce solves for the former</strong> –– where you can build a site and customize it without touching a single piece of code.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The only problem left to solve is the need to drive traffic and trust. And on this, I have become an expert.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The Business of B2B</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Our customer base is split 50/50 for homeowners (regular consumers) and businesses (B2B). And yet, only 20% of our revenue comes from our B2C segment.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Today, Flexfire LEDs drives more than $5M in annual sales. Our customer base is split 50/50 for homeowners (regular consumers) and businesses (B2B). And yet, only 20% of our revenue comes from our B2C segment.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s because businesses buying from other businesses buy in bulk –– and they buy often. Their large, regular orders drive the majority of our business. And, we partner with the best in the industry:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Kohler</li>
<li class="p1">Boeing</li>
<li class="p1">Disney</li>
<li class="p1">Marriott</li>
<li class="p1">Google</li>
<li class="p1">Apple</li>
<li class="p1">Bellagio</li>
<li class="p1">Embassy Suites</li>
<li class="p1">Ford Motors</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The list goes on.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, of course, earning customers like that and hitting a multi-million dollar revenue mark didn’t happen overnight.</p>
<p class="p1">But it did happen between 2013 and 2015 –– when our business was growing 832%.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>BigCommerce's B2B Power</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Flexfire LEDs isn&#8217;t the only B2B company using BigCommerce to skyrocket growth. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/atlanta-light-bulbs/">Read more about how Atlanta Light Bulbs uses the platform to scale their B2B business faster than ever before</a>.</p>

<h2 class="p3">How to Earn a 832% Increase in Revenue</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Little did we know, we were following Google’s “best marketing practices for 2017” book back in 2010. Each Google update in the subsequent years shot our rankings up and our competition down.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">In 2013, Google released Hummingbird, the single largest change to Google’s search algorithm in 12 years.</p>
<p class="p2">This wasn’t an update like Panda or Penguin. This was a completely new algorithm –– this time, focused on conversational and semantic search. The goal was to deliver more accurate search results –– as any Google algorithm update always is.</p>
<p class="p1">But in 2013, it was incredibly needed because the results Google kept showing weren’t any good at all.</p>
<p class="p2">And that’s because back in 2010 and 2011, SEO techniques were pretty much centered around this thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Trick Google into ranking you higher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Everyone was doing it. That was back when there were link farms and content companies that would write junk keyword-stuffed articles in less than 500 words. The content wasn’t good, needless to say.</p>
<p class="p1">We went a different route.</p>
<p class="p1">I like to think of Google as an all-powerful librarian.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">What would the librarian want to see to recommend the best book to the person asking for it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">That is always how I’ve approached content and Google –– and in 2013, it paid off.</p>
<p class="p1">Big time.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s because we started creating content in 2010 that answered the questions we had ourselves when first researching LED strip lights and how to install them.</p>
<p class="p1">We didn&#8217;t focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Link building strategies</li>
<li class="p1">Spamming forums with linkbacks</li>
<li class="p1">Creating 500 word keyword stuffed blogs on non-relevant websites</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">We focused on:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Education</li>
<li class="p1">Customer experience</li>
<li class="p1">Adding value</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Little did we know, we were following Google’s “best marketing practices for 2017” book back in 2010. Each Google update in the subsequent years shot our rankings up and our competition down.</p>
<p class="p1">Organic traffic has always been our biggest source of traffic. Our first sale came from <a href="https://www.flexfireleds.com/top-4-considerations-before-buying-flexible-led-strip-lights/">one of our articles</a> explaining the technical difference between two types of LEDs.</p>
<p class="p1">And it is our educational content that builds brand trust and traffic –– even among the industry’s most trusted brands themselves.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The 8 Business Principles to Long Term Success</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I know all too well thanks to my years of entrepreneurial setbacks that to focus on immediate profit meant near immediate failure.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">To stick it out back then, and to follow our gut on what we knew was good content –– but content that didn&#8217;t immediately get the traffic it deserved –– was hard.</p>
<p class="p1">It took dedication and conviction to business principles others were forgoing in the name of immediate profit.</p>
<p class="p1">I knew all too well thanks to my years of entrepreneurial setbacks that to focus on immediate profit meant near immediate failure.</p>
<p class="p1">The principle I stuck with back then was the same as Amazon’s is now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">To be customer-centric, to educate and to add value, to be a source of trusted information, and quality products for when they are ready to actually buy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Some folks out there call this the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/conversion-rate-optimization/">value ladder approach</a>. Others say it is how Amazon hockey-sticked to unparalleled ecommerce dominance.</p>
<p class="p1">For me, it’s about following these 8 principles on a daily basis so my own business will be successful for the long haul.</p>
<p class="p1">These will lead you to success, they have for me.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, it won’t always be easy. You can rest assured, though, that the markets favor those who treat the customer well. These principles will keep you aligned with what is best for them, which is ultimately, if not immediately, what is always best for your bottom line.</p>
<h3 class="p4">1. Always take it one step further<span class="s1"><br />
</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Whenever you think you have gone as far as you can, ask yourself if you can take one step further.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">I call this the OSF (one step further) mentality and it dictates that you always take that additional step for your employees, your customers, and with your products.</p>
<p class="p1">Whenever you think you have gone as far as you can, ask yourself if you can take one step further.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Do things your competitors aren&#8217;t doing</strong>, or do them just a little better. Word travels fast –– especially online.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Do things that your clients don’t expect</strong>. Today, we sent out boxes of girl scout cookies in the orders that went out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Why? Who does that?</p>
<p class="p1">We do! Why not!?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Create a special experience for your customers in your own way</strong>. You are in the business of building a relationship with your customers and your brand. Reviews are VERY IMPORTANT for an online company. Even a few bad ones can be damaging. Take that extra step to make everyone happy, even the problem customers. It will come back around.</p>
<h3 class="p4">2. Focus on content –– really good content.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Write down everything that frustrates you about your industry, competitors, product, and keep adding to that list on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">By focusing on education and a &#8220;one-step-further&#8221; approach to our customer service, Flexfire LEDs was able solve the biggest hurdles in the buying process for our customers and started generating sales the first month of business.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>My advice to you to do the same is</strong>: write down everything that frustrates you about your industry, competitors, product, and keep adding to that list on a daily basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Each one of these notes is a potential game changer in your industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Many trees add up to a forest. Again, OSF!</p>
<p class="p1">If you get the same question more than 5 times from customers writing in, consider writing a nice article educating your customers about it. Better yet, make a video.</p>
<p class="p1">Focus on education and creating a wonderful experience with your customer service. Be the company that you wish was always there for you when something went wrong. Pleasantly surprise your clients.</p>
<h3 class="p4">3. Automate, read, repeat.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Books are like a cheat-sheet to the open note test that is life and business.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Use technology and educate yourself!</p>
<p class="p1">There are hundreds of apps, outsourcing services, and ways to automate processes that are here now that weren&#8217;t a few years ago. Take some time and think the processes through, then automate.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, we use:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/bigcommerce/trello/">Trello</a> for project management</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/bigcommerce/slack/">Slack</a> for communication internally</li>
<li class="p1">All Google apps (gmail, google drive, sheets, docs, etc)</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shipstation/">Shipstation</a> and <a href="https://www.fishbowlcommerce.com/bigcommerce-inventory-software/">Fishbowl</a> for shipping and inventory</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="http://optinmonster.com/docs/how-to-integrate-optinmonster-with-bigcommerce/">OptinMonster</a> for marketing</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/mailchimp/">Mailchimp</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/activecampaign/">Active Campaign</a> for email marketing</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Setting-Up-Google-Analytics">Google Analytics</a></li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/taxjar/">Taxjar</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/avalara/">Avatax</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/quickbooks-online/">Quickbooks</a> for financial</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/stamped-io/">Stamped.io</a> for reviews</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/bigcommerce/">Zapier</a> for easy integration and APIs</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/powr-tools/">Powr.io</a> for form creation</li>
<li class="p1">BigCommerce for our ecommerce hosting</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">I also employ a variety of graphic designers, developers, and admin types through Upwork, and have built out a virtual team to be able to take on additional tasks. Plus, thanks to the virtual, global team, we now have a global market to search from for employment.</p>
<p class="p1">That will give you more time to read.</p>
<p class="p1">You can start with the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357">4 Hour Work Week</a>” and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Less-Doing-Entrepreneurs-Beautiful/dp/1619614421/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495722023&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+doing+less">The Art of Less Doing</a>,” both of which educate you on how to do more, better, and in less time. The answers to many questions you have or will eventually have are already written and available. Read often.</p>

<p class="p1">Books are like a cheat-sheet to the open note test that is life and business.</p>

<p class="p1">Here’s a list of books that have helped me with always maintaining a leadership mindset and have given me instantly effective lessons on how to better run a business.</p>

<h3 class="p4">4. Ask for help and advice.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Whatever hurdle you encounter, someone else has probably solved it before you.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">I bootstrapped the whole company for the first two years. During that time, I outsourced a lot of work and came across a million challenges. The short story is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">I made mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Just about every day I came across a new challenge. My biggest lesson was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Whatever hurdle you encounter, someone else has probably solved it before you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Whenever I was stuck, I would reach out to anyone I think could have the answer. Don’t be afraid to reach out to thought leaders, other CEOs, university professors, or even authors and celebrities if you think they can help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Successful people love to help other people succeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Whenever I would get nervous about asking for help, I would think, “It feels great to offer advice and help others, right? Yeah! Why would I take that opportunity to feel great away from someone else?</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s an actual example of how I started my relationship with one of the most influential mentors I have ever had:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-contact-example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21131" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-contact-example.png" alt="" width="640" height="287" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-contact-example.png 961w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-contact-example-300x135.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/business-principles-contact-example-750x336.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4">5. Start with your vision then work backwards.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Use your imagination to paint a picture of what you want your business to look like in 3 years.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">You cannot choose which path to take if you don’t know where you want to go.</p>
<p class="p1">In the book, “Double Double” by Cameron Herold, the first few chapters are an outline of the most powerful exercise that changed the course of our company.</p>
<p class="p1">I attribute a lot of our success to it and recommend it to all entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s called the Vivid Vision exercise and in short, it calls on you to use your imagination to paint a picture of what you want your business to look like in 3 years.</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine a painting that is composed of every aspect of your life and business 3 years from now. Notice as many details as possible. You’re making money and having fun.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">What do you see?</li>
<li class="p1">Who are your clients?</li>
<li class="p1">How many employees do you have?</li>
<li class="p1">Which magazines are talking about your products?</li>
<li class="p1">Which awards have you won in your industry?</li>
<li class="p1">What do your employees say about your company?</li>
<li class="p1">Are you commuting or teleconferencing?</li>
<li class="p1">What does the desk in your office look like?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Each detail outlined in your picture is a goal. Take that goal and work backward and you will create an actionable plan on how to obtain that goal.</p>
<p class="p1">In my vision, for example, I saw our product installed in airports around the world. I saw that if I created content about airport lighting it would attract the eyes of designers working on airport projects.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, our products are illuminating many major airports around the world!</p>
<p class="p1">Don’t wimp out. Think big!</p>
<h3 class="p4">6. Be insatiably curious.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author">Albert Einstein</div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Curiosity drives research and innovation. Some of Flexfire LEDs’ most successful products came from the curious exploration of unrelated topics.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, an article about a melatonin supplement lead me down a rabbit hole of learning about how light affects circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Blue light can suppress melatonin production in humans. Based on this research we decided to manufacture a strip light with alternating LED chips that allow the user to select a warm, candle-like color white for bedtime, and a cool, daylight colored light for during the active parts of the day. This way your lighting does not disrupt your sleeping patterns.</p>
<p class="p1">The moral of the story is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Starting your own business requires you to learn a lot about a little and a little about a lot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Curiosity and the desire to learn are among the most important qualities I look for in employees because curious people do not back down from mental challenges and don’t give up in the middle of a research task. They’re also more fun to be around in my opinion.</p>
<p class="p1">You are going to be learning a lot about your business. Enjoy the exploration and new knowledge.</p>
<h3 class="p4">7. Know the importance of your team.</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Business is not a zero sum game.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">I love my team. I really do! Even as we grow to more than 25 employees, I can say that everyone on the team is there for a reason, is in the right place, and doing the right things.</p>
<p class="p1">Creating and maintaining an internal culture of free expression, trust, openness, creativity, mentorship, and a burning desire to help our clients may sound too millennial to some, but for us it is <strong>our secret sauce</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1">Notice I am not talking about the importance of hiring the right people, a strict interview process, and building the right team (which is VERY important). I am already assuming you know that.</p>
<p class="p1">When I say the importance of your team, I mean that they are very important to you and you care about them.</p>
<p class="p1">As a business owner I realize that people are spending valuable time on this planet building my dream. I believe in making it their dream, too.</p>
<p class="p1">If your best employee’s life goal is to work in another industry, spend time with him/her and help them to pursue that, even if that means them leaving your company.</p>
<p class="p1">Yes, you heard me right.</p>
<p class="p1">Help them achieve their dreams, just as they are helping you achieve yours. While they are employed by you, they will give it their all, and when they go on to achieve their goals, they would have left your company better for have been there.</p>
<p class="p1">Business is not a zero sum game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Focus on treating your employees right and it will come back to you 10X.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Invest in their health, education, and happiness and you will have loyal and a more creative and harder working staff than all your competitors.</p>
<p class="p1">Most employers believe that happiness is pay related. I believe it is a symptom of doing what you love and being appreciated.</p>
<h3 class="p4">8. Sell a product you are proud of</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">No one wants to be ripped off –– don’t be that company.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Most important, having a quality product is the only way to succeed in business. OK, not the only way, but the only way that will help you win quicker and allow you to sleep at night.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>For me, my story on this starts here:</strong></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">The LED lighting market in 2010 was still getting off the ground, but was finally becoming advanced enough to directly replace other lighting systems at a fraction of the energy usage and at a cost low enough to penetrate the market and disrupt legacy lighting technologies.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">Back then, there were many LED products and markets to choose from with low barriers to entry. The big players had not yet made their move into the market.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">I considered many types of LED products, but came to the realization that, from my garage and with $500, there was no way I could compete in the commercial lighting space once the big players got involved with high investment capabilities, extensive distribution channels, and large sales staff.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">I kept coming across a unique product called an LED strip light. It was a niche product, which meant I could build a company well before the big guys became interested in competing.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">The LED tape light could be cut every inch or so and installed practically anywhere to provide bright, crisp, and beautiful direct or indirect linear lighting almost anywhere imaginable.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">We could only imagine the endless uses and applications from such a cool product!</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">However, I noticed that almost all of the products being produced within our niche were poor quality, were inaccurately representing specifications and output data, and offered almost no education about the product.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">Frustrated, I decided to make the highest quality LED strip light in the world, and focus our company on the best product and education with the customer service I wish I had received all my life.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;">I didn’t care if people used our articles and then purchased somewhere else. I just wanted them to have the correct answers about the product. They eventually come back to us when the other company’s products failed.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">It’s faster to change the industry than wait for the industry to change on its own.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">We didn’t start our company with any seed money from investors. It was just a kitchen table, a garage, a vision, and a curious mind.</p>
<p class="p1">Though we were making sales, things started very slow. I remember when we made $200 in sales in a day, we’d high five, pack it up and go to the beach or go for a hike. We were bootstrapping, so we didn’t need much to keep it going.</p>
<p class="p1">Back then, the lighting industry was (and partly still is) an antiquated offline distribution model that didn’t trust online stores. I mean, we are trying to sell light over the internet, so I understand.</p>
<p class="p1">We relied heavily on (and still do!) our online reviews and customer submitted photos to build trust in our company and products. Word of our product and service traveled fast and we started picking up sales through referrals.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s faster to change the industry than wait for the industry to change on its own.</p>
<p class="p1">And following these principles is what has lead me, my business and my team to industry leader status. We didn’t wait. We acted, we educated, we were honest and we were patient.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, I’m finally able to achieve my 4-hour work week dream. In fact, just this morning, I was on the phone with an employee in China, as they drank tea and I drank coffee.</p>
<p class="p1">In that way, my vision is complete.</p>

<p class="p1">But have you prepared yourself for the possibility of selling the business you have poured your heart and soul into?</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Maybe you need to sell out of necessity for your family?</li>
<li class="p1">Perhaps it grew too fast too soon?</li>
<li class="p1">Or the seller’s market is financially strong and it is simply the perfect time?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In my case, <a href="http://www.sosuzystamps.com/">So Suzy Stamps</a> hit the trifecta jackpot all at once.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">We were facing major family changes</li>
<li class="p1">Our business grew too fast too soon</li>
<li class="p1">The creative industry was booming</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Our reputation was in strong standing and the timeframe we were looking at selling played well into our growth trends.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2 years, we saw a 374% growth, opened a brick and mortar store and our inventory grew to more than I could handle on my own.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-7.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21104" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-7.png" alt="" width="640" height="240" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-7.png 1134w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-7-300x113.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-7-750x282.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We had hit that pivotal moment in our company where we grew too fast.  If I wanted to maintain a high customer satisfaction rate, I needed to make a decision.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Business may have been thriving, but our suppliers and manufacturers could not keep up with the demand and our customers were becoming frustrated.</p>
<p class="p1">We had hit that pivotal moment in our company where we grew too fast.  If I wanted to maintain a high customer satisfaction rate, I needed to make a decision.</p>
<p class="p1">The choices I had before me were simple:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Invest and expand</li>
<li class="p1">Walk away</li>
<li class="p1">Sell</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">My husband and I discussed the possibility of expanding and potentially manufacturing our own stamps, however, the time, money and man-power needed were too great.</p>
<p class="p1">If we went into manufacturing, we would need equipment, a new building, staff, and supplies, not to mention there would be a learning curve as neither of us had manufacturing experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">He wanted to retire, not start a second career.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Walking away was out of the question. I had invested too much time, energy and money into my company to just let it go. Besides, we were thriving.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">I did not become an entrepreneur just to walk away.  This was not a hobby, this was my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The only real option was to sell.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">But where would I go?</li>
<li class="p1">What did I need to do?</li>
<li class="p1">How much was it worth?</li>
<li class="p1">Who could help me with this process?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There were so many questions I needed answers for and not a lot of valuable information available.</p>
<h2 class="p1">6 Questions Every Owner Must Answer Before You Sell</h2>
<p class="p1">Let’s face it, the people writing the traditional selling a business “how to” books and online articles don’t know me, my customers or my industry.</p>
<p class="p1">What works for a real estate developer does not work for a stamp company. I am not making millions of dollars a year, I am a small business owner in the creative industry.</p>
<p class="p1">The most important piece of advice I can give when looking at selling your company is to listen. Listen to you, your customers and your industry.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Why do you want to sell?</strong> Is it out of necessity, continuing growth or are you looking to make a profit?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>What do you need to make your company attractive to prospective buyers?</strong> Does your website need to be updated, inventory cleaned up, marketing campaigns planned? Are your bookkeeping and financial documents in order?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>How would your customers benefit from a sale?</strong> Would there be more inventory available, faster shipping times, more product options?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Who would have the ability to grow your business the way your customers needed it?</strong> A competitor, a manufacturer, a consumer?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>How is the financial climate in your industry?</strong> Is it stagnant, growing or receding?</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Where will you find a buyer?</strong> Is it in your best interest to find a broker or find one yourself through networking, conferences, industry organization or word of mouth?</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Once the decision to sell was made, I knew I needed to get my house in order.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p4">Prepping to Sell My Ecommerce Business</h2>
<h3 class="p5">1. Updating the Theme</h3>
<p class="p1">I started with cleaning the backend of my website. Think of it in the same way of staging your house to put on the market.</p>
<p class="p1">You want the charm without the personal touches:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Clean</li>
<li class="p1">Uncluttered</li>
<li class="p1">A palette for new vision without feeling sterile and uninviting</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">At this point, I was still using one of the old templates <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme-store/">from BigCommerce</a> and decided the website looked dated.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21107" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-4.png" alt="" width="640" height="330" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-4.png 1453w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-4-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-4-750x387.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I could have left it for the new owners to manage, but:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">I did not know how long it would take for me to find a buyer</li>
<li class="p1">December was a slow month in sales and the perfect time to shut down the site for maintenance</li>
<li class="p1">I could make an event out of the new site to promote sales come January 1<span class="s1">st</span>, which would look great to a prospective buyer</li>
<li class="p1">It would also help to prepare my customers to a potential change</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">When selecting a new template, I wanted something simple, where if the new owners wanted to update the logo, it wouldn’t clash with the new theme. The new theme also needed to still allow for the personality of the brand to shine through.</p>
<p class="p1">I decided to go with the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/theme/runway-bright/">Runway Bright Stencil</a> by Pixel Union. It was cheery, fully responsive and could be easily updated if necessary.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-5.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21106" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-5.png" alt="" width="640" height="330" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-5.png 1453w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-5-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-5-750x387.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p5">2. Organizing Inventory</h3>
<p class="p1">Next, I removed all products that were not in stock. I was not going to invest in add-on items during our transition period and I did not want our site to appear empty to potential buyers or customers.</p>
<p class="p1">I also condensed our product categories.</p>
<p class="p1">Having so many categories made our website look cluttered and uninviting. Instead I re-organized and streamlined the flow.</p>
<p class="p6"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21108" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="352" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-3.png 1157w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-3-300x165.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-3-750x413.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">I also updated <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/following-best-practices-product-images/">all our product images</a> and included photos of how our stamps were used on cards.</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted the inspiration for our designs to be available for not only the customer, but for the buyer as well. They weren’t just purchasing our company, they were inheriting our brand, our designs and the personality behind it.</p>
<p class="p1">They needed to be inspired –– inspired by our website, our products, reviews, social media, customers and design team.</p>

<h3 class="p5">3. Getting Financials in Order</h3>
<p class="p1">Once I had our website updated, I started on our financials &#8211; the key first step to a favorable valuation. Not only did I update our bookkeeping records, I wanted to create a one-page quick glance reference sheet that included:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Last 3 years of sales revenue</li>
<li class="p1">% of growth per year</li>
<li class="p1">Top 10 stamps with their sales amount</li>
<li class="p1">Active wholesale accounts</li>
<li class="p1">Number of customers, orders and conversion percentage</li>
<li class="p1">Value of inventory on hand</li>
<li class="p1">Number of unique designs we owned</li>
<li class="p1">Monthly operating costs</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21111" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps.png" alt="" width="640" height="324" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps.png 1135w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-300x152.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sell-my-ecommerce-business-so-suzy-stamps-750x380.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Our annual industry conference was coming up in January and I wanted to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Take advantage of the opportunity and meet with potential buyers.</li>
<li class="p1">Be prepared with quick reference material and not an overwhelming amount of information.</li>
<li class="p1">Have specific information on hand my buyer would need to know for our industry.  They did not have a lot of time to dissect a report, if they were interested in more information, we would provide it later in the discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For now, a one-page report would be ideal for our situation.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Where to Find the Right Buyers</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Business calculators and formulas should be taken with a grain of salt. You need to know your industry and sell that industry vision to a buyer.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Since the conference was geared toward manufacturers and buyers and not open to the public, I could focus on gauging the interest from companies within our industry, which would become invaluable when it came to determine the actual sale price.</p>
<p class="p1">It was during the conference that I received a valuable piece of advice from another stamp company owner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">A competitor does not hold the value of your business as high as a consumer or manufacturer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Primarily, since many of my customers are their customers, my customer database brings in zero value. The designs and sentiment stamps we carry also bring in little value as there is a good chance we have overlapping or similar designs.</p>
<p class="p1">In other words, my initial asking price just took a big kick to the pants, but it also reinforced that business calculators and formulas should be taken with a grain of salt –– which is why it is so important for you to know your industry and the type of seller you want to attract.</p>
<h2 class="p4">How Various Buyers Value an Online Business</h2>
<p class="p1">For me, my top three candidates for business valuation were Manufacturer, Competitor and Consumer and each had their pros and cons, it just depended on what my needs were.</p>
<h3 class="p5">1. Manufacturer</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Sells their services to other stamp companies so their client database is made up of store owners, not consumers</li>
<li class="p1">By manufacturing and selling to the consumer, they will have a higher ROI</li>
<li class="p1">They could recoup the cost of the purchase quicker</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Biggest benefit:</strong> </em>These factors equal a more perceived value in your business and a higher sale price.</p>
<h3 class="p5">2. Competitor</h3>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Same customer base</li>
<li class="p1">Duplicate design</li>
<li class="p1">Established website</li>
<li class="p1">Your company would integrate with theirs and your designs as a brand they offer</li>
<li class="p1">Your existing inventory is worth approximately 35% of cost</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Biggest drawback:</strong></em> Essentially, your company holds little value and would have a low sale price.</p>
<h3 class="p5">3. Consumer</h3>
<p class="p1">This is someone who is active and educated in your industry who wants to just “take over” what you have built.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Complete turnkey business is an asset</li>
<li class="p1">Website has high value</li>
<li class="p1">Customer database and social media presence has high value</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>Biggest value:</strong> </em>Greater value in your business as the hard part is done and equals higher sale price.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Timing is Everything</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">You want your reputation to remain intact – which is why timing is so important.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">In most cases, you will be focused on a consumer or manufacturer, but you also need to factor in your “why.”</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Why are you selling?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you need out sooner rather than later?</li>
<li class="p1">Can you wait for the perfect buyer who can meet your asking price?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you are in dire need to sell, a competitor may be your best option.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">They have the funds to purchased</li>
<li class="p1">You won’t be required to stay on longer during transition</li>
<li class="p1">Relatively painless</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you have time and your main motivation for selling is to ensure your customers are taken care of, a manufacturer may be your best option.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">They have the funds to purchase</li>
<li class="p1">You may be asked to help during the transition</li>
<li class="p1">Your customers will be happy as their needs will be met</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Imagine if you could have walked into your dream business and instantly started to see the sales pour in: the customers, brand awareness, the hours of sleep you would enjoy, lack of stress, wouldn’t that be heaven?</p>
<p class="p1">That is what a consumer buyer will be getting.</p>
<p class="p1">They get it all. Everything you did, everything you have and everything in the pipeline has value. But…</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Do they have the funds up front?</li>
<li class="p1">Would you consider payments?</li>
<li class="p1">Would you be willing to stay and help through a transition period?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you have time to wait for a buyer to come up with funds, going for a consumer buyer could be the most lucrative. However, you want to look at your business trends.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">If business is typically slow in Q4, do you want to sell to someone who may be disappointed in the lack of profit?</li>
<li class="p1">Do you want their perception of you be tainted due to the ebb and flow of seasonality?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Regardless of whether you warned them about the slow months, you want your reputation to remain intact, not slandered.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to selling to a consumer, keep your timing in mind. In the end, you will all benefit from it.</p>
<h2 class="p4">How to Transition Profitably</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We turned the change of ownership into a fun and wonderful time, with clear direction of who was now in charge.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">First things first, I sold my business to a manufacturer. And not just any manufacturer. I sold it to the manufacturer that helped me to grow the business in the first place by providing all of the quality stamps I needed in the timeframes that I needed them.</p>
<p class="p1">It was clear they knew how to handle demand and that they made quality products. Both of those were especially important to me in selling the business. I had built trust with my audience, and I didn’t want to hand them off to a seller I wasn’t sure knew how to keep up with demand and quality in sync.</p>
<p class="p1">I sold the business to them in the first quarter of 2017. One of the key reasons I wanted to sell in the first quarter is because traditionally Q1 and Q2 are our most profitable months. The new owner could easily see a profit from their investment in the first 6 months if purchased at the right time.</p>
<p class="p1">I also scheduled specific promotions and marketing campaigns throughout the first half of the year.</p>
<p class="p1">We had new releases, anniversary celebration, month long collaborations with other companies, we sponsored events that drew in new customers and we celebrated the new owners.</p>
<p class="p1">We turned the change of ownership into a fun and wonderful time, with clear direction of who was now in charge.</p>
<p class="p1">When I asked how they felt at the end of their first month, John replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“I haven’t smiled this much in a long time.” While Vicky quickly added, “he also hasn’t seen the sun in a month.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">When selling your company, it’s about making everyone feel confident and successful.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Put together a marketing plan that they can implement</li>
<li class="p1">Offer to help them during the transition</li>
<li class="p1">Answer the questions they have</li>
<li class="p1">Give them feedback if they ask, but keep in mind this is their baby now.  They need to make the decisions that are best for them and the vision they have for their new business.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p4">How to Transition Peacefully</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Don’t sabotage the new owners by being aloof and non-existent.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Now that you have sold your business, what happens now?</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Where do you go?</li>
<li class="p1">What do you do?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If the new owners are receptive, plan an event to celebrate. First, put your customers at ease by being active on social media. Put on a happy and positive front, address them directly, introduce the new owners, tell them why you sold, if appropriate.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, you know your customers and what needs to be done to put them at ease.</p>
<p class="p1">Don’t sabotage the new owners by being aloof and non-existent. The more successful their first month is, the more valuable you become.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Learning to Let Go: Starting a New Chapter</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur and there is always another dream to grow.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">There is one aspect you can’t plan for and the one that sneaks up on you with no warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">The emotional roller coaster of letting go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The joy, relief, sadness, fear and pride. It’s very similar to watching your child graduate from high school and then move out, get married, and have a family of their own.</p>
<p class="p1">They will always be your child, but now it’s time for them to make a life for themselves. A lot of times without your opinion or consent, as much as that may frustrate you, it’s part of the process.</p>
<p class="p1">The “baby” I gave birth to, raised, nurtured and cultivated into a successful young business will always be a part of me, but for her to continue to grow, I needed to let go and move on.</p>
<p class="p1">I needed to let the new owners take her in the direction they envisioned.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s my turn to sit back, relish in my achievements and start building a new chapter in my life. Because let’s face it, once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur and there is always another dream to grow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">You don&#8217;t really know what you&#8217;re doing until you&#8217;ve lost $1M of your own money in 1 year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">In 2013, that’s exactly what happened to me and my brothers’ business, Dazadi.</p>
<p class="p1">It was the worst year on record for the then 11-year-old company, which is saying a lot. After all, we started the business in 2002, directly in the aftermath of the DotCom bubble burst.</p>
<p class="p1">Add to that the fact that my brothers and I didn&#8217;t come from a business family. I had a business degree at the time, but I had gotten that and then joined the Marines and forgot just about everything I learned while in business school.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, we built our $22,000,000 business by learning from our failures. And losing a million of our own hard earned money in 2013 was one of our biggest.</p>

<h2 class="p3">The Hard Learned Lesson That Lost Us $1,000,000</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We chased market share instead of profitability. That’s really just a nice way to say we let our ego get ahead of our gut.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">How did it happen?</p>
<p class="p1">Easy –– we chased market share instead of profitability. That’s really just a nice way to say we let our ego get ahead of our gut.</p>
<p class="p1">And why wouldn’t we have? Back then, ecommerce was so much easier.</p>
<p class="p1">When we started the company, we were only website-based. Life was great. We paid a nickel-a-click to a company called Overture, which was eventually bought by Yahoo, to drive traffic to the website.</p>
<p class="p1">Like I said, life was great. We went from $100,000 in year one, to $1,000,000 in year two, to $2,000,000 in year three.</p>
<p class="p1">It was too easy.</p>
<p class="p1">But then, we got a phone call from Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2002, eBay was a very successful online marketplace, but we could never figure it out. It was complicated and the fee structures were hard. We just went away from it, and from marketplaces as a whole.</p>
<p class="p1">But when Amazon called us in 2004, the timing and the structure were right. The model was simple. There was only one fee. We didn’t have to pay until the sale happened and we knew for a fact that Amazon got a lot more eyeballs than we did. It didn’t matter to us that at the time they were just selling books and CDs. You could see the trajectory.</p>
<p class="p1">For many years after that, Amazon was a smaller portion of our business compared to the direct traffic to Dazadi.com.</p>
<p class="p1">But it was always growing –– and business was good. <em>It was very good.</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">Unthinkable Act #1: No One Buys Table Tennis Tables in a Recession</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">What do they call it? Throwing your money at a problem? Yeah, we did that.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Then the 2008 financial crisis hit. Turns out that when half the country loses their job, they don&#8217;t need a table tennis table. They&#8217;re going to use their money to buy groceries instead.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s when we did the unthinkable.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead of focusing on profitability, we decided to expand our product offering to cover more of the market. Instead of looking at what was selling well, and doubling down there, we spread ourselves thin –– and hired a director of marketing.</p>
<p class="p1">What do they call it? Throwing your money at a problem?</p>
<p class="p1">Yeah, we did that.</p>
<p class="p1">That brings us to 2013 –– when we lost a million dollars from our bottom line.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">We were selling goods at market rate</li>
<li class="p1">Not buying them at a price to support that low price at a profit</li>
<li class="p1">Then, chasing the sale despite not making profits with the hopes that our volume would back us into lower cost of goods</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This only works when you pick good, fast-moving products, and it never works with everything.</p>
<p class="p1">And us, well, we tried it with everything.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">It was the wrong time</li>
<li class="p1">It was the wrong strategy</li>
<li class="p1">And it cost us –– big time</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">It also taught us something vitally important to every business. That is, double down in the area where your revenue is generated.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s how we came back from a $1,000,000 loss in one year.</p>
<h2 class="p3">What to Do When You’ve Lost $1,000,000</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We shut down the marketing department and went all in with marketplaces.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">What we did in the aftermath of that disastrous year is we looked at all of our SKUs. We were getting a lot of sales, but we were losing a lot of money on a lot of SKUs. So, we cut the bad SKUS and we zeroed in on what was working.</p>
<p class="p1">Ironically, what was working the best, and what we had the most control over, were a handful of items on Amazon. So, we put that under the microscope.</p>
<p class="p1">We figured out the system for profitability on Amazon, and then we expanded that system to many other SKUs. That’s how we got back to being a profitable company.</p>
<p class="p1">But once again, we had to do the unthinkable.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is the hard truth we had to sit with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;ll keep the website, but we&#8217;re not very good at it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">We were spending all of our money on marketing that wasn’t generating any sales –– whereas on Amazon, sales were rolling in.</p>
<p class="p1">And if 2013 taught us anything, it was that we had to focus on revenue –– not on perception (or desired perception).</p>
<p class="p1">So, we shut down the marketing department and went all in with marketplaces.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s when we really started winning.</p>
<p class="p1">Once we focused on where our revenue was coming from, dove in and figured out the system, our profitability skyrocketed. Then, we built out our profitability reporting and a bunch of special stuff in our ERP system.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Everything was just humming along.</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">Carefully Shifting a Profitable Model to Additional Channels</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">To do anything on OSCommerce cost money and time and resources we felt were better spent on our marketplace sales.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Except that the whole time we were winning, we knew that anything can happen on a marketplace like Amazon and that in order to really add value to Dazadi, we needed to be growing our customer base on Dazadi.com and driving more sales there.</p>
<p class="p1">And to make that happen, we really needed to shift our mentality.</p>
<p class="p1">We didn’t see ourselves as a marketing company. We had been burned. Plus, we were on OSCommerce at the time, always had been.</p>
<p class="p1">We had our own developers and development team –– and still, the platform wasn’t feature-rich enough to really win at marketing.</p>
<p class="p1">To do anything on OSCommerce cost money and time and resources we felt were better spent on our marketplace sales. So finding a new platform was the most crucial piece for us.</p>
<p class="p1">We knew that the path of getting back to driving sales and traffic to Dazadi.com was having a really good ecommerce platform.</p>
<p class="p1">And, because we had developed and iterated on an open source platform for so many years, we knew exactly what we were looking for and we knew what we needed –– and what we didn’t.</p>
<p class="p1">So, we got to work. We interviewed probably half a dozen different service providers, and figured out one important thing. Here is where we landed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">It was going to take us 5 years to get caught up with everyone else if we went with open source or custom build. We needed a platform that had everything we needed right then already built-in, and one with extensible APIs we could connect to our home grown ERP system.</p>
<p class="p1">That meant we were looking at a SaaS solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">That led us to Shopify Plus –– and doing yet another unthinkable thing.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Unthinkable Act #2: We Don’t Want a Plug-in For That</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We were clearly trying to find a platform on which we’d grow to $100,000,000, to $200,000,000, to $500,000,000 in revenue, and Shopify Plus just didn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Here’s the thing: I personally was very frustrated with my experience in communicating with Shopify. We had several meetings with them and to every question, the answer seemed to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We think we have a plug-in for that.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">So we said, OK –– and I had my team go and research all the plugins we’d need. That got us here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">If we have to identify all the plugins, and then we have to integrate those and test each individual one to make sure it works and does what we want it to do –– well, then we might as well build the platform ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">In fact, one of my most frustrating calls in which I almost hung up on them was when they didn&#8217;t understand freight. They just didn&#8217;t understand the furniture market.</p>
<p class="p1">It was a frustrating sales experience.</p>
<p class="p1">We were clearly trying to find a platform on which we’d grow to $100,000,000, to $200,000,000, to $500,000,000 in revenue, and Shopify Plus just didn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p class="p1">Turns out, BigCommerce was the only platform that had the system on which we could build out everything we needed in a very short and easy manner.</p>
<p class="p1">No one else could do it.</p>
<p class="p1">Better yet, the BigCommerce team totally got that we were trying to do. For freight, for instance, they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Oh yeah, we&#8217;ve got lots of furniture people. We know exactly what you&#8217;re talking about. We know exactly what freight is.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">For us, that’s the biggest thing. Of course everyone knows about small packages. That’s easy. Freight is not easy and the fact that BigCommerce embraced that and had the features built-in to allow us to do what we needed to do –– well, that was the selling point for me.</p>
<p class="p1">These days, internally, we call BigCommerce the “grown up platform” because it literally had every single feature built into it that we needed.</p>
<p class="p1">And, those features are built-in the grownup way. They are in there for the complex business –– businesses like us who have been on the IR 1000 list for 8 years running.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, we can finally focus on building the marketing plan that our Dazadi customers and the Dazadi company deserve.</p>
<p class="p1">So, how are we planning to do that? How are we taking these lessons and applying them to the future? Great question –- and it leads us to our next unthinkable act.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Growing to $100M and Beyond</h3></p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">Unthinkable Act #3: The Decision to Give Up $2,000,000 in Revenue</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I cried myself to sleep for about a week after we cut that revenue.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">One thing we did as we began to ramp up our marketing expertise was to cut out all of our drop shippers. Doing that meant we cut out probably $2,000,000 of annual revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">I cried myself to sleep for about a week after we cut that revenue, but I think at the end of the day it makes us a stronger brand and a better company.</p>
<p class="p1">That doesn’t mean that becoming a 100% inventory business wasn’t really, really painful.</p>
<p class="p1">It very much was.</p>
<p class="p1">The reason we did it, though, is because we noticed that our performance metrics, on time delivery and order errors were significantly higher with our drop shippers than they were with our own inventory, with our own fulfillment centers.</p>
<p class="p1">We did our due diligence to work with our partners at those drop shippers for years, trying to improve those metrics and ended up finding out that they just couldn&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p class="p1">We needed to make a drastic change.</p>
<p class="p1">So, we set out to open additional fulfillment centers and end our drop shipping relationships.  Today, we have four across the country, excluding the stuff we send off to Amazon FBA.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, because we do not drop shipping anymore, we’ve significantly reduced the amount of SKUs we offer. We&#8217;re in the process of ramping that up, but doing so differently than we ever have before.</p>
<p class="p1">This time, we&#8217;re adding our own private label products and exclusive SKUs you can’t get anywhere else on the web. This means most of our now 16,000 SKUs have their own UPC codes.</p>
<p class="p1">It also means that we now have the time to look at each individual listing as an asset.</p>
<p class="p1">We are putting a lot more energy into product page SEO and optimizing each page as though it is a product page to drive increased conversions so we can add more SKU variation as we have the revenue to do so.</p>
<p class="p1">What we’ve learned is that by having much fewer SKUs, we can really give each listing its due.</p>
<p class="p1">And it’s working. As of writing, search traffic has the second highest conversion rate on the site, falling only behind campaign generated traffic.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, let’s talk about those campaigns.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Our Plan to Build a Powerhouse Marketing Organization</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I’ve had it ingrained in my head for too long that any time we have to do an integration, we have to do it ourselves. But we don’t. Not anymore.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">First things first, I’m having to unlearn years of open source constraints.</p>
<p class="p1">I still talk to my team about building out a consumer financing option and how we can integrate that into the site. And then, I talk to BigCommerce and they already have a Beta running, and other customers using it and they can tell me if it&#8217;s working –– or if it’s a waste of my time.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve had it ingrained in my head for too long that any time we have to do an integration, we have to do it ourselves.</p>
<p class="p1">But we don’t. Not anymore.</p>
<p class="p1">So, this is where we are starting in our marketing and our campaigns –– not on building integrations, but on installing apps and services and moving forward with our plans.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Optimizing for Conversion</h3>
<p class="p1">Beyond optimizing for SEO by providing better product pages (and better quality products), we’ve also integrated with an optimizer.</p>
<p class="p1">With it, we&#8217;re looking at all of our different pages and finding out which ones have the highest bounce rate. Then, we’re iterating on them and doing some A/B testing to improve the performance and the conversion rates on those pages and across the board.</p>
<p class="p1">This is an area where BigCommerce is ahead of the game, in my opinion, by offering a  one-page checkout. The experience is so clean –– and the integration with Amazon Pay will work to help convert our former Amazon customers to webstore customers (as well as anyone else who uses Amazon, which everyone does).</p>
<p class="p1">That’s an integration I haven&#8217;t had anything to do with. It is just there. Ready for me and anyone else on the platform to use.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s on the checkout page where consumer financing will be live, too. Even there, we have options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/klarna/">Klarna</a></li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/paypal/">PayPal</a></li>
<li class="p1">AfterPay</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Those solutions speak to different audiences, and as we look to move international, will help us to optimize for conversions across locations.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Laser Targeting Consumers on Facebook and Google</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">I remember the glory days of Google AdWords, where it was a nickel-a-click.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Like I mentioned earlier, our campaign driven traffic is our highest converting on the site (year to date).</p>
<p class="p1">That’s because we have been looking at Facebook audiences and building audiences from people who&#8217;ve bought from us in the past and who like our products.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re beginning to drive traffic to specific landing pages that are optimized and ready for those ad campaigns and retargeting as well. We’ll do the same thing with Google AdWords.</p>
<p class="p1">All signs are pointing to the fact that this is really going to work.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, we identified 22,000 customers from our <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/ecommerce-analytics/">BigCommerce Analytics</a> that bought products from us last year. And we were able to find 17,000 of those on Facebook to create an audience.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s all really exciting.</p>
<p class="p1">I remember the glory days of Google AdWords, where it was a nickel-a-click. I also remember when it became $5-a-click and you couldn&#8217;t make money anymore. It was kind of throwing mud on a wall to see what stuck and you really couldn&#8217;t narrow in.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, with Facebook audiences and what you can do in Google, you aren’t throwing mud on a wall. Instead, they’ve given you a pinpoint laser where we can really go right to the customer who&#8217;s bought from us and likes our stuff and make them different offerings to bring them back.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s amazing how sophisticated things have gotten.</p>
<p class="p1">I got a friend who is an infomercial legend in Seattle. He’s been doing this sort of thing on television for a long time with all their Nielsen data. It&#8217;s nice to see that digital is caught up, and taking that to the next level to laser focus in on an exact customer.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Email Marketing to Customer Cohorts</h3>
<p class="p1">Email marketing is another big area we’re focusing on. I&#8217;m embarrassed to say that we didn&#8217;t do a lot of email marketing last year, but we&#8217;re changing that this year.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re looking at gathering more data about our customers when they come to the site and segmenting those lists in a way that we were never able to do before.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, we’ll drive them to optimized landing pages, which are on the BigCommerce platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that we feel we are best-in-class in our category, it&#8217;s really exciting to be able to focus on driving more traffic to our site and going after and learning these new and much more sophisticated ways to drive sales.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s really exciting time for me. I love learning, so this has been a nice journey.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We are going to win. I know that now.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">We are going to win. I know that now. That’s what this whole journey has been about –– removing the fear of failure. It was a steep learning curve. We’ve both lost millions and made millions, and we’ve come out the other end smarter and stronger for every moment.</p>
<p class="p1">That is what I’m most proud of, that we haven’t been deterred when we’ve failed. We just keep carrying on. We put things out in the wild and see how it works. We adjust. We learn. And we continue to build our family business.</p>

<p class="p1">“I come from a family of artists, so it is safe to say I have an eye for color. When I started my design process, I wanted to evoke an overall feeling of calm and peace, therefore I choose this color blue,” says Melissa Bamberg, Founder of NodPod. “Next, the logo came about after doodling many months on paper. I wanted the shape to represent the product. Then a name – the nod in Nodpod is to represent sleep, and then pod to represent the shape of the eye mask, as it looks like a pea pod. Once I had my logo, name and color decided upon, I could visualize the design of the website.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I was, and continue to be, inspired by Apple store products, as they are such innovators and leaders in design.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We just recently finished the website, and I am now working on SEO to help increase my stores brand and awareness. Based on the feedback I get from customers, I am humbled to have created a product that people ‘can’t sleep without.&#8217;”</p>

<p class="p1">“When moving from WooCommerce, I looked at Shopify and at Squarespace. None of them really could handle the volume I was doing with all of the features I was looking for. I had a laundry list of needs,” says Chris Bair, Founder and CEO of KetoChow. “For example, I needed to have product variations because the product I sell has different flavors. That was one of the things that needed to be out-of-the-box. I also needed a ShipStation integration so I could do dimensional shipping. BigCommerce was the ecommerce platform that had checked off the most boxes.”</p>

<p>Before he would take on big Pharma, well-known celebrity-endorsed brands and a legion of pediatricians, Peter started with a simple search.</p>
<p>It was 4 a.m. He sat slumped over his computer, fingers lightly resting on the keyboard, eyes red from staring at the screen much too long –– the letters G-O-O-G-L-E staring right back at him.</p>
<p>One of the boys lets out another cry.</p>
<p>He wakes his sister. And then –– all three of the newborn triplets are screaming. They’d only been silent –– asleep, Peter assumed –– for 30 minutes. He and his wife both head to the room –– for the sixth time that night.</p>
<p>Four adult arms to deal with three distraught babies isn’t enough. The colic-derived cries echo even after they subside.</p>
<p>Peter’s back at the computer. The clock is ticking. Any moment now, one of the babies will wake –– and like a siren, the siblings will bring their new, sleep-deprived parents back to their bedside.</p>
<p>He slowly types “baby formula and colic” into the search bar and hits enter.</p>
<p>He can’t believe his eyes.</p>
<h2>When &#8220;Doctor Recommended&#8221; Goes Awry</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17814" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PennieTriplets174.jpg" alt="pennietriplets174" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PennieTriplets174.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PennieTriplets174-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Weeks earlier the babies had been in the NICU. Babies born as part of multiple birth pregnancies are common patients there. Peter’s children endured a three week stay.</p>
<p>Having used a gestational surrogate for the pregnancy, breastfeeding was not an option. Instead the babies were fed donated, banked breast milk and were later sent home with a special preemie formula that only hospitals receive.</p>
<p>That formula quickly ran out –– and the triplets were transferred to their pediatrician- recommended formula.</p>
<p>“We found when we got home they were constantly gassy, fussy, colicky in general,” says Peter. “They just didn&#8217;t seem happy. Their intestines made these monstrous noises which made us think something was definitely wrong.”</p>
<p>Peter and his wife lead an active and relatively healthy life. They have not been immune to the U.S.’s shift in nutritional trends –– from Hostess-wrapped goods to sustainable kale. This shift is what led him to even considering the formula as a possible cause to the fussy effect.</p>
<p>That “colic baby formula” Google search he performed late one night brought up dozens of articles –– many of them pointing to organic European formulas.</p>
<p>“The formula,” he thought, piecing together the dots. It was a subdued Eureka moment.</p>
<p><strong>He ordered some of the formula for immediate delivery and within 24-48 hours, the babies did a 180. Everything was gone. The house fell silent. The family slept.</strong></p>
<p>The next day, Peter started to do the math. He’d need a box a day to feed the three babies. Calculate that by price of the product plus international shipping, he and his wife were looking at an expensive solution to getting everyone more shut eye.</p>
<p>To pare down the costs as much as they could, Peter ordered the formula in bulk.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, he was out grabbing beers with friends again. His mood lifted. Their sleep problems relatively solved –– overnight.</p>
<p>That’s when people started asking questions, recommending friends of friends and family over to Peter to find out where he got this magic formula.</p>
<p>Soon, he was giving away his own product as samples when an idea struck him. He began contacting sellers in Europe. He put to use his importing experience (his family were importers of Greek foods), began working from his home basement and, once that overflowed, rented a climate controlled warehouse (the formula required a temperature controlled room).</p>
<p><a href="http://organicmunchkin.com/">Organic Munchkin was born</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17835" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/organic-munchkin-1.jpg" alt="organic-munchkin-1" width="750" height="1000" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/organic-munchkin-1.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/organic-munchkin-1-300x400.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2>How Baby Formula Became a Grey Market</h2>
<p>At first, the goal was to import the goods and sell them, make a little money off his discovery and save U.S. parents some much needed sleep, while having happier babies, too.</p>
<p>But Peter’s mission quickly expanded.</p>
<p>It was obvious his family wasn’t the only one to suffer from doctor recommended formula. Formula that was FDA approved. Formula that was supposed to help, to heal, to nurture newborns as naturally as possible in place of breastmilk.</p>
<p>Peter just couldn’t let it go.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t know why they don&#8217;t connect the dots. I don&#8217;t know if these companies, the Gerbers and the Similacs, I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re,” he pauses, thinking. “I just don&#8217;t know why nobody is connecting the dots.”</p>
<p>One reason could be that the European formula isn’t FDA approved. Peter likes to say that it’s “not FDA disapproved, either.” The product has never been considered by the FDA for approval because it isn’t sold in the U.S.</p>
<p>“It’s like buying a vitamin,” says Peter.</p>
<p>The lack of FDA approval, however, does make the selling of organic baby formula a bit of a grey market. Peter is the only seller in the U.S. to distribute the German-made 100% organic formulas.</p>
<p>Even I was originally turned on to Peter and Organic Munchkin by a BigCommerce co-worker who knew firsthand the impact of Peter’s products –– the father of a newborn.</p>
<p>“Tracey, you have got to reach out to these guys,” a colleague said. “I searched forever online for a solution, for something, for anything. This was the only stuff I found –– and it works!”</p>
<p>Indeed, it does work. So well, in fact, that Peter swears by them –– providing customers a guaranteed 24-48 hour turnaround time in the improvement of their baby’s health.</p>
<p>“I stand behind that 100%,” says Peter. “Most parents are shocked by my confidence, but it never fails. We&#8217;ve had customers call it the miracle milk, liquid gold, the lifesaver. It&#8217;s a joy to open up our emails every day.”</p>
<p>“Every email is a positive review –– every one.”</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s hundreds of stories of parents who were told their baby is acting like that because they have a milk allergy, where they simply just changed to one of these European organic formulas, and the doctor was wrong. They didn&#8217;t have a milk allergy. What they had was effects from the chemicals and the sugars.”</p>
<h2>What Jessica Alba and the FDA Have in Common</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17803" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/organic-baby-formula.jpg" alt="organic-baby-formula" width="750" height="420" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/organic-baby-formula.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/organic-baby-formula-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>This is what motivates Peter on a daily basis: the ousting of chemicals and sugars in the food we feed our newborns.</p>
<p>It’s a segment of the industry that is hotly debated, and long been hockey sticking in terms of revenue and growth potential.</p>
<p>It started, perhaps, with stores like Whole Foods –– promoting more organic goods and greens for a healthy, more conscious lifestyle. Millennials quickly bit at the bait –– and soon, they were having children whom they wanted to raise within the same cultural context.</p>
<p>So brands like The Honest Company sprouted, backed by celebrity parents promoting the benefits of going organic. Even larger brands have hopped on the trend. Gap now sells organic baby clothes. Toys R Us has a dedicated organic toy section. Johnson and Johnson manufactures an entire natural line of products.</p>
<p>But like in the earlier days of organic goods and education for adults, many of these products don’t live up to their marketing hype.</p>
<p>Lawsuits continue to hammer away at The Honest Company, a brand headed by Jessica Alba, which gets quite a bit of attention and financial backing because of its star-powered, “all-natural” branding.</p>
<p>In fact, the co-founder of The Honest Company says he and Alba want larger brands to follow suit –– removing some of the “120 chemicals in their products not found in ours.”</p>
<p>And yet, as CNN and plenty of The Honest Company’s customers have found, the brand only excludes about 40 chemicals –– leaving a long line of disgruntled parents feeling misled.</p>
<h3>Watch the video below from CNN to learn more about The Honest Company</h3>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y3QswlBv7sc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>The irony isn’t missed on Peter, who explains that the difference between organic and non is simple: the ingredients.</p>
<p>“The [organic formulas] obviously work better because there&#8217;s no corn syrups. There&#8217;s no corn solids. There&#8217;s no sugars,” says Peter. “The milk source itself is of higher standards in Europe. They want quality over quantity. That&#8217;s a big factor. But it&#8217;s mostly the ingredients. There&#8217;s no chemicals. It&#8217;s a real organic formula.”</p>
<p>That’s when Peter asks if I’m familiar with The Honest Company. I clearly am.</p>
<p>“They just got sued about a month ago for them not really being organic. That&#8217;s all it is; it&#8217;s just the ingredients. That&#8217;s what makes it better. It&#8217;s a simple thing. Why isn’t [European formula] allowed here? I think it&#8217;s because the corporations don&#8217;t want them here. That&#8217;s all it is.”</p>
<p>And Peter’s on the fast track to changing that.</p>
<h2>Babies, Bulk and Bridging Ancestral Lineages</h2>
<p>Jennifer Hyman, CEO of Rent the Runway, often gently explains that she does not run an innovative fashion company, as many may think. Instead, she heads up a dry-cleaning company –– the largest in the world.</p>
<p>Peter understands this sentiment well. His own business, though primarily an organic baby formula reseller, is more about importing than it is about retail.</p>
<p>The ability to bulk import is an important one. It allows for lower cost on the items he sells so parents don’t have to pay an arm and a leg for a formula he strongly believes they deserve access to from day one of their newborn’s life.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been able to –– through our new importing process –– drop our prices significantly,” says Peter. “We offer free shipping on every order, whether it&#8217;s one box or twenty boxes, and we&#8217;ve been able to bring down prices to where, if you buy in bulk from our site, you&#8217;re basically paying the same or a couple of dollars more than an organic formula here in America.”</p>
<p>Of course, bulk importing also comes with its fair share of challenges.</p>
<p>You need space for the inventory, and with baby formula, it must be climate-controlled. Plus, dealing with international sellers to place bulk orders and negotiate rates is no simple task given the language barrier and the difference in time zone. Finally, there are bigger names he’s competing with, ones that aren’t having to handle bulk inventory and international ordering –– or at least have the headcount to do it for them.</p>
<p>Peter is used to struggle though –– and he isn’t afraid of a little hard work or competitor pushback. After all, he was born and raised in New York to immigrant parents who worked hard and instilled in him a strong work ethic as well. He struggled to start his own business and shared years of struggles with his wife trying to start a family.</p>
<p>“My parents moved [to the U.S.] from Greece, a classic immigrant story with a penny in their pockets,” says Peter. “I know what it takes to work hard because my family has been working hard since day one. I got married young, at 26. Struggled for 10 years with infertility to have a baby. We were blessed at the age of 36 with the triplets.”</p>
<p>This family dependency added an even thicker layer to an already expanding business agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feed children healthy formula from day one</li>
<li>Save parents additional nights of unrest</li>
<li>Educate the U.S. on current formula issues</li>
<li>Do it all while building upon his family’s importing legacy</li>
</ul>
<p>From New York to Germany and back again, Peter’s story spans Europe and the U.S. both in geography and generation –– adding only additional flames to his passionate fire.</p>
<p>His mission is a personal one. And he’s set his sights on infiltrating the very system he felt betrayed him: pediatricians.</p>
<h2>Using a Pharmaceutical Sales Model to Grow Organic</h2>
<p>It’s a point of confusion for Peter. I can hear it in his hesitation every time I repeat the question –– asking, as interviewers do, the same thing in a slightly different way.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t other people and businesses doing this? Why don’t pediatricians know? How did you connect the dots, but no one else?”</p>
<p>It’s a question Peter can’t answer –– but one he’s dead set on solving. After all, in the famous words of Maya Angelou, if you don’t like something, change it. If you can’t change it, change your attitude about it.</p>
<p>Peter’s doing both, and having honest talks with pediatricians who have seen flabbergasting results in their patients from his product. It’s opened a new line of communication as well as a sales channel.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of pediatricians who&#8217;ve started to contact me through customers because they&#8217;ve seen the changes,” says Petter. “What I&#8217;m trying to build now is a network of pediatricians who will give this a chance and who tell their patients to try this formula.”</p>
<p>But breaking into the medical field is no easy feat. Pharmaceutical companies have long held domain expertise in this arena –– and it’s rare for an outsider to make their way in.</p>
<p>Then again, doctors deal with people. And nothing is more powerful than word-of-mouth, especially with educated, well-traveled parents already up to speed with the benefits of all-natural foods and diets.</p>
<p>“This doesn&#8217;t happen in Europe, but here in the U.S. when a baby gets constipated or colicky, many pediatricians will automatically recommend parents use baby Zantac or just use these horrible formulas,” says Peter. “The more specialized the formula, the worse the ingredients. There are some formulas where the first couple of ingredients are corn syrup and corn solids. You don’t want to feed that to your baby. We find that most kids just have a cow&#8217;s protein breakdown problem, so by switching to a goat&#8217;s milk, which most people were raised on in the early 1900&#8217;s, that resolves the problem instantly.”</p>
<p>This is the type of information Peter is bringing to pediatricians, urging less immediate use of pharmaceuticals and more flexibility in formula makeup. It’s a grassroots movement, but he’s heavily supported by families across the country who are discovering all on their own the benefits to an alternative, all-natural method.</p>
<h2>The Future of a Free Market Organic Formula</h2>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-17804" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/organic-baby-formula-1.png" alt="organic-baby-formula-1" width="635" height="346" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/organic-baby-formula-1.png 635w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/organic-baby-formula-1-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /></center>Organic Munchkin is coming near full circle in only two and a half years in business. Peter has solidified a stronghold in a niche market. He’s avoided fraudulent lawsuits his competitors typically handle by remaining true to his core mission. And now, he’s bringing pediatricians along with him, altering the medical recommendations of baby formula one doctor at a time.</p>
<p>It’s a lot to accomplish in just two years –– and yet, the next two look equally bright.</p>
<p>Peter has already begun bringing on products outside of baby formula. The brands he imports offer additional goods –– cereals, snacks, juices and baby care. As his business grows, so do the children of his first customers, parents who are as loyal to German brands like Holle and Lebenswert as older generations were to Gerber.</p>
<p>And soon, Peter plans to launch his own line, staying ever true to all-natural ingredients and working hand-in-hand with U.S. regulations. He’ll be one of the first to bring an organic line of baby formula before the FDA.</p>
<p>And by then, he’ll have thousands of supporters –– well-rested and fed, newborns to grandparents –– backing his name.</p>
<p><strong>The power of parents will soon turn this grey market free.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It was a typical work day for Alex Young in 2012. He was at the Kap7 headquarters, his employer&#8217;s office. It was lunch time, a Wednesday maybe. He had a friend&#8217;s event that weekend and needed something … shoes, a pair of pants.</p>
<p class="p1">It doesn&#8217;t really matter, because, as usual, he was shopping on Amazon. A tried, tested and trusted 2-day delivery was in his grasp. It didn&#8217;t matter what he bought, or how late he bought it; he knew he would be able to get the item in his hands for when he needed it.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, Alex and the rest of his co-workers, including the former Olympian founders of the company, Wolf Wigo and Brad Schumacher, all regularly shopped on Amazon. And they did this while running their own, independent online store.</p>
<p class="p1">On one of those quick Amazon shopping days, Alex did a query for the product his company sold:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>“Water Polo Ball”</em></p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s hard to say what Alex saw years ago, but today, you do a similar search and two brands clearly dominate on Amazon: Misaka and Alex&#8217;s own Kap7. And Kap7 is the only one that is NCAA and NFHS official.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-17434 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/amazon-success-stories-1.png" alt="amazon-success-stories-1" width="619" height="315" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/amazon-success-stories-1.png 619w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/amazon-success-stories-1-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Kap7 also sells water polo swimwear, so I did a quick search for that, too.</p>
<p class="p1">This small, 7-person company headquartered in L.A. comes up third on Amazon, right behind Nike. That&#8217;s one heck of a search engine optimization success story.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="wp-image-17433 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/amazon-success-stories-2.png" alt="amazon-success-stories-2" width="507" height="402" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/amazon-success-stories-2.png 507w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/amazon-success-stories-2-300x238.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" /></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Note: Turbo is Kap7&#8217;s water polo suit brand. </em></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We were personally shopping on Amazon all the time, and there wasn&#8217;t anyone that was selling our type of products there,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;We needed to take advantage of that. None of our direct competitors have moved onto Amazon yet, so we are ahead of the game in the water polo market. Once you have it dialed-in [to Amazon], it runs itself.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Alex thinks about Amazon as simply another sales channel for his business. Of course, Amazon does play by different rules than a typical webstore.</p>
<p class="p1">For instance, Kap7 can often make 50% margin off of its products. On Amazon, that may go down to 25%.</p>
<p class="p1">But a 50% decrease in margins for a highly trafficked and high sales channel doesn’t cause a bit of concern for Alex and his team. They have full control over their marketplace selling, understand the industry and when it will spike, and know that different customers shop in vastly different ways.</p>
<p class="p1">For Kap7, control, sales and buyer personas make the expansion to Amazon a success — and a no-brainer.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;There are people who only shop on Amazon, and there are people who want to shop on direct <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/best-ecommerce-website-design/">ecommerce sites</a>. Both sets of people are growing,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;Water polo is growing extremely fast in the U.S., and we can get spikes in orders. If we get low on inventory for a product we have to order in bulk, like balls, we will turn off our marketplaces and keep selling on our website.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote">There are people who only shop on Amazon, and there are people who want to shop on direct ecommerce sites. Both sets of people are growing.<div class="post-detail__quote-author">Alex Young, <a href="http://www.kap7.com/" target="_blank">Kap7</a></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">This level of control and ability to turn on and off selling options on Amazon as needed gives the Kap7 team, and Alex in particular, the freedom to use the webstore in unique ways. For Alex, Amazon revenue is a known. It will come in. People are shopping there.</p>
<p class="p1">On a webstore, it’s a different story.</p>
<p class="p1">Amazon already has an audience. Independent websites must build an audience –– and that’s tough work. But with Amazon as a steady source of income, Alex has figured out how to use additional tools –– like Google AdWords and Google Shopping –– to target consumers elsewhere on the web and bring them back to a dedicated website targeting their specific needs.</p>
<p class="p1">After all, you can customize a website to serve a buyer’s persona. With Amazon, you’re going for keywords and mass relevance.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We do a lot of marketing to the end-user, who is the age-group athlete, and then the purchaser who is the parents. We try to loop things around with product reviews and videos, and water polo drills and tips,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;We use BigCommerce to power our ecommerce website, which also gives us more opportunity to focus on really specific groups. For example, we focused on selling Alaska-printed suits to people in Alaska using Google AdWords, and they sold really well for about six months.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>That’s right, the combined power of Amazon and independent webstore earned a water polo company in L.A. a buying audience in Alaska. That’s how to optimize sales channels.</strong></p>
<h2 class="p3">Uncovering 100% Growth on Amazon through Search</h2>
<p class="p1">We’re in L.A. again. This time, in the home of Emily Ironi, the sole founder and employee of The Dairy Fairy –– a quickly growing nursing bra company serving the likes of Zoe Saldana and Chrissy Teigen.</p>
<p class="p1">But this is no celebrity-only brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Little over three years ago, Emily Ironi was a new, working and single mom. And like any parent, she wanted to give her kid the best shot at life. To her, breastfeeding was a part of that legacy.</p>
<p class="p1">The selection of nursing bras she found, however, were not.</p>
<p class="p1">To Emily, they looked like medieval torture devices. They weren’t attractive. They weren’t comfortable. And even though they did the job, allowing a woman to breastfeed with a bra on, they left much to be desired.</p>
<p class="p1">For one, postpartum is real –– and no new mom wants to be made to feel unattractive simply by trying to feed her baby.</p>
<p class="p1">For two, the pointy and uncomfortable nature made nursing bras near impossible to actually wear as a bra. Instead, you&#8217;d need to wear another bra, and then change into the nursing bras before nursing to achieve maximum comfort and functionality from what was on the market.</p>
<p class="p1">No one has time for any of that.</p>
<p class="p1">So, Emily made her own bra –– patent pending. Today, new moms and older ones alike wear that bra, many of them choosing to continue wearing the bra beyond breastfeeding thanks to its comfort, support and … well … let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s pretty.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2013, she launched her online store –– and immediately, sales began rolling in. She’d found a niche market. Customers were finding her by Google and bloggers.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, in October of 2015, she looked to Amazon and launched a test run.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Sales doubled.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Amazon&#8217;s been incredible for my business. I <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-selling-strategies/">started selling on Amazon</a> in October of 2015, and it&#8217;s doubled my sales,&#8221; says Emily. &#8220;What that tells me is that there&#8217;s a whole slew of people who didn&#8217;t know I existed, and they&#8217;d just go in and type ‘hands-free pumping bra.&#8217; It&#8217;s working way better than a Google search for me.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Amazon search outperforming Google’s isn’t surprising. Research has shown that 44% of all product searches start on Amazon. If you rely solely on Google search to bring in customers, your first competitor to sell on Amazon will mop up all the buyers that search there first –– much like Kap7 did.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about it. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seo-strategy/">Amazon is a search engine for products</a> that likely has your credit card on file, allowing you to checkout in a single click. It’s arguably the easiest shopping destination in the world. If you have an audience that is busy (and all of us are), Amazon is the quickest, most convenient shopping solution for them.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote">I find that it&#8217;s still critical to have your own retail presence. I have a lot of peers, especially in the baby products industry, their businesses were 100% on Amazon, and now they&#8217;re starting to catch up and trying to migrate more of their business to their own websites.<div class="post-detail__quote-author">Emily Ironi, <a href="http://shop.thedairyfairy.com/" target="_blank">The Dairy Fairy</a></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">That doesn&#8217;t mean, though, that your own website isn&#8217;t relevant.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Amazon as a business is becoming more of a competitor to some of the brands, and bringing out their own products,&#8221; says Emily. &#8220;I find that it&#8217;s still critical to have your own retail presence. I have a lot of peers, especially in the baby products industry, their businesses were 100% on Amazon, and now they&#8217;re starting to catch up and trying to migrate more of their business to their own websites. Ultimately, you have a lot more control over everything and also your interaction with customers. It&#8217;s about finding that perfect balance.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="p3">Customer’s Choice: Using Data to Sell the Products They Want Where They Want Them</h2>
<p class="p1">Relative to Austin Bazaar, The Dairy Fairy and Kap7 are newbies to Amazon. Seetha Singh, the owner of the instrument retailer, launched her webstore almost simultaneously with her Amazon presence back in 2007 –– nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p class="p1">Her goal then and now is still them same: be wherever the customer is. Cost-effectiveness is high on her list as well.</p>
<p class="p1">“We wanted to be present wherever customers for our products like to shop,” says Seetha. “Selling direct and via third party channels has helped us broaden our reach. Selling on Amazon affords us the benefit of reaching millions of Amazon customers without spending the advertising dollars up-front.”</p>
<p class="p1">And as you might expect from such a seasoned Amazon seller, Seetha has drafted a comprehensive <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/multi-channel-selling/">multi-channel strategy</a> for Austin Bazaar.</p>
<p class="p1">The company’s Amazon success is no fluke.</p>
<p class="p1">It took years of sales data and multiple iterations in the analyzing to determine which products sell best on the channel, and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seller-fees-costs-analytics/">how to optimize each selling point for the highest conversion</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote">We do not offer the same products on all channels.The selection offered on each channel depends on the strengths of that channel and the kind of consumers that they attract.<div class="post-detail__quote-author">Seetha Singh, <a href="http://www.austinbazaar.com/" target="_blank">Austin Bazaar</a></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We do not offer the same products on all channels,&#8221; says Seetha. &#8220;We offer our best selections on our webstore, but also have products that are unique to each channel. The selection offered on each channel depends on the strengths of that channel and the kind of consumers that they attract. By offering specialized inventory on our webstore, we are better able to mitigate the effects of cannibalization that can occur when multi-channel selling.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">For Seetha, marketplaces like Amazon are just the right places to be. Too many consumers are already shopping there for any retailer to ignore it. Getting in front of your customers in the way they want to shop is the most important part of selling success.</p>
<p class="p1">Your website can offer the who, what, when, where and why –– but your customers get the final say in how.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Too Much of a Good Thing</h2>
<p class="p1">Know this: Amazon is not a set-it-and-forget-it channel. You can go too big. It&#8217;s possible you&#8217;ll need to pull back. But then again, is that the worst problem to have?</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Make sure you are focused on the channels you already have in place, so they are running themselves. Then step over to the next channel and build that,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;The biggest mistake we made is we tried to go full-bore on all of them – Etsy, Jet, eBay. We&#8217;ve actually pulled it all back because we want to focus on each one, make sure it&#8217;s perfect and understand why products are selling well, or not. Once they&#8217;re running well it&#8217;s just a management and maintenance scenario, which is not that big of a deal.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">First, do the competitor research; then launch in the channel; finally use product data to optimize. That’s how these three companies are seeing 100%+ <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-make-money-on-amazon/">growth in revenue coming from their Amazon channel</a>, plus extra time and money to spend on acquiring new audiences for their independent webstore.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>It’s isn’t a no-sum game. In fact, it’s a winner takes all –– and the winner is the retailer. The winner is you.</strong></p>

Recipients struggle with crowbars and hammers –– working tirelessly, often having to call in help in order to pry open the wooden box containing beef jerky and nuts.</p>
<p class="p1">Beads of sweat drip down their face, the Man Crates customer –– likely the man’s “supposed” friend, family member or partner –– giggling like a middle-schooler in the background.</p>
<p><center><iframe width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mV0abDpTJ4A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p class="p1">Back at Man Crates HQ, a similar feat of superhuman capabilities is afoot.</p>
<p class="p1">In less than four years, a small San Francisco group of friends grew their quirky business idea –– near impossible to open gift boxes –– <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/man-crates/">4,900% to $21 million in annual revenue</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Like the secret to opening the box itself, success is found in how you leverage the hook.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Growth Hacking Cryptonite</h2>
<p class="p1">The Man Crates team is no stranger to hard work. Hell, they built a box that’ll wear out the strongest among us both physically and mentally.</p>
<p class="p1">Four years ago, they were a team of four in a garage. Today, they are a team of 49 in a warehouse in one of the most expensive locales by square footage in North America.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>That kind of trajectory isn’t accidental. It doesn’t happen on the first try. It takes a tool.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">And while men with crowbars make for a high-engagement photo on social media, the tool Man Crates used to build their business to the <a href="http://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2016" target="_blank">4th fastest growing retailer in the U.S.</a> is one impossible to see with the naked eye: <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/ecommerce-api/">APIs and webhooks</a>.</p>

<h3 class="p4">What is an API?</h3>
<p class="p1">APIs, for the unfamiliar, are connection endpoints for various software. They are what make everything you use on the web work together. It’s how you get an email from Facebook to your Google account saying you received a new notification. It’s how you can checkout via Square or PayPal when you’re shopping at any online store.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>APIs make the modern web function –– and you use them everyday.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">But, you use common ones. You use ones that have been connected to serve a particular purpose, one often derived by the business which created the API itself.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Facebook’s API talks to Google. There was a wide-spread use case and business need for that. <em><strong>What’s being solved here:</strong> </em>Ensuring that the two most popular methods of web communication help users keep track of their interactions.</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/square" target="_blank">Square</a> or PayPal’s API talks to online stores. There was a wide-spread use case and business need for that. <em><strong>What’s being solved here:</strong></em> Ensuring that customers can checkout using the services they are most familiar with, and that inventory and payment will go back to the correct store owner. Also, this solves for store owners having to build their own, unique point of sale system.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In 2012, as Man Crates began pulling in their first orders, they too took advantage of common ecommerce APIs. To our BigCommerce customers, these are commonly referred to as apps or integrations. BigCommerce alone offers more than 300 of these <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/" target="_blank">apps that integrate with an ecommerce store</a> to simplify processes and facilitate streamlined communication between different parts of a business.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17182" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-1.jpg" alt="Ecommerce Installation" width="750" height="479" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-1.jpg 768w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-1-300x191.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-1-750x479.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Using easy to edit templates, built-in shipping provider integrations and inventory management, and increasing customer loyalty and AOV through abandoned cart emails, the Man Crates team was set for year one –– and presumably into the future had the business not taken off as it had.</p>
<p class="p1">But Man Crates was growing at an unprecedented scale for their niche and soon, the team needed something much more complex than one-click installations –– something more specific to their unique business needs.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s when they began building upon their installation of BigCommerce –– creating what they would soon call “the Octopus.”</p>
<h2 class="p3">Always on the Move, Never Staying Put</h2>
<p class="p1">It started with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/shipworks/" target="_blank">Shipworks</a>, a shipping integration that offers shipping provider discounts, easy printing of labels, importing of all orders across all channels to a centralized backend and automated shipping tasks, just to name a few of its functionalities.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a key integration, and a pre-existing one on the BigCommerce backend. Man Crates installed it relatively early on in the company’s life. From there, they began to save money on shipping rates –– and save time by eliminating the need for manual functions.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17183" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-2.jpg" alt="Ecommerce Applications and Integrations" width="750" height="502" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-2.jpg 768w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-2-750x502.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Suddenly, they were getting orders out faster and more accurately. Customers were reaping the benefits of a single API solution, that allowed the team more time to focus on front end activities.</p>
<p class="p1">And yet, off-line, back in that garage they started in, the walls were closing in on them.</p>
<p><center><img class="alignnone wp-image-17181" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-garage.png" alt="Man Crates Garage Picture" width="589" height="331" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-garage.png 589w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-garage-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></center></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>They had too many boxes, and too few people.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">It was time to move spaces –– and bring their two-pronged backend solution with them. It was only the first of four moves they’d make over the course of their four years in business to date.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Read that again: It was the first of four moves they’d make –– one each year.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">That’s akin to moving to a new house every year. The packing and boxing. The unpacking and unboxing. The organizing and reorganizing. The trying to figure out just exactly where you put that extra pair of scissors –– this drawer … or that.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s an agonizing process –– but a necessary one. A business needs space in which to function, after all.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, the only thing more crucial than having the appropriate square footage in which to operate your business is actually ensuring your business can run while you move.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;That was a huge time sink,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsamgong" target="_blank">Sam Gong</a>, co-founder of Man Crates. “It was amazing not to have to worry about our storefront during all of those other changes to the business. Having an extensible platform that allowed us to easily customize our fulfillment strategy to best serve our customers from multiple warehouses was amazing.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="p1">Did you catch that? Beyond moving actual warehouses, Man Crates was opening up additional distribution centers –– and they needed to make sure that when a customer placed an order, the information was going to the correct center to account for the cheapest and speediest shipping.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s where things got tricky.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Ecommerce APIs: The Secret to Unseen Innovation, Can’t-Miss Revenue</h2>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Once we got to the point where we were really doing complicated things, on-demand manufacturing and managing inventory across multiple locations –– then we tapped into the API,” says Gong.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“We wrote small applications that just took notifications from BigCommerce and downloaded the data order by order then routed it one-by-one to the systems it needed to go to.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">This is what makes up the whole of Man Crates’ API octopus. It’s a system, centralized by activity on their website, which takes consumer behavior (like conversion), turns it into data and spits it out to the right software programs.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17184" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-3.jpg" alt="Ecommerce API" width="750" height="600" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-3.jpg 768w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-3-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-3-750x600.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">For instance, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/quickbooks" target="_blank">a QuickBooks integration</a> takes all of their sales information and spits it into already formatted accounting sheets for business review and tax purposes. And, the API is set up to make this happen at whatever cadence the team decides is best (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly).</p>
<p class="p1">That’s a simple API –– but an important one. Another equally important one, and much more difficult to solve for, is customer satisfaction via on-site experience and personalization.</p>
<p class="p1">See, as the brand was growing, they realized the need for customized items. After all, it was gifts they were shipping. And gifts, by their nature, are personalized.</p>
<p class="p1">So, they launched on-demand manufacturing capabilities for personalized boxes. Now, not only did they need shipping details to pull from the correct warehouses and distribution centers –– they needed the customized order to pull the correct items for the correct boxes and then land those boxes in the correct center for the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">quickest and cheapest shipping options.</a></p>
<p class="p1">And they needed the algorithm to show those options to the customer in real-time while they were about to hit “purchase” on the site.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Because if they didn’t, Man Crates would have turned from a gift box producer and seller into a custom order machine. They would need to hire customer service reps to take on custom orders and route those orders to the appropriate places –– using calculations (hopefully up to date!) to tell a customer exactly how much their desired gift would cost –– shipping and tax included.</p>
<p class="p1">Few businesses have time for that –– and Man Crates definitely did not.</p>
<p class="p1">Between moving warehouses and opening distribution centers, Man Crates continued to focus on understanding what makes a great gift and how to build a brand that conveys value. Copywriting is a crucial part of how they reach their audience.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>And you simply can’t outsource good copy.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I ran across a recent article about <a href="https://medium.com/@janessalantz/barbells-vs-treadmills-a-fresh-take-on-content-strategy-aef8bbd19578#.se1db3b5c" target="_blank">content marketing on Medium</a>. It nailed this idea in the best phrasing of words I’ve come across yet:</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>You cannot outsource your thinking.</strong> Many times while working through a presentation or blog post, you’ll find that you’re developing new thoughts and adding clarity to the thoughts that have been bouncing around in your brain. This happens because you have a deep understanding of your product, market, and customer. People that lack that deep, strategic understanding of your business simply can’t do this. And really, it’s unfair to expect that a content marketer (or anyone for that matter) should do your thinking for you.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Man Crates knows this to be true –– and all you have to do is take a look at their website to know it.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17180" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-website.png" alt="Man Crates Website" width="750" height="448" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-website.png 863w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-website-300x179.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-website-750x448.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Their copy is genuinely funny. It’s engaging. It’s light-hearted. And most of all, it speaks directly to its customer: friends, family members and partners of self-described “manly men” who are difficult to buy gifts for.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s a pun in there somewhere –– I can’t think of it. But the Man Crates team could. That’s where they have spent most of their money. On understanding their customer, nailing their branding and then making top-notch marketing to really drive it all home.</p>
<p class="p1">That said, with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/man-creates-customer-experience/">brand building as a top priority</a>,<strong> the Man Crates team couldn’t have scaled with a manual approach to increasingly complex operational needs.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The octopus –– which they fondly call the “order-pus” –– solves most of those needs for them.</p>
<h2 class="p3">AI Looks More Like Automation Than Robotics</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17185" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-4.jpg" alt="Ecommerce Enterprise API" width="750" height="600" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-4.jpg 768w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-4-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-crates-bigcommerce-API-4-750x600.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Today, with 49 full time employees, the Man Crates team has integrated everything from a custom built content marketing platform to various manufacturing automation tools into the backend. It all works seamlessly, sending notifications to the right places at the right times so that employees can focus on getting the job done rather than figuring out algorithmic complexities.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“We don’t expect our ecommerce backend to solve all of these really unique problems that we have as product. It can&#8217;t be all things to all people. It would be crazy for it to try,” says Gong.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“It has just a really robust API and reliable webhooks, and that gives us the flexibility to do whatever we need on top of the platform.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">This has been the secret sauce to Man Crates’ success. This has been their strategic advantage. This has been how they’ve executed on a lean business model and made $21M in revenue before their 5th birthday.</p>
<p class="p1">And while customers and recipients from The Today Show and The View to family gatherings at Christmas and Bachelor parties in Vegas continue to struggle –– the team behind the scenes rests easy.</p>
<p class="p1">Not much will crack this box.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-5.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-5.jpg 1000w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-5-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="p1">After competing in water polo for three consecutive Olympic games (12 years in all), Wolf Wigo was done. Competing at that level for so long, while it certainly has its physical benefits, can seriously set an Olympian back in terms of their post-athletic career.</p>
<p class="p1">Water polo players don’t get the sponsorships often awarded to Michael Phelps or Usain Bolt. Scale it back even to a national view, and water polo can’t hold a candle to the financial benefits of soccer or basketball stardom.</p>
<p class="p1">Wigo’s best option, at 31, was to jump into the coaching scene –– where so many of his fellow water polo competitors had landed.</p>
<p class="p1">He quickly got a job as head coach for the men’s team at UC Santa Barbara, which led to Director of Water Polo. It’s a position he still holds.</p>
<p class="p1">But an old friend and player from back home on the East Coast –– a rare hometown locale for a sport popular primarily in California –– had an interesting take on the duo’s potential next steps.</p>
<p class="p1">For Brad Schumacher, it’d been four years since he competed at the 2000 Olympics, choosing that round in Sydney to compete in water polo rather than relay (though he had qualified for both). After all, he’d won two gold medals –– one in 4&#215;100 freestyle relay and the other in 4&#215;200 freestyle relay ––  four years before in Atlanta, and it’s not uncommon for swimmers to turn water polo players after years of swimming in their own lane, so to speak.</p>
<p class="p1">Then again, Schumacher wasn’t just a former swimmer turned water polo player. He was the first world champion athlete in both sports since 1904. He, unlike anyone else, knew the ins and outs of the two sports –– the needs, the requirements and mostly, all of the competitors.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, watching the 2004 Water Polo Olympics, his eye caught the brand supplying the caps. Unlike in swimming, where multiple brands have a share of the market, Schumacher quickly assessed the water polo situation: no one else was competing.</p>
<p class="p1">When the games ended, he called up his old friend –– one of the only other players he knew from the East Coast –– and laid down a little, somewhat familiar, proposition.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>“What if we began competing?”</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">How Olympians –– Fail To –– Make Money</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17086" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-7.jpg" alt="Kap 7" width="750" height="483" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-7.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-7-300x193.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">It’s really hard to make money as an Olympian. Unless your name is Michael Phelps or Simone Biles, you’re pretty much stuck raising money for your trip and working full or part time –– practicing on your off hours.</p>
<p class="p1">Yes, even if you win gold. In fact, athletes have to pay Uncle Sam <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2016/08/15/olympics-victory-tax-gold-medal/88587636/">nearly $10,000</a> for each medal won.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, being an Olympian in a minor sport is a lot like the early days of entrepreneurship. It’s a lot of extra hours during your downtime, using money you’re making during your 9 to 5 to fund a dream that may or may not pay off, but that certainly has an air of “well worth it” no matter the outcome.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a tale of endurance and focus, long-term strategy and superb management skills –– both in terms of money and time.</p>
<p class="p1">The story sounds grand. A career match made in heaven. Olympians often have the prestige and the audience, and a startup’s success hinges on the skills on which these athletes have become some of the best contenders in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">From a spectator’s viewpoint, there’s nothing stopping their success, few barriers that could ever stand in their way.</p>
<p class="p1">Yet, in 2004, when Wolf Wigo and Brad Schumacher launched their new water polo gear company –– <a href="http://www.kap7.com/">Kap7</a> –– on the heels of Wigo’s last Olympic show and 8 years after Schumacher won two gold medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, success wasn’t exactly a straight shot away.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, there was quite a bit potentially stopping their success, more barriers than they had originally foreseen.</p>
<p class="p1">The first, of which, was that their biggest –– albeit only –– competitor was a legacy brand in a niche space. It was a brand they had grown up with, whose products served as the means to the end of their Olympic dreams.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>But that brand was suffering under its own success.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">“That company owned market share worldwide , and they still have a stronghold,” says Alex Young, Kap7’s General Manager and a competitive water polo player himself. “When you have that, you look for any way to increase margins, and that’s what they did. This is where Brad and Wolf saw a huge opportunity”</p>
<p class="p1">Ever the competitors, water polo Olympians Wigo and Schumacher took on the challenge: create a higher quality product –– after all, who would know the quality needed better than Olympic players themselves? –– and force the entire market to level-up.</p>
<p class="p1">To do so, they started with the crux of the game: the ball.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The Competition Heats Up</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17085" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-8.jpg" alt="water polo" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-8.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-8-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">As Olympic athletes, Wigo and Schumacher are no strangers to perfection. They’d been practicing their own form for decades. They’d been teaching form to up-and-coming players for years. To them, there is no such thing as MVP (minimal viable product) –– a product launch strategy so often used in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="p1">No, the duo went straight for the jugular in out-competing their competitor.</p>
<p class="p1">First, they addressed ball quality –– a rather easy feat. After all, with a near monopoly on the market, their biggest competition had jacked up prices on lower quality goods. Kap7 could then maintain those price points, take a cut on margin, and source a better crafted ball. They found higher quality rubber and implemented a better production process.</p>
<p class="p1">In terms of form, their ball was perfect.</p>
<p class="p1">Next, they addressed function, using a longer buffing process to add grip to the ball, improving actual performance.</p>
<p class="p1">“If you look at a water polo ball, they have these little grooves in them that allow you to grip the ball,” says Young.  “The buffing process allows more of the fibers of the rubber to come out, so the ball is more grippy.”</p>
<p class="p1">Wigo’s own players at UC Santa Barbara were among the first beta testers.</p>
<p class="p1">“Toward the end of the practice,” says Young, “players were clamoring over getting the Kap7  ball because the composition of it is so much better.”</p>
<p class="p1">All right –– so they had the players on their side and Wigo and Schumacher were satisfied with the final product. In terms of form and function, it blew the competitor out of the water. Now, all they had to do was get the ball in line sight of coaches throughout the country –– and begin to sell and produce profit.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s when their competitor’s biggest leg up nearly drowned them.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The Governing Bodies of Water Polo</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17087" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-10.jpg" alt="water polo team" width="750" height="498" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-10.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-10-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">It’s the reality for nearly all great things in this world. Rules and regulations are applied in order to keep the playing field level and fair, in order to establish rule and order out of chaos.</p>
<p class="p1">Regulations, in fact, are what brought us out of nature. They became those establishments by which we formed communities and safer environments –– what we’d eventually call our culture and society.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, anyone familiar with rules and regulations knows one thing to be absolutely certain: they aren’t unbiased.</p>
<p class="p1">Humans write these rules and regulations –– and humans are often suaded, even in the earliest of days, by tradeable goods. Today, we call that bargaining chip “money.”</p>
<p class="p1">Even in water polo, dollar bills often get the final say.</p>
<p class="p1">In order to sell water polo product and gear, the governing bodies of the industry require you to become a sponsored entity –– and there are only two ways to do so.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>You pay out. </strong></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>You grassroots the thing.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Instead of bulldozing their way into the sport by purchasing large flashy sponsorship deals, Wigo and Schumacher decided to infiltrate the market through grassroots methods.</p>
<p class="p1">“We made sure we had a higher quality product,” says Young. “Everyone in the company is  part of the sport and we know the coaches really well, so we would see them on the pool deck, and give them product to use and test to give us feedback.”</p>
<p class="p1">Between Wigo, Schumacher and Young, Kap7 knows roughly 80% of the coaches and players in the game in the U.S. Instead of shelling out for a superficial sponsorship win, the three went heads down on winning gold the good ol’ fashioned way: perseverance and dominance.</p>
<p class="p1">They began packing up. It was time to get face-to-face with their desired customers, on a road trip of sorts to coach’s conference and clinics across the country.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Winning the Admiration of Adolescent Players</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17082" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-4.jpg" alt="Kap 7 water polo ball" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-4.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Two Olympic water polo players have a lot to offer coaches beyond a new ball. Their names can bring in new talent and fill up the roster for camps. Better yet, their drills and experience can inspire as well as truly train the next generation of Olympic players.</p>
<p class="p1">Kap7’s roadtrip to meet coaches and show up at clinics turned into a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p class="p1">“We told coaches, ‘Hey, we&#8217;re going to do these clinics to help you and your team, get better, which in turn allows more opportunities for kids to go to college. We&#8217;re going to make sure you have these functional training products, and you&#8217;re going to have really good customer service. We&#8217;re going to make sure you get all the information you need on how to use them, follow up with you, making sure you are successful.’”</p>
<p class="p1">That’s how Kap7 earned their spot as the official high school water polo ball for schools as well as associations for that age range. To date, their high school equipment sector is still the largest driver of growth for the company –– which has allowed the team to expand their offering, finally giving Kap7 the leg up on the competitor, and solidifying their share of the market.</p>

<p class="p1">“We&#8217;re unique in the market because the Kap7 brand is flagshipped by the water polo ball, and  we also have all of the exclusive rights to Spanish swimwear brand, Turbo. We&#8217;re really the only full-service water polo company that can offer you all products. If it&#8217;s something we don&#8217;t carry, we make sure we distribute it.”</p>
<p class="p1">That expansion into customized swimwear, Kap7’s other speciality outside of the water polo ball, wasn’t random. High school teams are rambunctious, creative and spirited –– and they often want their own version of swimwear unique to their team.</p>
<p class="p1">“It&#8217;s the funniest thing, because [the kids will] buy eight at a time,” says Young. “I&#8217;ve probably had four in my life, maybe five, and I work for the company that makes them. It&#8217;s hilarious to me to see that. The different sections of our business are driven by the different customers, but that&#8217;s what makes it interesting.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s probably the more fun side of the business, too, because we can make a print, like these Rio, Brazil Olympics prints. Our top seller though, is the jean print. Parents hate it, but the kids are like, ‘Oh, it&#8217;s so cool. It looks like denim!’”</p>
<p class="p1">Printed swimwear is now one of Kap7’s most profitable markets. So much so, they partnered with the Spanish swimwear brand Turbo to exclusively distribute suits in North and South America –– expanding their product offering beyond the Kap7 ball.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Breaking the Glass Ceiling of a Niche Segment</h2>

<p class="p1">It’s been a more than a decade since Wigo or Schumacher competed in the Olympics. They’ve spent all those subsequent years still dedicated to the sport, but growing their skills not in the pool, but on the sidelines, next to the coaches and training the players.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s won them both high school and NCAA sponsorship status. The latter coming only five years ago –– and providing an even more intimate level of product critique. After all, the collegiate level in the highest you can go in the U.S. Those college kids and their coaches are the elite of the sport –– outside of the Olympics, at least.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__callout post-detail__callout--left"><h3>400% Growth by Switching to BigCommerce </h3></p>
<p class="p1">Find out how Kap7 grew their business 400% after moving their online store to BigCommerce. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/kap7/">Read the case study</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<p class="p1">It’s why the Kap7 team has begun to look internationally for expansion. Europe has multiple professional leagues, for instance. But, like here in the U.S., it’s the close knit community that wins fans –– and Wigo and Schumacher are much less connected in that arena.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, they only launched a functional ecommerce site a few years ago. Before that, they had a site, but orders had to be called in. The process worked well for a custom order base –– as coaches called in to make order placements for their teams. Expanding to a B2C base has helped the bottom line –– and it’s also given them the power of the internet, an already international medium.</p>
<p class="p1">“[High school and college kids in the U.S.] constantly want more and more content, someone to talk to, skills to learn, and how they can get better at the sport,” says Young. “That&#8217;s really why we have the Drills &amp; Tips page. In turn, it keeps the traffic on our page. We want to be the go-to water polo website.”</p>
<p class="p1">The company has turned its focus on becoming a water polo content powerhouse, using Wigo and Schumacher not just at clinics and in-person, but on video and YouTube in order to drive growth no matter location. In many ways, it&#8217;s the same strategy which earned Kap7 their success today –– a grassroots movement powered by recommendations, perseverance and dominance.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s about listening to your customers –– the same way an Olympian listens to his or her body in order to excel.</p>
<h2 class="p3">An Olympic Launch into International Waters</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17088" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo9.jpg" alt="Kap7 international expansion" width="750" height="428" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo9.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kap7-water-polo9-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Of course, international expansion has been made easier for Kap7/Turbo USA this year with the Olympics. Turbo USA secured the sponsorship as the Official Competition Gear Supplier for the United States Mens and Womens Olympic Water Polo Team. Notably, of the 24 water polo teams competing in the Rio Olympics, 9 are competing in Turbo.</p>
<p class="p1">For Wigo, Schumacher and Young, though, the excitement around Rio and 2016 games is about more than just winning the official sponsorship. After all, they personally know everyone competing for the U.S. They’ve supplied their gear for the better part of a decade. They’ve seen them grow. They’ve trained with them. They’ve played with them. They are part of the larger water polo community –– in the tightest knit way.</p>
<p class="p1">“All of the models on our website are competing in the 2016 Rio Olympics”. John Mann is one of those. He&#8217;s 31. He&#8217;s going to commit for another four years. You really put off your career to commit to a dream. It&#8217;s very humbling to put off your life and career to chase a dream.”</p>
<p class="p1">Then again, 31 is exactly when Wigo and Schumacher turned their Olympic focus and love of competition toward a business idea, bringing water polo dollars back to water polo players and proving once and again that with enough perseverance, the Davids of the world can take down any Goliath.</p>

<p class="p1">Want to hear directly from the founders of Nine Line on how they became of the top, fastest growing retailers in the U.S.? Then it&#8217;s your lucky day!  Us, too! Tyler will be speaking and dishing tips tips and tactics at BigCommerce&#8217;s first annual Ecommerce Growth Summit, featuring keynote presentations from Tyler as well as Mike Ditka, NFL Hall of Fame Coach, and Jason Boyce, Co-Founder and CEO of Dazadi.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://grow.bigcommerce.com/summit">Register for the Ecommerce Growth Summit in Chicago this June.</a> Hope to see you there!</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">The year was 2012. Tyler Merritt was deployed for a special aviation regiment. Back home in Georgia, his wife, Angela, was preparing another macaroni and cheese meal for four –– as she had been for nearly two years.</p>
<p class="p1">Tyler might not be there to partake with their two kids, but his brother was. Daniel Merritt had moved in recently, and was calling the couch home.</p>
<p class="p1">After dinner, Angela and Daniel got back to packing and shipping boxes of product out to military units –– both deployed and at home. Special as Tyler’s own mission may have been, his family half a world away was working through complicated, classified information.</p>
<p class="p1">The only thing protecting them from jail, <em>albeit treason</em>, was a password protected website.</p>
<p class="p1">Tyler and family weren’t running a Silk Road operation, though. Edward Snowden nor any type of Wikileak were ever involved. Emails were certainly a communication channel –– but none of them were required to keep those on a private server.</p>
<p class="p1">No, Tyler, Daniel and Angela were providing a rare service to military members, one so often taken for granted by civilians: the production of affordable, quality, custom t-shirts.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“One of the trials and tribulations of military organizations, especially ones like mine, is a lot of the time you can&#8217;t put things on t-shirts and have other people make it,” Tyler tells me. “Some of our original websites were password protected because when you put a name of an operation, name of an organization, the dates, or who&#8217;s involved –– it kind of becomes classified.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">The classified nature of custom t-shirts for individual units made the sourcing of them difficult. But, like any of us ever part of a team, t-shirts often serve as a uniting force –– a tangible memory of the time and dedication we put into an activity we loved.</p>
<p class="p1">We wear them at college football games, even when those schools becomes our Alma Maters. High school sports teams have dozens of designs from which players and families can choose –– a couple for practice, a few for game day, and some just for the pep rallies.</p>
<p class="p1">Mob mentality? Maybe. T-shirts provide a visual queue as to who is on our team. Those in other colors or designs aren’t necessarily our enemies, but they haven’t walked the same footing. They haven’t lived through the same struggles. Their pride doesn’t stem from the same place.</p>
<p class="p1">Yet, for military members, the creation such shirts was just out of reach.</p>
<p class="p1">The small number needed pushed prices up, even for a single color. The commentary units often wanted included often meant anyone outside the organization shouldn’t have access. To address both of those concerns, low quality shirts were printed. After all, they were cheaper and wouldn’t last as long.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>This was a non-starter for Tyler.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">These men and women were heroes. They had risked the ultimate sacrifice. They needed shirts and apparel that represented them –– and didn’t cost an outrageous amount. He quickly researched online alternatives and decided he could create a better shirt, for much less, than anything on the market.</p>
<p class="p1">He was right –– but the demand quickly outpaced his family’s production capabilities. His brother was sleeping in the living room. The garage was overflowing with shirts. Money was tight –– and he was running out of both storage and sleeping space.</p>
<p class="p1">Back from deployment, Tyler knew he needed to find <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-solutions/">a more permanent solution</a> for his family’s business –– and then double down on all their success. Or –– more accurately –– quadruple down and lead the team on a path to more than $10,000,000.</p>
<p class="p1">Little did Tyler know then, though, how riddled that path would be. IEDs, police raids and much more mac and cheese lay ahead.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Nine Line Medevac Request –– a Call for Help</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17023" title="Nine Line Medevac" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-medevac.jpg" alt="nine-line-medevac" width="750" height="300" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-medevac.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-medevac-300x120.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Back in the Middle East, Daniel was down. He was on the ground. He’d been hit with an IED.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>A nine line was called.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Tyler was manning the plane.</p>
<p class="p1">One of Tyler’s main missions during deployment was to fly personnel out of hostile environments –– he just hadn’t expected one of those missions would be for his brother. Then again, all of those missions were for his brothers, figuratively at least. And he often saw the worst of it.</p>
<p class="p1">Forty-pound IEDs could blow legs off of soldiers. So could improvised explosive devices. Amputations, traumatic brain injuries and extensive burns were commonplace situations for Tyler. His mission: get those injured to help as quickly and calmly as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">A nine line is a soldier&#8217;s last chance, a final call for help in the case of a potentially tragic turn of events. Those in the military know the term well. It’s a unifying one. Someone was inches in theory from paying the ultimate sacrifice. A nine line brings them back from the cliffs of death.</p>
<p class="p1">It was Daniel who later suggested they name the <a href="http://www.ninelineapparel.com/">new t-shirt brand</a> after this revered term. The two decided that it was time the civilian world became as familiar with it as those who serve to protect them.</p>
<p class="p1">They even launched the <a href="http://ninelinefoundation.org/">Nine Line Foundation</a> in coordination with the brand. The foundation&#8217;s purpose is to raise funds for wounded veterans with concerted efforts that produce tangible results.</p>
<p class="p1">You need tens of thousands of dollars to affect real change in veterans’ lives, not just $10 or $50 here or there. Neither Tyler nor Daniel were about to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-start-online-business/">start a business</a> built on the courage of those who’ve served and not give back. So, in their spare time, Nine Line Foundation has hosted at least 10 different initiatives to help fund efforts aiding wounded veterans, including hikes, walks, 5Ks, 10Ks, t-shirt fundraisers and individual-specific campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">They’ve even partnered with Alaskan Healing, a wounded veteran-led reality TV show based on the coast of Alaska, focusing on “exploring the power of nature to heal the soul and the ability of motivated Vet fueled teams to compete to win.”</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unwQA7eNcts" width="750" height="422" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">It’s a pretty emotional video –– a testament to willpower, family and community alike. It’s the exact emotional tie Tyler and Daniel wanted customers to feel for Nine Line. And now, with a name, a production space, and a steady stream of cash flow from their custom-made operations, these former military-men turned business entrepreneurs were facing their next challenge: branding.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Increased Devotion and The Birth of a Brand</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17024" title="Nine Line Branding" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-brand.jpg" alt="nine-line-brand" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-brand.jpg 1800w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-brand-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-brand-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Myles Burke sits quietly on the line while I pepper Tyler with questions about the beginning days of Nine Line. He’s the one who set up the call, having entered <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/designawards">BigCommerce’s Design Awards</a>, and receiving finalist status, a couple months earlier.</p>
<p class="p1">Tyler is now based in New York City, working on elevating the brand’s visibility to the big shots there. Daniel, on the other hand, is running the shop in Savannah, Georgia in Tyler’s physical absence.</p>
<p class="p1">Well, Daniel –– and Myles.</p>
<p class="p1">Tyler and Myles met at Nine Line’s turning point. Tyler was beginning to reach out to design studios, looking for people to help bring his ideas to life and get supportive military shirts on the market.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“We were shifting our focus to create designs that were iconic to what we represent. That is, we like to promote patriotism,” says Tyler. “We believe in certain things that might be considered controversial. We don&#8217;t think they should be. Respecting the American flag and what it stands for. You know, you can not agree with public policy, but to service members and other individuals, [the flag] represents something that&#8217;s sacred. That&#8217;s our personal opinion.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">Elsewhere in Savannah, Myles was graduating from college and beginning a freelance graphic design career. That’s how the two met, setting meetings up at Hot Wings restaurants to discuss new custom projects. Soon, Myles was helping Tyler to build out Nine Line’s branding and first website.</p>
<p class="p1">Tyler was impressed with his work and Myles quickly became Nine Line’s first hire. Today, Myles is much more than simply a graphic designer. He sits in on every interview for potential new employees, ensuring that the company culture stays intact and all hires bring a sense of both patriotism and innovation to the mix. He’s the protector of the brand –– as well as the visual creator of it –– and he forges his battles both internally and out.</p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, he is just as dedicated to the cause as Tyler and Daniel themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">So, the team was growing and everyone was finding their niche. Sales were on the up and up. Custom orders were steady for one side of the business, and, thanks to Myles’ designs and website branding, civilian orders for the Nine Line original shirts were skyrocketing.</p>
<p class="p1">The small house Tyler had bought for production was perfect. Shipments from manufacturers were coming in. Nine Line orders were going out. The business was on the up-and-up. They had the people. They had the space.</p>
<p class="p1">And then the police kicked down the door.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Fighter Pilots Raided by Police</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17025" title="Nine Line Police Raid" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-police-raid.jpg" alt="nine-line-police-raid" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-police-raid.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-police-raid-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">It was a nefarious situation from the outside looking in. Packages were coming and going from a small neighborhood home that had been bought in foreclosure only a year earlier. No one had moved in, but plenty of people were often there –– at all hours of the day.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“We had packages coming and going everyday,” says Tyler. “I&#8217;d get off work from the Army. I&#8217;d come back to the house. I&#8217;d work all night, fill up my truck, and try to speed to the post office before it close.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">It was like a scene out of Breaking Bad. Successful drug operations, after all, are often discreet. They happen in neighborhood homes and basements as much as they might in more secluded arenas. The cops know this –– and they keep an eye out for the tell-tale signs.</p>
<p class="p1">All of which Nine Line’s production facility –– AKA a residential home with hundreds of incoming and outgoing packages per day –– possessed.</p>
<p class="p1">What the local authorities found in that house might not have been drugs, but it did end Tyler and team in cop cars and at the Savannah Police Department headquarters. In fact, Tyler and his special operations unit now ride along with the SWAT team on raids in downtown Savannah and they’ve invested plenty of volunteer hours in teaching the local teams how to plan and better coordinate their efforts.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“There&#8217;s not a more supportive city for veteran entrepreneurship than Savannah for what they&#8217;re been able to do with us,” says Tyler.</em></p>
<p class="p1">The raid did have its repercussions, though. Nine Line needed to find a bigger production facility –– a real one. They’re now working out of two buildings and multiple trailers on President’s Street near downtown Savannah, with current facilities totaling more than 20,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“We just acquired 380 acres of land in Savannah and we are building a 50,000 square foot warehouse, starting next month,” says Tyler.</em></p>
<h2 class="p3">All Goods, Created Equal</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17026" title="Nine Line Production" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-employees.png" alt="nine-line-factory" width="750" height="273" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-employees.png 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-employees-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Those 50,000 square feet won’t just be for inventory. Tyler plans on using the extra room to create Nine Line’s own textile factory –– and produce all the goods in-house, from scratch.</p>
<p class="p1">See, Nine Line nailed their <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-branding/">branding and mission</a> –– working hard to find a niche and loyal audience. For some brands, that process is decades in the making. Tyler and team did it in less than four years.</p>
<p class="p1">But Tyler’s eye is still his original prize: high-quality, affordable goods produced right here in the U.S.</p>
<p class="p1">Right now, Nine Line sells 14,000 individual products and variants. The key to a cost-effective business model, the way Tyler sees it, is <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/inventory-management/">keeping inventory as low as feasibly possible</a>. This opens up more room for other ideas and business strategy executions.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“The problem about going domestic is because of the volume that we&#8217;re dealing with. Not everyone can produce at the range we need, and I don&#8217;t have the space to make massive bulk purchases,” says Tyler, talking about why he plans to build out his own textile facility. “The system that we have built on the backend of BigCommerce is pretty complicated to allow for us to have an inventory that really is only a few weeks old –– and still be able to produce the same amount of volume in sales. The open API has been very helpful.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">Now, it isn’t just the production that Tyler is wanting to keep local.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Created By Us, For Us</h2>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17022" title="Nine Line Employees" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-employees.jpg" alt="nine-line-employees" width="750" height="750" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-employees.jpg 750w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-employees-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nine-line-employees-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p class="p1">About 50% of the employees who work at Nine Line are veterans, and almost all of them have little to no experience in ecommerce.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“For us, it&#8217;s not about your past experience. It&#8217;s about what your desire is,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/myles-burke-1b320152?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=mXFs&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=414245601470416340061&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=2&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A414245601470416340061%2CVSRPtargetId%3A185630679%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary%2CVSRPnm%3Atrue%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH">Myles</a>. “‘Why do you want to join in on the ground floor? Do you have a lot of good ideas? Are you going to treat this job like a clock in, clock out, or are you going to come in and give 100% all the time, make us more innovative?’ We work with some really fantastic employees. Our hiring process is really fun. I enjoy being at interviews and just learning about different people –– what they&#8217;ve done in the past. Our HR specialist is a botanist!”</em></p>
<p class="p1">Tyler has a more strategic approach to Nine Line’s employee type.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“It&#8217;s not normal that our marketing team has no previous marketing experience. Our sales teams, besides one, whom we just hired, has no previous sales experience,” says Tyler. “We get them raw, we give them a skill, and they go out and do incredible things. It&#8217;s more the work ethic and the loyalty to the company. One of our guys who was managing the books up until recently had never done accounting before, and he was taking over for me. They just have an incredible drive to learn and to develop and evolve the company.”</em></p>
<p class="p1">It’s this type of dedication across the entire Nine Line staff that’s made the company the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/clothing-apparel/">fastest growing apparel brand</a> in the U.S. –– growing 391% last year to $9.3 million in sales. They expect to do $15 million this year.</p>
<p class="p1">But how they the heck do they do it?</p>
<p class="p1">Sure, they have smart and dedicated employees, but even brands with 12x the experience in the industry can’t compete with this hockey-stick growth trajectory. For Tyler, the secret is in the software.</p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I like to say BigCommerce is — and I told your CEO this —  BigCommerce is the 99% solution,” says Tyler. “Anything that I need, you guys come in and help out above and beyond. People like Patrick, our account manager, have been invaluable in pointing us in the right direction — either for developers or allowing us to develop it ourselves and to integrate through the API. We have EDI integrations and the platform integrates directly to our ERT system and our point of sale. We’re continuing to develop more unique and organic solutions, too. It’s invaluable.”</em></p>
