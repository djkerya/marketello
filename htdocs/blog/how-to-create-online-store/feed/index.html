		<description><![CDATA[What a great post Katey.  First you used Lolligagin and I thought I was the only one who still used that term.  But more importantly you stressed two things that I think are huge to help people.  


1.  Get moving.  You have to start somewhere.  Create a list and start crossing things off it as you make progress.  There is never a perfect time to start and the best way to get started is to just do it.  Enough of the business plans and procrastination.  Go for it.  


2. Second is that you have to be realistic.  Setting goals is crucial to success but you have to be realistic.  Starting an online store can mean a two to three year horizon before you are making substantial money.  Its tough work.  Its not insurmountable but you have to be realistic.  


Nice post Katey.  Best of luck to everyone starting out.
