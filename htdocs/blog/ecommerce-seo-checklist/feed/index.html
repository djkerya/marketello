		<description><![CDATA[This had great ideas for optimizing eCommerce sites, especially the reminder to add canonical tags for filtered page views. I&#039;ll use that one for my clients for sure. Pagespeed is very important in my opinion, and I&#039;m happy the author wrote about it here (I would have placed it higher, though... just sayin&#039;..)
Talking about having enough content, and giving each page/ item a unique title is important and the author is spot on for emphasizing those aspects. Thanks for the great post, and highly recommended!
