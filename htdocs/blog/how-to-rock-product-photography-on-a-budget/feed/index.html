		<description><![CDATA[Do not let any graphic used on your website become a classic Photoshop fail meme. You can only imagine how “serious” you customers will take you when your site has several images that could make the most hilarious memes. Often these memes are the result of poor clipping path services or other effects.https://goo.gl/gBxm8z
Web sites often contain both visual and text content. While you can often make your own graphics (logos, banner, etc) there are always times when you need to use something made or acquired from a third party. 
The Path to a typical Photoshop Fail
There is a lot of DIY software in use today. Many well meaning people use these products to run or manage their websites. That is fair given graphic and web design can be costly.
What people do not say – rather what you do not get given you are talking to unskilled people is just how hard it can be to perform what appear to be simple graphic design tasks.
Do not attempt DIY software for anything as valuable as your online commerce website. If you have to work alone, take some time to learn about the basics of graphic design or enlist a skilled person to provide you their services for difficult tasks such as clipping path.
Clipping Path Services and Process https://goo.gl/gBxm8z
Above we discussed DIY tools, the problem is not the tools but the designer manipulating the tool.
Clipping is a delicate activity that involves shearing a section of an image for use elsewhere. When done poorly anyone can spot the difference from miles away. This is  because the image you are manipulating is a geometric object. Each photo is in one way or another affected by the background as you look at it in its original form – hence the need for accuracy.
This picture illustrates the primary reason we offer clipping path services to our clients. 
While this could be one of if not your best photo in years, just clipping the person out of the photo is an arduous task. 
The biggest challenge in this case is the hair. If you took a very high quality image it will have plenty of pixel data that you do not want to lose. Just getting the above image will require serious graphic design skill and several layers using very advanced design software. You will most likely require a mask to capture the face and hair on separate layers. You  may need to use the blur tool to make the sections lost less obvious. 
This image of the lovely lady in a bikini is another classic example where both background removal and clipping path services are required.
A closer look will reveal that the job is not quite done yet – there is hologram like text still splattered across the image. Nevertheless, the clipping has been done perfectly leaving all the copies of the lady and bikini (subject of the photo) intact. Our services are useful to avoid copyright issues that could arise as a reseller. Visit our website and enjoy the best in graphic design for your website and success.]]></description>
