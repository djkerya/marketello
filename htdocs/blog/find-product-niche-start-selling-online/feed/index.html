		<description><![CDATA[I think passion and interest is really important.  

Sure - there are some products out there that are self explanatory, but you have to think long term.  If a customer asks a question - would you be able to answer it?  

I thought about selling hair care products because I had an &#039;in&#039;, but I&#039;m lucky to wash my hair once a week.  The products just wouldn&#039;t have been a great fit for me - I wouldn&#039;t have known what to do with half the products and so supporting my customers would have been extremely difficult.  

Also - running/starting your own business will likely be 100 times more work than you think it will be.  Money is a powerful motivator to some, but loving your product, knowing your product, being driven BY the product you sell is very important (to me anyway). When you&#039;re working to 1am AGAIN it helps to like what your doing.

Look to your existing interests.  Love making gluten free brownies?  Bingo - you could make them to sell - develop a mix for sale online or in shops.  

Frustrated at the cost of buying prepackaged school snacks at the supermarket?  Start a website that sells snacks in bulk to reduce costs for mum&#039;s (let me know when it&#039;s up - I&#039;ll place an order).  Chances are if you&#039;re frustrated by it - someone else out there will be too (as shown with the mason jar lids).



The only thing I would say about research is that whilst it&#039;s good to do - it can also be intimidating and hold you back.  Before I started my first store I was told I would never make a $1.  I started an online baby business - it&#039;s a totally saturated market.  There are huge players and hundreds of smaller ones.  If I&#039;d based my decision on &#039;research&#039; then I never would have started.  Within 12 months I sold more baby sleeping bags and swaddles than any other online retailer in Australia (based on suppliers sales).  


Research is interesting, but don&#039;t let it cripple you.  Who cares if there is someone out there that &#039;owns&#039; the market.  It&#039;s a big world - plenty of room for everyone.

Great article by the way. I will be a great resource for those looking to sell online but not knowing where to start.]]></description>
