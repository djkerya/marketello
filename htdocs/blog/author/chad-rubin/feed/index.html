Optimizing it can help you to:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Save money</li>
<li class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">Ship products to customers</a> in a timely manner</li>
<li class="p1">Keep your ecommerce store running as smoothly as possible</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">Inventory ties into every element of your store, from supply, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-warehousing/">to warehousing</a>, to order fulfilment and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p class="p1">But, great inventory management can also increase your sales.</p>
<p class="p1">How? Managing your inventory properly across all of your sales channels helps to lower your product cost and increase shipping speed – ultimately earning you increased customer loyalty and love.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the Amazon model –– and it isn’t out of reach for your business.</p>
<p class="p1">If you scale too quickly without <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/inventory-management-software/">the proper inventory management setup</a>, you may find yourself running out of stock (or having to raise your prices to avoid selling out, resulting in unhappy customers), losing track of your inventory (which warehouse was that in again?), or losing profit margins to inefficient processes.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the most important methods, concepts, and techniques that you can employ right now to ensure that doesn’t happen, and your inventory management solution is an asset not a liability, for your business.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Use Data to Make a Difference</h2>
<p class="p1">Managing inventory creates data, which you can use to streamline processes and improve your inventory and order management.</p>
<p class="p1">If you know how much you sell, when you sell it and hopefully why –– you can use that data to calculate how much stock you should have and when. That way, you can switch to more effective management options, predict sales, and manage your actual stock to create value.</p>
<p class="p1">At <a href="http://www.webretailer.com/lean-commerce/crucial-chad-rubin-amazon/">Think Crucial</a> – my personal ecommerce venture –– we used inventory data to scale a small Amazon store into a multi-channel ecommerce business, driving <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/selling-on-amazon/">$5 million in revenue per year</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">We looked at sales by channel, per period, turn, costs, profit per product, and average product lifespan. The data enabled us to improve inventory management and to forecast sales, which reduced unnecessary stock and cut costs.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21212" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="539" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana.jpg 1283w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana-300x253.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-skubana-750x632.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Like Think Crucial, you can use inventory data to calculate how much stock you need throughout the year.</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Connect with Skubana Now</h3></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">Want to use Skubana to help manage your multi-channel inventory? <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/skubana/">There&#8217;s a one-click app for that</a>.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"></div></p>
<h3 class="p3">Forecast Sales</h3>
<p class="p1">Sales forecasting is a skill that will allow you to use your existing data for future predictions.</p>
<p class="p1">While you can use statistical analysis or a tool for the purpose, simply projecting your current sales data (hopefully 1-5 years) onto a line chart and following the line up at the same rate of increase will allow you to make reasonable predictions.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if you have sold product A for 18 months with an average sales growth of 1.2% per month, you can estimate that you will continue to see that same growth.</p>
<p class="p1">This tells you how much of each product you are likely to sell for any given period, because you can use the previous year&#8217;s sales for that month or week to predict your sales for the coming year.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are a BigCommerce merchant, you can use BigCommerce&#8217;s out-of-the-box analytics to drill down into your individual product or SKU sales over various periods –– and use that to forecast.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s what that looks like on the backend:</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21201" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend.png" alt="" width="640" height="404" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend.png 1165w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-300x189.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-750x473.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21204" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-3.png" alt="" width="640" height="324" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-3.png 1161w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-3-300x152.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-3-750x379.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-5.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21206" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-5.png" alt="" width="640" height="287" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-5.png 1392w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-5-300x134.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-5-750x336.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You’ll likely need to update your forecast model once per quarter –– adjusting based on actual growth versus expected growth to improve future predictions –– which is where the export tool comes in handy.</p>
<p class="p1">Effective forecasting can be thrown off by abnormalities in one sales channel, so the better your grasp on your demand generation, the better you can predict overall trends.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is a view BigCommerce merchants can use to drill down into channel activity:</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21205" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4.png" alt="" width="640" height="328" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4.png 1155w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4-300x154.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-4-750x384.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21202" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="254" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-1.png 1138w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-1-300x119.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-1-750x298.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3">Identify Trends</h3>
<p class="p1">Sales trends include events like holidays, cold and hot weather, and popular opinion that drive sales up or down for one product or another, as well as trends in behavior.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, an ecommerce store specializing in selling teddy bears with hearts could expect to see a rise in sales around Valentine&#8217;s day, but also throughout spring, when couples tend to get engaged or married.</p>
<p class="p1">Identifying your sales trends should be a simple matter of identifying spikes in sales and pinpointing why — then adjusting inventory levels accordingly. If you can identify why sales have gone up, you can decide if that spike is a one-time thing or will happen again next year under the same circumstances.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, a spike in sales for rain boots before a hurricane means that you can probably skip using that trend in forecast data, but the same spike in May, which is typically a rainy month, probably means it&#8217;s a seasonal trend.</p>
<p class="p1">Beyond identifying trends that are driving up sales for inventory management, it’s smart to identify trends beforehand and prepare marketing campaigns to drive even more revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">Here’s a basic calendar for the U.S for 2017. <a href="http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/usa/">You can see other countries here.</a></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21208" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-calendar.png" alt="" width="640" height="390" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-calendar.png 716w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-calendar-300x183.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3 class="p3">Know Your Par Levels</h3>
<p class="p1">Par levels, or Periodic Automatic Replenishment, is the minimum stock you can have on hand when you place a new order.</p>
<p class="p1">Par is basically safety stock, which prevents you from selling out in between orders.</p>
<p class="p1">You can calculate your Par level using:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Lead time</li>
<li class="p1">Sales forecast</li>
<li class="p1">Seasonal demand</li>
<li class="p1">Any back orders you may have</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you don&#8217;t have backorders and you&#8217;ve calculated seasonal demand into your sales forecast, par level is a simple calculation.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Lead Time x Expected Sales Per Period = Safety Stock</em></p>
<p class="p6"><strong>See this in action</strong></p>
<p class="p1">If you sell an average of 10 units per day and have a lead time of 21 days, you must have a minimum stock of 210 units when you place a new order.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>10 x 21 = 210</em></p>
<p class="p2"> However, you should add an additional safety margin.</p>
<p class="p1">You might still need some time to add the new stock to your inventory, the order might be delayed, you might have returns, and you might have an unexpected surge in sales.</p>
<p class="p1">For this reason, you should calculate at least 10% over your minimum safety stock. In this case, 221 units would be enough to ensure that you won&#8217;t sell out under normal conditions.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>210 x .1 = 21</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>210 + 21 = 221</em></p>
<p class="p1">Tools like Skubana allow you to automate this process by setting <a href="https://support.skubana.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003960047-Auto-Reorder-Rules-">automatic reorder points</a> based on par levels, so your inventory never dips below par. These levels are set automatically by the system and changed constantly based on how your items are selling.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21207" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6.png" alt="" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6.png 698w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-6-300x147.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Par levels need to be reported out on a business level, across channels — including Amazon, physical store, and your webstore. Failing to account for one of these can throw off your ability to fulfill and manage orders from any sales channel.</p>
<p class="p1">On BigCommerce, you can see revenue from your various channels, including storefront, Amazon, Instagram, Facebook, eBay, etc. To see orders from those channels and measure Par levels, you’ll need to export your order list.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21203" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="285" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2.png 1136w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2-300x133.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-backend-2-750x333.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3">Keep an Eye on Sales Turns</h3>
<p class="p1">Sales turnover for your industry can help you to better understand how much product you should keep on hand based on the industry.</p>
<p class="p1">If you have access to trade benchmarks for your industry, you can use those.</p>
<p class="p1">Otherwise, <a href="https://www.retailowner.com/Benchmarks">Benchmarks.com</a> offers free industry standards which you can use as a guideline. Simply find the inventory turnover for your industry, and divide the period in a year you want to use by that number.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, let’s look at days, weeks, or months.</p>
<p class="p1">If we were to apply that with the category &#8220;online shopping&#8221; which has an average inventory turnover rate of 5.5, we could calculate that a turn is 2.18 months, 9.45 weeks, or 66 days, which is the maximum inventory supply you should have on hand.</p>
<p class="p1">That is:</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>12 months / 5.5 = 2.18</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>52 weeks / 5.5 = 9.45</em></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>365 days / 5.5 = 66.36 </em></p>
<p class="p1">Once you have calculated your turns, you can use this rate to directly calculate your maximum inventory per period. This rate is simply your calculated sales for the period x the turnover period.</p>
<p class="p1">In most cases, you should not have more than 1 turns worth of inventory on hand at any one time.</p>
<p class="p1">Chances are that you already have the data to perform these calculations.</p>
<h2 class="p6">The Just in Time Inventory Model</h2>
<p class="p1">You can also use these same calculations to integrate new multichannel inventory management models.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, JIT or Just in Time inventory is a model that focuses on reducing costs by stocking the minimum amount to prevent a stock out event.</p>
<p class="p1">This allows you to reduce warehousing volume, take some of the burden off inventory management, and reduce total inventory storage costs.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2011/WCE2011_pp904-908.pdf">Toyota</a> is possibly one of the largest and most notorious companies to implement JIT inventory. Using it, Toyota was able to reduce costs, reduce storage costs, improve lead times, reduce waste, and reduce employee man-hours spent in counting and quality checking stock.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21213" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota.png" alt="" width="640" height="331" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota.png 1452w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/inventory-management-toyota-750x388.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p3">Is Low Inventory Always the Solution?</h3>
<p class="p1">While it can be tempting to think that keeping your inventory as low as possible is the easiest way to save money, you must also consider your supplier or manufacturer.</p>
<p class="p1">Ordering to the manufacturer’s EOQ or Economic Order Quantity allows you to save considerably on product purchase costs. If you order less, you will pay more per product, which may not offset the cost saved in warehousing and inventory management. If your demand is over EOQ, this is likely not a consideration.</p>
<p class="p1">Great inventory is about keeping enough stock on hand to meet customer demand so that you can fulfill quickly, while keeping it low enough to reduce costs and the burden on your warehousing.</p>
<p class="p1">And with customers making purchases from more touchpoints than ever before, you need to have the infrastructure to support multi-channel fulfillment.</p>
<p class="p2">Grant Yuan, President at <a href="https://www.cuttingboard.com/">CuttingBoard LLC</a>, attributes much of his business’s growth to proper inventory management across channels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Prior to inventory management software, we would manually sync our inventory levels each night using spreadsheets. It was tedious work that no one wanted to do.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, once CuttingBoard.com became bigger and we carried more SKUs, we started getting issues with stock outs and overselling product on places and having to cancel shipments.</p>
<p class="p1">It resulted in an extremely poor experience for our customers.</p>
<p class="p1">We realized we needed an automated system to update our inventory on the fly. Luckily, after testing a few systems, we found Skubana and have been with it ever since.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, we use Skubana to pull in our BigCommerce, eBay and Amazon orders into one centralized platform, which saves countless hours versus logging into each system separately.</p>
<p class="p1">I am a firm believer in embracing technology and tools that make our store deliver a superior experience for not just our customers, but my staff using our systems. This one in particular makes me very happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="p3">Understand Actual Profits</h2>
<p class="p1">While great inventory management can help you to reduce total costs, it can also help you to understand them so that you better understand your minimum sales points, which will allow you to make better use of repricing automation, marketing, sales and offers, and other tools to streamline sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Real cost of inventory is the total cost of the product, warehousing, delivery, marketing and merchandising.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Freight costs <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Cost of backorders<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Actual cost of inventory<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Interest on money borrowed for inventory <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Inventory damage/loss/theft <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Management costs <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Order management and inventory control</li>
<li class="p1">Dead stock <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Warehousing costs (rent, maintenance, electric, gas, inspections, employees)<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You can calculate warehousing costs by determining how much of your warehouse the product uses, and dividing total costs by that.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if your top selling product is 1/100th of your inventory, 10% of your total warehousing costs belong to that product.</p>
<p class="p1">You can perform similar calculations to estimate freight costs per product. If you receive a shipment with 100 products, you can divide shipping costs based on product volume.</p>
<p class="p1">Your total sales per product minus the total costs of that product is your actual profit per product.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if you have an inventory value of $100,000 for Product A, which will drive $500,000 in total sales, you could use the following example to see an idea of where your money might be going.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21215" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="996" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet.jpg 650w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Inventory-Calculations-Cheatsheet-300x467.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In this example, you are spending 26.8% of total earnings on inventory without considering marketing, merchandising, website costs, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">You can easily perform a full calculation, including items like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Ecommerce software<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Merchandising <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Marketing <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Inventory management software<span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Accounting <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
<li class="p1">Website hosting <span class="s1"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In most cases, your actual profits will go up and down depending on the time of year, market trends, seasonal demand, and other factors.</p>
<p class="p1">You can use your sales forecasts to calculate your total costs for each turn, which will allow you to make better decisions for marketing. Inventory costs are typically between 10 and 40% of total inventory value.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if you know your total costs, you can set better minimum pricing, which will allow you to use automatic repricing. This can help you to maintain the lowest cost product without undercutting yourself, so that you can own Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200401830">buy box buttons</a>, earn features on Walmart, and make Jet.com work for you.</p>
<p class="p1">Taking a step back to understand the whole supply chain can reveal insights you miss while head down in day-to-day operations.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Streamline Multichannel Inventory Management to Improve Customer Satisfaction</h2>
<p class="p1">Inventory management plays a large part in customer satisfaction because it impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Logistics</li>
<li class="p1">Order availability</li>
<li class="p1">Costs</li>
<li class="p1">Delivery times</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For example, some ecommerce businesses attempt to reduce inventory as much as possible by working with drop shipping or by spot ordering, but this reduces your ability to turn fulfill orders so that the customer gets them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">Jason Boyce, co-founder and CEO of Dazadi, understands this well –– and even cut his business off <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-failure-to-success/">from $2,000,000 in revenue</a> in order to increase customer satisfaction for the long run.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“We noticed our performance metrics, on time delivery and order errors were significantly higher with our drop shippers than they were with our own inventory, with our own fulfillment centers. We had to make a drastic change,” says Boyce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">“So, we set out to open additional fulfillment centers and end our drop shipping relationships.  Today, we have four across the country, excluding the stuff we send off to Amazon FBA. Doing this forced us to reduce how many SKUs we offered, but now, we can focus on each individual SKU as an asset and build it up with SEO and customer satisfaction from purchase to delivery.”</p>
<p class="p1">Good inventory management will allow you to optimize your inventory control to balance between being able to quickly fulfill orders while keeping warehousing and managing costs as low as possible.</p>
<h2 class="p6">Real Time Inventory</h2>
<p class="p1">Integrating tools for <a href="https://www.skubana.com/multi-channel-inventory-management/">real-time inventory management</a> allows you to manage and track orders across sales channels, so that you always know your real inventory and don&#8217;t drop below par level.</p>
<p class="p1">This makes it easier to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Track re-order points to prevent a stockout</li>
<li class="p1">Track actual sales</li>
<li class="p1">Prioritize fulfilment for popular items</li>
<li class="p1">Manage returns and replacement items.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Each of these will, in turn, boost your order fulfilment speed so that customers get the item they want as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3 class="p6">EDI</h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://support.skubana.com/hc/en-us/articles/219080177--HOW-TO-Adding-Bigcommerce-as-a-Sales-Channel">Setting up an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) integration</a> can save you money and allow you to speed up your inventory processes, because you can:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Communicate orders more quickly</li>
<li class="p1">Automate order forms</li>
<li class="p1">Automatically track shipments</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This allows you to reduce lead times so that you have to carry less total inventory and can improve communication with customers, while investing less in manual data entry.</p>

<p class="p1">While quality inventory control and management typically requires investing in sales forecasts, technology, and data, it is well worth your time and money to do so. Inventory impacts your ecommerce store at every level, and improving it can save and earn you money for the long term.</p>

<p class="p1">The simple process of keeping track of goods purchased and sold is complicated by costs, overhead, rate of sale or turnover, cost of purchase, and other details that can be difficult to manage as your online sales grow.</p>
<p class="p1">However, you need <a href="http://ecommercetips.org/3-problems-with-amazon-inventory-management/">accurate inventory management</a> to maintain the profitability of your store, as inventory carrying costs can represent <a href="https://www.skubana.com/e-commerce/understanding-sku-growth-how-increasing-inventory-affects-costs-management/">as much as 25% of your inventory value</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition, poor management, which results in out of stock events and overstocking, can be costly.</p>
<p class="p1">Overstocking means you could get stuck paying for storage and management for items you might never sell, while selling out loses customers, can slow shipping time, and reduce customer satisfaction.</p>
<p class="p1">This is especially relevant for Amazon sellers, whose listings and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seo-strategy/">Amazon SEO will plummet if a product is out of stock</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Maintaining an accurate inventory count allows you to manage reorders, keep just enough inventory in stock to meet demand, and reduce costs by understanding your sales and losses.</p>
<p class="p1">While there are numerous elements of your inventory that will require care, you can start by ensuring that your physical inventory counts are accurate, so that the rest of your data is correct as well.</p>
<h1 class="p2">How to Physically Organize Your Inventory</h1>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/factory-700588_960_720.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20148" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/factory-700588_960_720.jpg" alt="factory-700588_960_720" width="650" height="433" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/factory-700588_960_720.jpg 960w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/factory-700588_960_720-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/factory-700588_960_720-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The first step to accurate inventory counts is simply organizing your inventory. While very small ecommerce stores often skip this step, it becomes more and more crucial as your inventory grows.</p>
<p class="p1">Organization allows you to understand what you have, how you are keeping track of it, and gain a better understanding of your data once you perform a count.</p>
<p class="p1">The first element of organizing your inventory should almost always be physical organization.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Label bins</li>
<li class="p1">Create a structured order</li>
<li class="p1">Integrate an inventory movement system such as “first in, last out” or “last in first out.”</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">This will enable you to<a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-warehousing/"> track where items are in your warehouse</a> and handle counts more quickly.</p>
<p class="p1">Great organization necessitates a quality inventory control system comprised of detailed labelling and naming.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Inventory Labeling</h2>
<p class="p1">Using physical labels gives you the opportunity to improve the accuracy of your inventory count using technology like barcode scanners. Even if you manufacture all your products yourself, you should have a physical labelling system that matches your digital inventory count.</p>
<p class="p1">Your label should include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">SKU (Stock-Keeping-Unit)</li>
<li class="p1">UPC/EAN</li>
<li class="p1">Measurements</li>
<li class="p1">Location, if applicable</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">Inventory Naming</h2>
<p class="p1">You need quality, organized inventory names to track and manage your inventory and stock levels. In most cases, this means using or creating SKU numbers to track your internal inventory while adopting and using other technology for efficiency and retail sale.</p>
<p class="p1">You also need actual product names, which should be descriptive based on product type, size, color, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">Many of us are tempted to create product names that are semantic, but good inventory  management means creating titles that are searchable.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Semantic:</strong> Blue Chuck Taylor Converse Shoes</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Searchable:</strong> Converse, Chuck Taylor, Blue, Size 8.5</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Why? If you’re attempting to perform a manual update and you’re using &#8220;Blue Converse Shoes,&#8221; your shoes would be located under &#8220;Blue&#8221; and not under &#8220;Converse.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">By creating a non-semantic naming system, you can categorize the most important part of the product first. It also makes performing inventory counts easier, because you can more easily see what a product is.</p>
<h2 class="p4">SKU</h2>
<p class="p1">A SKU is the smallest saleable unit of any inventory (for example a pack of paper cups or a vacuum) and allows you to track internal goods and quantities. If you don’t have your own SKUs, create them today and start using them for inventory tracking.</p>
<p class="p1">A good SKU is descriptive of the product, between 4 and 14 characters long, does not contain special symbols, and is unique.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, using a simple first letter and product number system, you could create SKUs like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Chocolate bar – SKU: CB001</li>
<li class="p1">Chocolate bar, vanilla – SKU: CB001-01</li>
<li class="p1">Chocolate bar, hazelnut – SKU: CB001-02</li>
<li class="p1">Toffee – SKU: T002</li>
<li class="p1">Toffee, Caramel – SKU: T002-01</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This type of system allows you to neatly organize everything in your system in alphanumeric order. This improves the accuracy of your counts by ensuring that you can clearly see what each item is, and what variation.</p>
<p class="p1">On the other hand, if you were to start an SKU off like 0001ABC you would have no way to find the SKU with a sort function, and you can’t tell what it is at a glance.</p>
<p class="p1">SKUs allow you to update the number of physical units you have available for sale, and organize everything into your own system that makes sense for your company.</p>
<p class="p1">They also make it easy to handle physical organization using either alphabetical or numerical organization. For example, if you use a system that values each SKU based on when it was added to your system (First: 0001, Last, 12987, you can easily structure and organize your entire warehouse.</p>
<p class="p1">If your warehouse is large enough, and you manage all your inventory from a single location, you can also add location to your SKUs. However, this is not recommended if you use Amazon FBA, a third-party logistics company, or another type of external fulfilment.</p>
<h3 class="p1">How to Create SKUs in BigCommerce</h3>
<p class="p1">There are multiple ways to create SKUs in the BigCommerce platform. There are two main options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Import products and SKUs from an excel file</li>
<li class="p1">Create custom SKUs on a per product basis</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">For those wanting to create custom SKUs on a per product basis, you have a few options. Each product within BigCommerce can have more than 500 variants or options. This means 500 various SKUs for a single product type. Of course, you can also have a single product with no options, as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is how you set that up.</p>
<p class="p1">Navigate to your products page in the BigCommerce platform. Click &#8220;Add.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce.png"><img class="wp-image-20144 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce.png" alt="add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce" width="650" height="414" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce.png 1150w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce-300x191.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add-new-products-SKU-BigCommerce-750x477.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Now, where you add in your SKU will depend on if you have a single variant or option for your product, or multiple.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce.png"><img class="wp-image-20145 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce.png" alt="how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce" width="650" height="380" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce.png 1159w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce-300x175.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how-to-add-SKUs-BigCommerce-750x438.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If you have multiple options or variants for each product, you have two options in adding SKUs.</p>

<h2 class="p4">Units of Measure</h2>
<p class="p1">You can add units of measure into your SKUs or product labelling system to track how much of any given item you have, making it easy to perform counts.</p>
<p class="p1">By ensuring that you have approved units of measure, you can create a system that allows you to track SKU volume using a simple and efficient method.</p>
<p class="p1">Common measurements include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Unit</li>
<li class="p1">Each</li>
<li class="p1">Pound</li>
<li class="p1">Gram</li>
<li class="p1">Crate</li>
<li class="p1">Box</li>
<li class="p1">24 Count</li>
<li class="p1">12 Count</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">By establishing which units of measure you use and creating standardized abbreviations for them (for example; ea. instead of EA, Ea, EA(s)), you can organize your count process because you know what each quantity stands for.</p>
<h2 class="p4">UPC / EAN Barcode</h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/barcode-485220_960_720.png"><img class="wp-image-20149 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/barcode-485220_960_720.png" alt="barcode-485220_960_720" width="650" height="647" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/barcode-485220_960_720.png 723w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/barcode-485220_960_720-300x299.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/barcode-485220_960_720-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Any retail item needs a UPC or Universal Product Code. If you purchase mass-market products instead of manufacturing your own, they should automatically feature both a UPC and EAN Barcode.</p>
<p class="p1">UPC and EAN are almost always used in combination with each other, and can be used to introduce technology like barcode scanning to speed up inventory counts.  If you manufacture your own product, you will have to purchase UPC and EAN codes to use them.</p>
<p class="p1">UPC is valuable because it refers to a specific unit but not necessarily the smallest unit of sale. So, a UPC can include a box of 24 individual units, allowing you to scan in a crate or a box rather than having to scan individual items. This can speed up inventory count a great deal when managing bulk purchases.</p>
<h2 class="p4">ISSN/ISBN/ISMN</h2>
<p class="p1">If you are selling books, magazines, journals, or music, you have to use ISSN, ISBN, or ISMN (International Standard Serial Number, International Standard Book Number, and International Standard Music Number). These numbers function almost the same as UPC/EAN but are assigned by the publisher using a unique publisher code.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Amazon ASIN</h2>
<p class="p1">If you sell on Amazon, you must use Amazon&#8217;s ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number), but you can use it in tandem with your own SKU.</p>
<p class="p1">In most cases, the best inventory naming policy is to integrate the primary universal number (ISBN, UPC, etc.) with your own internal SKU system. Combining these systems allows you to use electronic tracking to easily scan barcodes during counts to improve accuracy, while using your own system for organization and search. This gives you maximum control over your system, while allowing for the most efficient electronic counts.</p>
<h1 class="p2">How to Ensure Accuracy</h1>
<p class="p1">Improving the accuracy of your physical inventory count means taking charge of your inventory process so that you can control when and how items are counted.</p>
<p class="p1">The first step should be to track moving inventory, so that you know where every item in your inventory is at all times.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, many inventory systems add inventory in transit from the manufacturer but fail to note the location of the inventory, which can cause inaccurate inventory counts.</p>
<p class="p1">Integrating location labeling and ensuring that your inventory management system integrates with your supplier or manufacturer will solve this problem.</p>
<p class="p1">You can also integrate barcode scanning to scan every item in and out of your warehouse to track incoming and outgoing inventory, and automatically move it to a new location.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Cycle Counting</h2>
<p class="p1">You need regular physical counts to ensure the accuracy of your digital inventory. The more secluded your warehouse and the fewer employees you have, the less necessary this becomes, but you should physically count all your stock at least once per year no matter what.</p>
<p class="p1">Stock is often lost, broken, damaged, or misrepresented in your inventory system. A physical count will give you a better idea of what you have, so that you can update your system to match.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use item count for large items.</strong> UPC and EAN barcode scanning speeds up this process and reduces human error.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use rough calculations for items that are too small to warrant item counting.</strong> Use weight or volume measurements to calculate rough estimates of how many small items (like plastic bags or packages of small toys) you have so you can save costs.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use valuation to prioritize your top selling inventory.</strong> Track your sales so that you understand which products make you the most money, and prioritize them in your count. If you sell 100+ of one item and less than 5 of another per month, it&#8217;s more important to count the 100+ item multiple times per year.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Consider completing a cycle count of top-selling stock at least once per quarter.</strong></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Consider creating stock sheets</strong> and having receivers counter sign them for accuracy and auditing purposes if you have a large warehouse.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">Inventory auditing</h2>
<p class="p1">Human error is one of the primary causes of inventory count issues. For this reason, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-warehousing/">a strong inventory audit process</a> should be part of your inventory count. By auditing your count as part of the process, you can strategically check every count as part of your process.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use a control officer</strong> to begin checking inventory counts against expected numbers as soon as the count begins. If you wait until the count is over, you&#8217;ll have to do a recount to audit.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Ensure that the count is performed by someone familiar with the products</strong>. If you&#8217;re counting boxes, it&#8217;s easier to count if you know what is in the box and how many.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Create an organized count process</strong>. Start with top selling products, count in alphabetical order, or count based on location, but use a process to ensure that everything is counted.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>The auditor should inspect the inventory during the count.</strong></li>
<li class="p1"><strong>The auditor should observe the stock counting procedure</strong> to make sure that it is adequate.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="p2">How to Make It All So Much Easier</h1>
<p class="p1">The easiest way to improve your inventory counts is to make your system easy to use. By taking steps to create better organization, reduce stock, and define areas of importance, you can make cycle counts faster and more accurate.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Reduce Your Stock</h2>
<p class="p1">While it&#8217;s not right for every ecommerce store, stock reduction using a JIT (Just in Time) or other inventory management system can greatly reduce the volume of stock you have to count. This will improve accuracy, because you will have fewer items to count.</p>
<p class="p1">JIT inventory management relies on understanding how much you sell and when, so that you can stock just enough to order again Just in Time to prevent a stock out.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Inventory Locations</h2>
<p class="p1">Clearly defining inventory locations as part of your system is crucial to inventory accuracy. While many leave this out of their inventory management system, a defined location allows you to easily see if the stock should be at your warehouse, in transit, with a third-party logistics company, or in manufacturing, so that you can account for it even if it isn&#8217;t in your warehouse.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Automate</h2>
<p class="p1">Automate alerts or re-orders when stock reaches certain levels to avoid overstocking. This can save you money on storage, but will also reduce the burden on cycle counts by ensuring that you never have too much of an item.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Cross-Channel Inventory</h2>
<p class="p1">While a reliable number relies on a physical count, you also have to know what your actual inventory should be.</p>
<p class="p1">If you&#8217;re selling through multiple sales channels like Amazon and eBay plus your own site, you’ll need cross-channel inventory management to avoid mistakes. A <a href="https://www.skubana.com/">cross-channel inventory management system</a> will allow you to sync your inventory in real time, so that you know your sales and total inventory across all channels.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/modern-inventory-management/">Consolidating your multi-channel inventory</a> makes physical counts easier, gives you more foresight when it comes to planning, and helps prevent problems.</p>
<h1 class="p2">Establish Standards</h1>
<p class="p1">Creating an internal policy of organization and counting will help to ensure that you keep track of your stock over the long-term. Using EAN barcodes to scan items in and out of warehouses, ensuring that deliveries and delivery counts are verified manually, and using an auditing system to prevent loss or theft can greatly improve your internal organization.</p>
<p class="p1">Great inventory management will reduce your costs by helping you to avoid overstocking or selling out, and enhance customer service by offering faster fulfilment. Create a brand policy of regular inventory cycle counts, develop strong internal organization, and use the right technology.</p>
