<p class="p1">The retail space is competitive and ever-changing. No one wants to be held to a 12-month launch timeline costing half a million dollars or more for an ecommerce campaign, B2C site or employee site.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why dozens of enterprise brands at the leading edge of technology are choosing SaaS –– specifically, BigCommerce –– to power new ecommerce initiatives and stay competitive in a quick-to-innovate market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing a trend with large brands leveraging SaaS ecommerce platforms to design shopping experiences in a fraction of the time and cost as legacy systems without compromising requirements.</p>
<p class="p1">These shopping experiences vary from creating unique direct to consumer shopping channels on social media to custom purchasing portals that serve a B2B customer segment. This is all representing a shift in approach, &#8216;Agile Commerce&#8217;, that brands are taking in order to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer needs.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re excited because the BigCommerce Enterprise platform is uniquely positioned to support large brands&#8217; unique challenges of being agile while meeting enterprise requirements of performance, security and flexibility at scale.&#8221; –– Daniel Townsend, Founding Partner, <a href="http://www.plumtreegroup.net/">The Plum Tree Group</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">Here are the top 7 ways enterprise brands are getting SaaS on their approved vendor list to increase campaign revenue, sell additional inventory and launch brand innovation initiatives on time and under budget.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Direct-to-Consumer Deployments</h2>
<p class="p1">Legacy B2B and wholesale brands are needing to launch additional B2C channels to harness consumer fanfare around their product.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/b2b-ecommerce/">With B2B still priority for the business</a>, these B2C sites must be cost-effective, meet modern UX standards and pass procurement’s strict requirements for stability and security.</p>
<p class="p1">See how these 8 enterprise brands make this work.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Streamlined B2B Ecommerce</h2>
<p class="p1">As the new generation of buyers ages into management positions, more and more B2B customers are wanting to buy online –– and expecting the same B2C UX experience they get elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p1">This market <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/B2B-Ecommerce-Market-Still-Maturing/1014311">is expected to account for</a> $6.7 trillion by 2020 –– 27% of all B2B sales.</p>
<p class="p1">For Koch Industries’ Georgia Pacific brands, BigCommerce is the solution of choice for a portal-restricted site that allows fast and convenient B2B purchasing of their Bleached Board cardboard.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21350" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/georgia-pacific.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/georgia-pacific.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/georgia-pacific-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/georgia-pacific-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 class="p3">Franchise Stores</h2>
<p class="p1">Delaware North is one of the U.S.’s largest umbrella brands. Headquartered in Buffalo, the company operates in the lodging, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/sports-outdoors/">sporting</a>, airport, gaming and entertainment industries, employing more than 55,000 people worldwide and generating over $2.6 billion in annual revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">Each of Delaware North’s individual brands operates as a franchise establishment, with local management and brand rules. However, top-flight technology spans their catalog. Multiple of Delaware North’s franchise operations –– including the Carolina Panthers and the Grand Canyon’s merchandise store –– use BigCommerce to power their fan sites and drive additional online revenue from loyal consumers.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Carolina Panthers</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-21351" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carolina-panthers-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carolina-panthers-1.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carolina-panthers-1-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carolina-panthers-1-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3 class="p4">Grand Canyon Store</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-21352" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shop-grand-canyon.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shop-grand-canyon.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shop-grand-canyon-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shop-grand-canyon-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 class="p3">Upselling and Reselling</h2>
<p class="p1">Assurant and T-Mobile’s device upgrade partnership allows T-Mobile customers to send in their old devices. Those devices end up in an Assurant warehouse.</p>
<p class="p1">When the old phones began taking up too much space, the Assurant team decided to offer the phones to employees at customized prices –– launching a B2E site on BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p1">Three months in, the employee store was so successful, Assurant launched the reselling site to the public and wholesalers as an additional revenue channel pulling in both B2C and B2B revenue.</p>
<p class="p1">Their BigCommerce website utilizes <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Setting-up-Customer-Groups">built-in Customer Groups</a> to allow three audience segments to purchase from one website.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Assurant’s MyWit Brand</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-21353" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/my-wit.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/my-wit.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/my-wit-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/my-wit-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 class="p3">B2E + Internal Collateral Self-Service</h2>
<p class="p1">Cargill uses BigCommerce to manage marketing collateral via downloads, as well as requesting collateral creation for various business units. The company uses SSO/SAML to authenticate users with SailPoint. That way, if an employee is no longer with the company or if a random user tries to login, they will be blocked.</p>
<p class="p1">Other B2E use cases we see across brands like DuPont and Sony are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Employee uniform online stores or items employees are required to purchase for the job.</li>
<li class="p1">Selling product at cost to employees, or offering them special product for being an employee.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p4">Cargill</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cargill.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21354" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cargill.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cargill.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cargill-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/cargill-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p4">Sony</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sony.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21355" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sony.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sony.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sony-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/sony-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">Education and Publishing Vertical</h2>
<p class="p1">Ecommerce has disrupted the business model of every industry –– and education is no different. This is why universities and traditional textbook suppliers like Harvard and Nelson Education have partnered with BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p1">Harvard is launching a direct to consumer site to sell educational material to the public –– helping to spread the power of knowledge far beyond Cambridge.</p>
<p class="p1">Nelson Education is taking this idea even further. With BigCommerce (and partner <a href="https://beapartof.com/">Be a Part Of</a>), the brand is launching both a direct to consumer site for students, as well as a B2B site for schools to purchase bulk orders on a regular basis –– <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Setting-up-Customer-Groups">using built-in customer groups</a> to pre-populate negotiated prices and a quoting tool for quotes on the spot, no phone call required.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Nelson Education</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-21356" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nelson-education.png" alt="" width="640" height="312" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nelson-education.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nelson-education-300x146.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nelson-education-750x366.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 class="p3">The Power to Innovate</h2>
<p class="p1">Are you wanting to take your business to the next level with an innovative solution or campaign? Geo-targeted roll outs are common for enterprise brands to test out demand and feasibility before expanding to larger markets.</p>
<p class="p1">Philip Morris uses the BigCommerce platform for invite-only access to the company’s new cigarette delivery service in Australia. Philip Morris is <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38152297">already making headlines</a> in the UK for eliminating the conventional cigarette and removing them from convenient stores thanks to immediate delivery.</p>
<p class="p1">In V2, they will be rolling out API integrations with BigCommerce to become the UberEats of cigarettes.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21357" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/philip-morris.png" alt="" width="640" height="332" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/philip-morris.png 1449w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/philip-morris-300x155.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/philip-morris-750x389.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">The move to SaaS has only begun. As SaaS platforms like BigCommerce continue to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/man-crates-ecommerce-api-integrations/">innovate and open APIs</a>, enterprise brands can shift resources from tech debt to marketing and advertising spend, which increase sales and boost the bottom line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;BigCommerce Enterprise has allowed our agency to address the myriad needs of large ecommerce brands and enterprise businesses. BigCommerce&#8217;s offering allows us to quickly plan and implement unique shopping and content experiences for a wide range of customer groups and product types, without sacrificing finance, logistics, or operations requirements.</p>
<p class="p1">With BigCommerce Enterprise&#8217;s best in class hosting, security, support, and an exceptional product development team, we&#8217;re enabled to better service our enterprise clients than with other SaaS ecommerce solutions.&#8221; –– Jordan Brannon, Director of Digital Strategy, <a href="https://coalitiontechnologies.com/">Coalition Technologies</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">It’s a new era –– and we’re incredibly excited to be a part of it.</p>

Even if you only had $1,000 to invest in 1997, today you’d have more than $626,000.</p>
<p class="p1">But who could have predicted back then that an online bookstore would, in two decades time, become one of the world’s most dominant online stores –– offering everything from the books they started with to the high-end fashion that resisted for so long?</p>
<p class="p1">20 years ago, there were a measly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/01/business/money-starts-to-show-in-internet-shopping.html">40 million people</a> using the internet in the U.S., and online sales generated only $2.4 billion. In 2017, more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2237/internet-usage-in-the-united-states/">287 million people in the U.S. alone</a> use the internet –– and online sales are expected to hit <a href="http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/report-online-retail-sales-hit-0-billion-01">$440 billion by year end</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">That is an 18,650% increase in global internet usage and an 18,233% increase in online sales.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Since 1997, there has been a 18,650% increase in global internet usage and an 18,233% increase in online sales.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Amazon’s stock price has risen in equal measure, from $18 in 1997 to around $948 at the time of writing –– a 5,166% increase.</p>
<p class="p1">This is no chicken and egg problem –– clearly the internet and online sales came first. But these days, it’s hard to tell whether Amazon grows larger as the internet and online sales do, or if the internet and online sales grow larger as Amazon does.</p>
<p class="p1">Either way, the relationship is symbiotic, and though for much of Amazon’s history small business and other verticalized online sellers made an enemy of the marketplace, <a href="https://www.junglescout.com/bright-future-for-amazon-sellers/">those tides are very quickly changing</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">After all, as the ecommerce industry hits one milestone after the other –– so, too, does Amazon.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Ecommerce + Amazon Facts and Stats</h2>
<p class="p1">You might feel the quickening pace at which ecommerce adoption and innovation is hitting market.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your business may be having to turn to online for inbound sales in an industry where business has historically been conducted over the phone.</li>
<li class="p1">Or perhaps you are now having to look to AI to implement new buyer journeys for Gen Z purchasers.</li>
<li class="p1">Or perhaps you simply feel the pressure to give your shoppers the options for free or two-day shipping –– just to compete in today’s competitive ecommerce market.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You are not wrong in that feeling. The innovative steps and measures taken today by online brands are part of an ongoing story about modern human convenience and the technology we wield to achieve it.</p>
<p class="p1">And Amazon has been a large part of the story for 20 years. Let’s take a look.</p>
<h3 class="p4">1997</h3>

</ul>
<h2 class="p3">The Converging of Retail</h2>
<p class="p1">As you can see, 2016 was a pivotal year for online brands when it came to sentiment about selling on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, as the world’s 5th largest company, online brands have come to understand that trying to compete with Amazon is not an effective business strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead, these brands have turned to finding ways to leverage the marketplace to their advantage –– growing sales and driving revenue through channels beyond their webstore.</p>
<p class="p1">Looking only at BigCommerce merchants, we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">20% of BigCommerce customers have connected their websites to at least one additional channel, like Amazon.</li>
<li class="p1">Of merchants who have enabled Amazon, roughly 12% of cumulative GMV comes through Amazon.</li>
<li class="p1">According to a recent survey of BigCommerce merchants, 73% of SMBs are considering expanding to sell on Amazon or eBay in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">The Amazon Timeline</h2>
<p class="p1">Here is what the past 20 years look like, visually, as Amazon and other online brands converge –– offering merchants additional product options, prices and convenience at every step along the way.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21068" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic.jpg" alt="amazon timeline" width="500" height="2950" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic.jpg 500w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/amazon-timeline-infographic-300x1770.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">What does this mean for your brand?</h2>
<p class="p1">Selling on Amazon may not be the right choice for all brands –– depending on the products you sell and the stage of growth you are in.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s look at a few ways to determine whether your brand is ready to sell on Amazon.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Offer Unique Items, Not Third-Party</h3>
<p class="p1">According to James Thomson, Partner at the Buy Box Experts and former Head of Selling on Amazon, the products that do best on Amazon are unique items. This means goods you manufacture and sell yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is a short list of BigCommerce merchants <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-success-stories/">selling successfully</a> both on their webstore and on Amazon to give you an idea of what “unique products” means:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Dazadi</li>
<li class="p1">Austin Bazaar</li>
<li class="p1">Kap7</li>
<li class="p1">The Dairy Fairy</li>
<li class="p1">BeachRC</li>
<li class="p1">Folding Chairs and Tables</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">In general, if you both make and sell your own unique products, you are a good candidate for selling and succeeding on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Is Your Business a Good Fit for Amazon?</h3></p>
<p class="p1">In this piece, James Thomson gets in-depth about <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/what-to-know-before-selling-on-amazon/">who should (and more importantly, who should *not*) sell on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">Set Up Your Amazon Channel Right – The First Time</h3>
<p class="p1">There are plenty of nuances to successfully selling on Amazon, in the same way there are nuances to successfully selling on your webstore. Here are a few to watch out for:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Get your taxes in working orders:</strong> immediately upon signing up a new seller account, go into the Settings –&gt; Tax Settings, and designate not only in which states you want Amazon to collect state sales tax, but also set the “Use default Product Tax Code” setting to “A_GEN_TAX.”</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Measure profitability accurately:</strong> Don’t average everything out, and look only at your overall sales numbers and margins. Start thinking about every SKU you sell on Amazon as having its own P&amp;L, its own market forces, and its own level and types of competitions. Such an approach has helped many a seller rationalize its catalog, focusing on bottom line growth ahead of all other financial goals.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Look out for duplicate listings from competitors:</strong> Duplicate listings on Amazon can be an effective way for competitors to divert traffic away from your product listings back to theirs. It’s worth, at least once a quarter, to search the whole Amazon catalog for duplicate listings of your items.</li>

<p class="p1">James Thomson is back at it again giving you all the dirty details to the most common selling on Amazon mistakes –– and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-selling-pitfalls-problems/">how to make sure you don’t make any of them</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">Know if You Need to Outsource</h3>
<p class="p1">If selling on Amazon is new for you, remember that you do not have to do all of the selling, setup or optimization by yourself. It may be worth it for your to hire a few outside and experienced sources to help you with tasks so you can focus on both your webstore and your Amazon channel growth.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ve put together a list of more than 230 companies that do just that, and sectioned them out by the service they offer and how to know you need them.</p>
<p class="p1">You can get the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-solution-provider-directory/">free directory</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Amazon-Directory-Solutions-Providers/dp/1544287208/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494445539&amp;sr=1-2">buy it on Amazon</a> to keep a physical copy on hand.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Looking to Optimize Your Amazon SEO?</h3></p>
<p class="p1">You’re in luck! Use our <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-asin-lookup-tool/">free ASIN Lookup tool</a> to figure out which keywords your competitors are using to rank highly on Amazon –– and then alter your strategy to boost your rankings (and your sales).</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p4">Sell What Works</h3>
<p class="p1">Folding Chairs and Tables now sees more than 10% of their revenue coming directly from Amazon –- and they’ve only been selling on Amazon a couple months.</p>
<p class="p1">How did they become so successful so fast?</p>
<p class="p1">By focusing on a single product they sell nowhere else on the web.</p>
<p class="p1">Using their BigCommerce Analytics, they were able to see which products sell the best together and offered a table + chairs listing combo on Amazon that immediately beat out other listings and drove increased sales to their brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, they are exploring additional product bundle launches on Amazon –– keeping their offerings on the marketplace and on their webstore different for the various audiences that shop on either one.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">If your brand is a fit to sell on Amazon, start doing so now. Amazon isn’t going anywhere –– and as they expand to additional markets and continue to invest in the latest and greatest in ecommerce innovation, your brand and products will be right there along for the ride.</p>
<p class="p1">20 years ago, had you invested, you’d be half a million dollars richer. Don’t let the opportunity pass you by again.</p>

<p class="p1">Whether it be through email campaigns, advertising or content marketing, brands must find a way to entice shoppers to buy – with their brand and at that moment – more so than ever before.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, we’re excited to share a new way BigCommerce merchants can make marketing campaigns even more successful — <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/buy-button/">the BigCommerce Buy Button</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Why We Built a Buy Button</h2>
<p class="p1">In 2015, there were a slew of announcements about Buy Buttons, which press wrote about as the next evolution of &#8216;social commerce.&#8217;</p>
<p class="p1">Fast forward 2 years and Buy Buttons haven&#8217;t yet taken off on social media, and brands continue to look for new, creative ways to sell products off-site –– making marketing campaigns and content more shoppable with less friction in the purchase process.</p>
<p class="p1">In those two years, it became clear that there was a need for a consolidated Buy Button brands themselves could own and launch. Giving brands the power, allows them to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Execute on campaigns more quickly, through both owned and third-party channels</li>
<li class="p1">Standardized reporting on Buy Button success across their company</li>
<li class="p1">Allow for various marketing and sales channel owners to use and launch buy buttons as needed</li>
<li class="p1">Customize Buy Button purchasing funnel flows as necessary for the campaign and in line with individual brand standards</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This follows the same logic as any emerging industry. At first, there are a disparate amount of options which later conglomerate into only a few, the most useful winning the lion’s share.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to Buy Buttons, that market is still relatively untapped –– forcing store owners and online marketers to use a variety of buttons across a variety of platforms with mixed reporting and analytics data to prove value.</p>
<p class="p1">Our engineers set out to fix that.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Install the BigCommerce Buy Button</h3></p>
<p class="p1">With a single click, BigCommerce customers can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/buy-buttons/">begin using the Buy Button right now</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">A Buy Button Built for Customization and Analytics</h2>
<p class="p1">Today, BigCommerce’s Buy Button officially launches within Channel Manager. Already, more than 400 online stores have installed the button and begun using it. We’ve interviewed many of them, worked through bugs and are now confident that the BigCommerce Buy Button is ready for the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">From a user perspective, the flow to create a card, button, or link is very intuitive. Plus, I love all the options already built-in. Having those customizations already there is really important because a lot of other platforms that have options to embed iframes are cookie-cutter. The amount of options on BigCommerce’s Buy Buttons is what really caught my attention at first.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, having the option to put Google tracking analytics or UTMs on it is really important to me. Honestly, inputs like that just plain make sense –– otherwise you wouldn’t be able to track success.</p>
<p class="p1">– Kyle Glaser, Founder and CEO, <a href="http://store.parkway.tv/">Parkway.tv</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The BigCommerce Buy Buttons allow shoppers to buy individual products right from your blog, website, emails and more. Now, you can make mini shopping experiences outside of your BigCommerce store to sell on other websites, in emails, through ads and on your own site, as needed.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://demo.buybutton.store">Test it out for yourself</a>:</p>
<p><iframe style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 3px; margin-left: 2.5%;" src="https://demo.buybutton.store/" width="95%" height="800"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Learn More About the Buy Button</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Choose your variants, edit your text and drop in the card, button or link anywhere! <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Buy-Buttons-app">Learn more here</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">This button is unlike those you will find elsewhere on the web –– whether it be on social media, in an email platform or even on another ecommerce platform provider.</p>
<p class="p1">First and foremost, they allow you to choose how you want to link the button. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">A card</li>
<li class="p1">A button</li>
<li class="p1">A link</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21038" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2.png" alt="" width="640" height="302" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2.png 1389w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2-300x142.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-2-750x354.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">From there, you can choose to send those who click on the card, button or link either to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Checkout page</li>
<li class="p1">Shopping cart</li>
<li class="p1">Product page</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21039" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="302" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1.png 1391w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1-300x142.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-1-750x354.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">For the card and button options, you can choose to open the page in a pop-up window, on a new tab or in the same tab. In addition, you can add a UTM source code to track the performance of your Buy Buttons in both your BigCommerce and Google Analytics.</p>
<p class="p1">In BigCommerce, it will show up here:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21031" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1.png" alt="" width="640" height="365" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1.png 1179w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1-300x171.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-1-750x428.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And then you can dive deeper into that campaign tab, here:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21032" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4.png" alt="" width="640" height="256" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4.png 1111w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4-300x120.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-4-750x300.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p5" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of how your Buy Button campaign UTM would appear on the backend.</em></p>
<p class="p1">In addition, Buy Button conversion will soon appear in the store performance dashboard, and  will display orders that come from <em>direct-to-checkout</em> links (which you can choose as you set up your buy button).</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21033" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics.png" alt="" width="640" height="301" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics.png 1110w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-300x141.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-buttons-analytics-750x353.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">Advanced Buy Button Customization and Analytics</h2>
<p class="p1">Beyond the basic UTM tagging, button-type choice and UX flow, we’ve also built in advanced features to allow for further customization to match your brand and better sync with your Google Analytics for goal and conversion tracking.</p>
<p class="p1">Take a look at how quickly I was able to customize the button just by playing around with it.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksEotH9IoQY" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">The Google Analytics ID is where you will input your <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en">Google Tracking ID</a> to track traffic, clicks and conversion on the button. Here is how you find your tracking ID:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Sign in to <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/web/#home/">your Analytics account</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">Click <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6132368">Admin</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">Select an account from the menu in the ACCOUNT column.</li>
<li class="p1">Select a property from the menu in the PROPERTY column.</li>
<li class="p1">Under PROPERTY, click Tracking Info &gt; Tracking Code.
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977">tracking ID and property number</a> are displayed at the top of the page.</li>
<li class="p1">Information about tracking apps is displayed under Mobile app tracking &#8211; <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7373305">Using the SDK</a>.</li>
<li class="p1">The <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6086097">tracking-code snippet</a> for your website is displayed under Website tracking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">The Google Analytics ID on the BigCommerce Buy Button now saves between sessions on the same device, so you only have to input it once.</p>
<h3 class="p7">User-Level Access and Usage</h3>
<p class="p1">At first install, the Buy Button is only available for account owners to use. You can edit this and allow additional members of your team to create their own buttons, cards or links as needed.</p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Store-Owner?q=user+accounts&amp;l=en_US&amp;fs=Search&amp;pn=1">Store Owner</a> can create / delete users and grant permissions from <a href="https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/settings/users">Account Settings › Users</a> under Single-Click Apps.</p>

<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Install the BigCommerce Buy Button</h3></p>
<p class="p1">With a single click, BigCommerce customers can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/buy-buttons/">begin using the Buy Button right now</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">Where and How to Use the BigCommerce Buy Button</h2>
<p class="p1">There are a variety of use cases for the BigCommerce Buy Button and a few best practices for each. The most common ways the 412 brands already using the button are implementing it are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Email campaigns</li>
<li class="p1">Blogs</li>
<li class="p1">Affiliates, Influencers and Press</li>
<li class="p1">AdRoll</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Here are exactly how to use the BigCommerce Buy Buttons in each use case above, and recommended best practices.</p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Buttons + Email Campaigns</h3>
<p class="p1">Because email providers vary on how they serve up iFrames, we do not recommend you use the Button or Card option in any of your emails. If you do, it is likely that many of your customers will not see the button, and instead will see a blank space.</p>
<p class="p1">This is true even if the button shows up and works well in preview. This isn’t an iFrame issue, it is a permissions issue on the side of the user in their email account.</p>
<p class="p1">That said, you can use the Buy Button link option in your email CTA to push people directly to product page, cart or checkout page. Many email management systems, like MailChimp, provide their own buttons that you can customize, so all you need to do is drop in the BigCommerce generated link, and you’ll achieve a streamlined customer checkout experience.</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21040" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email.png" alt="" width="640" height="241" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email.png 1395w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email-300x113.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/buy-button-link-email-750x282.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Depending on the ultimate goal of your email campaign, you may want to use various customer flows.</p>

<li class="p1"><strong>Checkout:</strong> Send customers direct to checkout if you are pushing customers to buy a single product “Right Now.” If you are using urgency or scarcity to drive up conversion, this is a good quick-to-checkout option, think flash sales, holiday sales, or “Only a Few Left in Stock!”</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Cart:</strong> Send customers direct to the shopping cart if you are looking to increase AOV from a particular customer cohort. For instance, if you have a Free Shipping offer running on banners across your site for orders over $100, send an email campaign that links to cart –– showing customers they only need $20 more of product to hit the free shipping threshold. You can easily set this up in the <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Using-Discount-Rules">discount tab on your BigCommerce backend</a>.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product page:</strong> Send customers direct to product page if you are introducing a new product, want to show off social proof or trying to drive additional traffic to a product page. Note that you may lose customers along the journey to conversion by starting higher in the funnel with this option. That said, if the customers are relatively new to your brand, this is a good option.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Remember, the best performing email campaigns only have 1 or 2 CTAs. Use the link within a CTA button provided through your email provider to track performance on your Google and BigCommerce Analytics.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>What Sending 100 Million Emails Taught Me About What Doesn’t Work</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/email-marketing-engagement-tips/">Noah Kagan details what works –– and what doesn’t –– when it comes to email marketing engagement.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Button + Blog</h3>
<p class="p1">The publishing industry has long had trouble working to monetize their efforts in the new digital age. Similarly, ecommerce brands have struggled to focus on content marketing efforts that don’t equally show off their product and push people back to conversion.</p>
<p class="p1">The transition between on-site content and checkout is often fraught with difficulties (and a bunch of various touchpoints that lose customers along the way).</p>
<p class="p1">With the BigCommerce Buy Button, you can eliminate that on your own blog and focus more on content marketing to drive traffic and increase your search engine ranking.</p>
<p class="p1">For this tactic, you can use any of the Buy Button options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Button</li>
<li class="p1">Card</li>
<li class="p1">Link</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You may even want to use various versions.</p>
<p class="p1">Some brands have used the Button option to advertise mentioned products throughout and at the end of posts. Here’s an example from the <a href="https://www.dvestore.com/">DVE Store</a>:</p>
<p class="p5"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-21035" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example.png" alt="" width="640" height="1429" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example.png 1395w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example-300x670.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bigcommerce-buy-button-blog-example-750x1675.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You can also use the linking option to link out to products exactly where they are mentioned in posts, allowing the reader to click-to-purchase and strengthening your domain with interlining.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>The Content Strategy to 3x Sales</h3></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/content-marketing-ecommerce-traffic/">One BigCommerce customer walks you through exactly what he did to 3x growth through content marketing alone. </a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Buttons + Affiliates, Influencers or Press Linking</h3>
<p class="p1">Many online brands use affiliates, influencers or the press to grow online awareness and push new customers to the site. The most important part of this type of work is being able to track the number of click-throughs and conversion in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Compensate affiliates or influencers properly</li>
<li class="p1">Determine which outlets work best for the brand (and then invest more heavily in those areas)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is where the UTM source and Google Analytics ID can be especially helpful. By giving influencers, affiliates and interested press the link to a product with these tracking mechanisms in place, you can track success across both your BigCommerce and Google Analytics.</p>
<p class="p1">The link option is most recommended here, but customer journey flow you use again depends on your desired outcome and audience.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Direct-to-checkout:</strong> This option is most useful when working with affiliates and influencers who send you the most qualified, ready-to-checkout traffic.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Direct-to-cart:</strong> This option is most useful for affiliates and influencers who send higher-funnel customers potentially looking for a Free Shipping or Discount offer at cart level.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Product page:</strong> This most useful for press gift guide round ups, where consumers are still top of funnel and new to your brand, wanting to get to know you and your product before adding to cart.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p7">Buy Buttons + AdRoll</h3>
<p class="p1">Because of the built-in tracking mechanisms and the tracking mechanisms you can install on your site on the BigCommerce backend, you can use the links within AdRoll campaigns and track performance across those campaigns.</p>
<h3 class="p7">What are AdRoll campaigns?</h3>
<p class="p1">AdRoll campaigns are ads placed across the web to drive customers back to your site. You can use them to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">target net new customers</li>
<li class="p1">retarget site visitors</li>
<li class="p1">retarget existing customers to drive up AOV and lifetime loyalty</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">To add the AdRoll pixel to your BigCommerce site (which will track performance of the ads), you can install it in either the Google Analytics box in the BigCommerce control panel or the Footer Scripts box on Stencil if you are using a Stencil theme.</p>
<p class="p7"><strong>The Google Analytics Box in BigCommerce</strong></p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlee">Kevin Lee</a> is one of the most seasoned corporate innovation leaders around. With nearly two decades of experience leading digital design teams within some of the world’s most prolific brands, Kevin has seen firsthand the prioritization of corporate innovation proliferate over the years.</p>
<p class="p1">He is a 10+ year veteran creative executive and design director with extensive experience in UX, product design and brand strategy.

<p class="p1">He works to develop integrated digital and product solutions that support business strategies for a high-performing multidisciplinary teams and the millions of global consumers who use their products.</p>
<p class="p1">Kevin’s best pieces of advice for businesses looking to drive innovation through design are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Prove Impact over Accuracy:</strong> Innovators often think too much about perfection, and carry this mindset into the discovery and approval processes. We tend to rely heavily on showcasing previous successes, mistakenly thinking that past triumphs will move the needle for our current requests. As a group, we must do a better job illustrating the big picture impact to the decision makers, many of whom have reached the pinnacles of their careers because they are also big picture impact thinkers.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Be a Storyteller:</strong> As innovators, we often focus on building stuff; developing shiny objects that we hope people will react positively to. But decision makers and end users don’t look at one interaction as an experience. We must think holistically and find ways to bring your vision to life through words and emotions. That’s the only way that stakeholders and consumers will be able to truly see where, how, when and why your digital product can work for them.</li>

<p class="p1">Our final judge is, of course, you. After all, you have been using the internet more than 20 years and buying online goods for about that same amount of time.</p>
<p class="p1">Online consumers are the most qualified experts to judge a site’s design and usability. It is web users who push companies like Google, Apple, BigCommerce and more to increase site speed, design ever more creatively and to make the online experience as simple and convenient as possible.</p>
<p class="p1">Social voting will open in May. One brand will win an award based solely on the votes of the online community. More information will be announced when the time comes to cast your vote.</p>

<p class="p1"><em><strong>As told to BigCommerce by Janeane Tolomeo, Marketing and Content Manager.</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1">“When you enter our site, you are immediately immersed in our products and brand. From there, users explore cheeses, cured meats, and our gift offering to discover something new and exciting – we love knowing they are feeling inspired and will have a phenomenal experience while enjoying or gifting our products.</p>
<p class="p1">One of our favorite features is the short descriptions on the products when you are viewing them in the product category pages. If you are interested in trying a new cheese, you can browse through and select based on images and get a short preview of what the cheese tastes like or what makes it special.  Knowing people have a sense of discovery when looking through our site is really energizing and mimics the customer experience in store as close as possible.</p>

<p class="p1">“We decided it was a great time for a redesign in 2016 because we were <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-replatforming-and-data-migration/">replatforming our ecommerce website</a> and transitioning over to BigCommerce.</p>
<p class="p1">We had some navigation issues on desktop and a separate mobile site that didn’t make for a seamless user experience. We were inspired by some of the other leading outdoor brand’s sites and their clean aesthetic, lifestyle driven photography, as well as the responsive designs we were seeing from those competitors.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the first redesign that the current team was a part of, but we can happily say that metrics are up year over year.</p>
<p class="p1">There are certainly a lot of factors involved, but the updated user experience has had positive effect on conversion. We’re also excited about the flexibility that working with BigCommerce has provided. With lower development costs, we’re able to experiment and work with new vendors that can potentially bring more value to the consumer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p1">People have to be able to find you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">In this way, Amazon works similarly to Google –– using an algorithm based search functionality that displays results for consumers based on a variety of factors.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike your webstore, however, getting found on Amazon is a constant battle.</p>
<p class="p1">You cannot build lifetime loyalty with your Amazon customers, meaning you can’t use email nurture streams to bring them back to you. Instead, you have to rely on search all the time.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">On Amazon, you have to rely on search – all the time.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">This makes it even more important that your products show up on page 1 of Amazon, and ideally in listing 1-3.</p>
<p class="p1">We worked with Amazon SEO expert Bryan Bowman in the Fall of 2016 to publish a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seo-strategy/">comprehensive, step-by-step guide to ranking on page 1 of Amazon</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">That content is invaluable, and it has helped hundreds of sellers increase their rankings and their sales on Amazon. In fact, we get emails pretty regularly telling us this.</p>
<p class="p1">Check it out (all SIC):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">I&#8217;d like to send you a big heart felt thank you for saving my business!</p>
<p class="p1">Up until April, I was selling approximately 18 units per day on Amazon. I noticed as I added more listings, my rank would increase and sales.</p>
<p class="p1">Then I noticed that my ranking fell from page 2 to page 8.</p>
<p class="p1">Sales and the sessions dropped by more than half, but my conversion rate was a still a healthy ~17%.</p>
<p class="p1">So I dropped my price to cost and cranked up the PPC. My rankings returned however it couldn&#8217;t be sustained</p>
<p class="p1">I was being out ranked by women&#8217;s corsets and listings that have been out of stock forever.</p>
<p class="p1">It wasn&#8217;t until I read your article &#8220;How To Master Amazon SEO&#8221; that I considered rearranging the Product Title. I didn&#8217;t consider that the keyword at the beginning of the title had more weight than any other words.</p>
<p class="p1">After I rearranged the title and, I fell to the floor with shock! I was on Page 1!</p>
<p class="p1">Have I wasted all this time by not updating the Product Title? So I rearranged the title, lowered the price and re-introduced PPC.</p>
<p class="p1">Sales and ranking returned.</p>
<p class="p1">THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">You can’t make up that kind of review –– and it got us over here at BigCommerce thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">How else can we help Amazon sellers sell more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">And to that, we’ve come up with a solution.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The ASIN Lookup Tool</h2>
<p class="p1">We worked with our product team to create an ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) lookup tool. After all, the Amazon ASIN database is open to the public, but not everyone knows how to leverage their API to look up a relevant ASIN number.</p>
<p class="p1">With this tool, you just drop in the link of the product, then do a reverse lookup based on the ASIN number of the product. We’ll email you the results, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">ASIN #</li>
<li class="p1">Detail Page URL</li>
<li class="p1">Title</li>
<li class="p1">Manufacturer</li>
<li class="p1">Label</li>
<li class="p1">Studio</li>
<li class="p1">Product Group</li>
<li class="p1">Product Type Name</li>
<li class="p1">EAN</li>
<li class="p1">Binding (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;ll make frequent updates to this tool to add more robust features, such as ISBN and other product identifiers.</p>
<p class="p1">But that leaves the million dollar question: how can this tool help grow your business? The answer — SEO!</p>
<h3 class="p1">Let’s take the Amazon seller’s example above…</h3>
<p class="p1">Had he been able to do a reverse ASIN lookup on Page 1 results for the search queries he wanted to rank for, he would have been able to see immediately that his product title was vastly different than the titles of ranking products. Plus, if applicable, he may have seen that his product group and product type name were also off.</p>
<p class="p1">All of these details are particularly important to Amazon’s search algorithm –– but are often hidden from view of regular web browsers.</p>
<p class="p1">Our new ASIN generator tool removes that layer –– emailing you all available information on a product the ranking of which you want to replicate.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Here is Your Free ASIN Lookup Tool</h2>
<p><iframe style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 3px; margin-left: 2.5%;" src="https://moar-tools-moar-progress.com/amazon/asin-tool.php" width="95%" height="400"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">Keep in mind, reviews matter a lot for Amazon SEO as well. Keywords and categorization alone won’t get you to the top, but they will certainly help.</p>
<p class="p1">Many Amazon sellers have long been wondering how to get an Amazon ASIN number, and an easy solution has finally arrived.</p>

<p class="p1">Jeff Cohen of Seller Labs walks you through all the reasons why, and even maybe why not, you’d want to launch a webstore to supplement your Amazon business. The best reason he finds is so that you don’t get cut off at the ankles.</p>
<h3 class="p4"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ShopTalk-Amazon-Handout-2754-6x9-print-booklet-AK.pdf">Amazon Pay Drives 20% of Sales</a></h3>
<p class="p1">Within 2 weeks of implementing, multiple BigCommerce customers are seeing more than 20% of their customers checkout through Amazon Pay. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ShopTalk-Amazon-Handout-2754-6x9-print-booklet-AK.pdf">Here’s what they have to say</a>:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Increased mobile conversion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“By building these integrations with companies like Amazon Pay, BigCommerce provides non-household brands, like me, instant credibility. This equals a clear path to ~5% conversion rates on mobile with over 80% of sales on mobile.” – Brandon Chatham, NatoMounts</p>
<p class="p1">“The Amazon Pay button has been great, especially with our mobile device customers. Mobile customers are looking for easier ways to shop and the Amazon Pay button offers that. We’ve seen a considerable gain in mobile-based sales since we’ve implemented it.” – Mark Hawley, Metal Tech 4&#215;4</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Immediate ROI</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“We converted a $2,000 sale in the first couple of hours after implementation, and we are seeing steady usage of the Amazon Pay option.” – Spiro Alafassos, Play Better</p>
<p class="p1">“Amazon Pay was quick and easy to set up on BigCommerce, and after two weeks, 26% of our orders were processed by Amazon Pay.” – Tim Lorang, Power Support International</p>
<p class="p1">“We&#8217;ve seen a 25% increase in transactions coming in from Amazon Pay since implementing the solution.” – Eric Jones, Couture Candy</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Ease of setup</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“The implementation was a breeze with BigCommerce and Amazon working together. It was a seamless process done in short order by a non-technical site owner, i.e., me!” – Mark Hawley, Metal Tech 4&#215;4</p>
<p class="p1">“The implementation process was fairly easy. Now, on any given day, we&#8217;re seeing between 30–50% of all orders choosing to use the Amazon Pay button over other methods of checkout.” – Jeff Jan, Solo Stove</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Reduced friction at checkout</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“The goal of our website is to make it easier for customers to do business with us. The Amazon Pay button allows customers to use their already established Amazon account to make a payment quickly and easily.” – Mark Hawley, Metal Tech 4&#215;4</p>
<p class="p1">“We added the Amazon Pay button to give customers more choice. We know that a lot of people shop on Amazon so it made sense to allow them to use their Amazon-stored info to make purchasing on our site easier.” – Jeff Jan, Solo Stove</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>More trust, fewer errors</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“Amazon Pay gives our customers a recognized and trusted payment option that will help us increase conversions.” – Spiro Alafassos, Play Better</p>
<p class="p1">“Having the address information curated from the customer&#8217;s Amazon account significantly reduces the amount of invalid shipping addresses. When I added that as an option, our shipping people noticed the decrease the next day.” – Chris Bair, Ketochow</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><strong>Improved payment choices</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">“From a branding perspective, we feel Amazon Pay is more appealing than other options and offers a better long-term merchant processing solution.” – Eric Jones, Couture Candy</p>
<p class="p1">“I absolutely recommend Amazon Pay. It&#8217;s the same transactional cost as most other payment processors. Plus, it was simple to set up. I don&#8217;t see a good reason not to do it! More payment options for customers can only be a win.” – Chris Bair, Ketochow</p>
<p class="p1">“It&#8217;s still early, but we think the Amazon Pay option will be very successful for us. We will be promoting the new option on our site, our social platforms, and to our email list. We believe it may become our most used payment option.” – Spiro Alafassos, Play Better</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="2000" height="920" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-hero.png" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-hero.png 2000w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-hero-300x138.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-hero-750x345.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p class="p1">Branding isn&#8217;t a logo. It&#8217;s not your name. It isn’t some meaningless press release out to the world. It&#8217;s more than a strategy laid out in a Google doc.  In fact, branding cannot be seen.</p>
<p class="p1">Branding can only be felt.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about the most amazing companies you have ever interacted with.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Where does that excitement to try on the latest collections <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/flash-tattoos/">Flash Tattoos</a> come from?</li>
<li class="p1">Why do Apple products alleviate stress and allow for a state of delighted bliss?</li>
<li class="p1">What makes you engage with <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/rei-optoutside-campaign-bucks-tradition/">REI’s #OptOutside campaign</a> on Twitter, and like, nothing else?</li>
<li class="p1">How is it that you open every. single. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/man-crates/">Man Crates</a> email they send you, even though no giftable holidays are coming up?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This is branding. This is business mixed with emotion and engagement and expectation. This is mission and customer participation mixed into one. It encompasses your web presence, communications, and products. It&#8217;s baked into your product details, customer emails, and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-checkout-page-optimization/">shopping cart checkout page</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">This is the difference between brands who “get it” and those which don’t.</p>
<p class="p1">Great branding is the most powerful currency a company can have — your single-greatest competitive advantage. People purchase products because of a story, an emotional connection they feel with a brand.</p>
<p class="p1">As ecommerce owners and managers, building a powerful and engaging brand is our most important work. It is a KPI that cannot be put to paper –– but do it right, and every single goal will be surpassed.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Branding is a KPI that cannot be put to paper –– but do it right, and every single goal will be surpassed.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">And yet, so few brands invest early and often in their branding strategy. In fact, it is often an afterthought of success. Something brands get to when they have enough money and time. But you don’t get the opportunity to make a first impression multiple times. How you present your brand across the web matters –– and it matters from day 1.</p>
<p class="p1">The following best practices are going to sound obvious, but it is exactly the obvious that so many *do not* do. So, beyond the typical best practices, I’ll walk you through specific brand examples that stand out above and beyond the crowd.</p>
<p class="p1">This is how you win customers and beat out the overwhelming competition on the web, whether you are just getting started or about to re-brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 class="p3">1. Better serve your customer</h2>
<p class="p1">Always consider who your business is being built for. Remembering the wants and needs of the consumer will dictate your actions as a company and set you on the path of success with your audience.</p>
<p class="p1">If you&#8217;re unsure about who your audience is, you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p class="p1">All too often, many brands forget their audiences and focus on the product or the catalog, potentially missing out on valuable information that can increase sales.</p>
<p class="p1">This can be remedied.</p>
<p class="p1">Take the time to truly reflect on your past purchasers. Look for trends in the analytics and reflect on experiences you&#8217;ve had with your customers.</p>
<p class="p1">Your analytics can be very helpful directionally in helping you understand your customer and their relation to your product and brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Looking at your store’s overview data, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/abandoned-carts/">including abandoned cart data</a>, purchase funnel and most popular products is a great place to start.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20714" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc.png" alt="ecommerce branding" width="640" height="401" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc.png 1126w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc-300x188.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/branding-bc-750x470.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">However, it’s helpful to dive into your customer data even further to really understand their behavior and who they are, enabling you to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/personalized-marketing/">personalize their experience</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Insights-Report">BigCommerce Insights</a> can help you to do this, though other ecommerce analytics platforms may be helpful as well.</p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce Insights cohorts customers for you automatically. You can then export these lists to market specifically to them or to drill down even further into exactly who falls into these categories, what they’ve bought, etc. This segmentation is truly the key to unlocking the potential of your ecommerce brand.</p>

<p class="p1">“We use BigCommerce Insights quite heavily on a day-to-day basis. In fact, it was a key motivator for us going with BigCommerce over Shopify,” says <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/bohemian-traders/">David Berlach, CEO of Bohemian Traders</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1">The Customer cohorts include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Best customers</li>
<li class="p1">Customers at risk</li>
<li class="p1">Viewed by didn’t purchase (both the customer who viewed and the items they didn’t purchase)</li>
<li class="p1">Repeat purchase rate by 30, 60, 90 and 180 days (i.e. 11% of your new customers from December purchased again in 60 days. 3.39% of your new customers from January 2017 purchased again in 30 days, and so on)</li>
<li class="p1">Best full-price customers</li>
<li class="p1">Low AOV customers</li>
<li class="p1">Customer Lifetime Value by 30, 90 and 180 days</li>
<li class="p1">Customer lifetime value by product purchase by day 1, 30, 90 and 180</li>
<li class="p1">Best products for repeat purchase</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In this instance, I want to know which of my customers are sticking around the longest, and which products are helping them to do that. To see that, let’s take a quick look at Best Product for Repeat Purchase.</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>This is the cohort view for those who purchased in December, and again by March.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20673" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights.png" alt="" width="640" height="384" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights.png 1135w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-300x180.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ecommerce-branding-bigcommerce-insights-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>This is the cohort view for those who purchased in January, and again by March.</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What can this data tell you about your customers and your brand?</li>
<li class="p1">Is it that customers buy with you again at the 90 day mark?</li>
<li class="p1">Or, are your customers most often gift-buyers, meaning they drop off in January and don’t repurchase until the next major holiday (maybe Mother’s Day or Father’s Day)?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Those are questions only you can answer, and often, you will need more data to do so. But these analytics point you in the right direction and get you asking the correct questions so you can better serve your customers, increase your revenue and develop your ecommerce brand.</p>
<p class="p1">Use these to look for patterns that clearly point to the heart of your business, that is, why people buy your products.</p>
<p class="p1">Take these buying behaviors and their demographics and reverse engineer your ideal customer.</p>
<h2 class="p3">2. Share your story</h2>
<p class="p1">Tales have been told throughout the history of mankind. As people, we are better suited to remember and emotionally connect with others through storytelling than any other medium.</p>
<p class="p1">You must tell the story of your brand, and you must tell it in a way that builds trust with prospective customers and allows them a glimpse into the oft hidden life of your business.</p>
<p class="p1">So, tell your start-up story!</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Why do you exist? Seriously, why are you even in business?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">There are hundreds of thousands of online businesses. Why should someone choose to give you their money?</p>
<p class="p1">Those are serious questions –– and every single new customer on your ecommerce site is going to be asking them. Sure, some products may make them fall in love and win their conversion long before they care about who you are, but for the most part, customers want to know you. Just like you want to know them.</p>
<p class="p1">So, tell them!</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Call out why you started the business</li>
<li class="p1">Who you are</li>
<li class="p1">What you care about</li>
<li class="p1">What you stand for</li>
<li class="p1">Why you stand for it</li>
<li class="p1">Anything else that matters</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Here are a few good examples of brand storytelling in action:</p>

<h2 class="p3">3. Champion change</h2>
<p class="p1">What does your company stand for? Every brand is built around a certain set of ideals. Convey these to the world. Customers should understand your brand promise – and why it matters.</p>
<p class="p1">Build a following of faithful fans dedicated your cause. People will join in the fight when they find a vision which matches their own and will associate your company with the efforts of hope.</p>
<p class="p1">Be sure to champion this change not just on your About Us page, but absolutely everywhere. This is part of your brand.</p>

<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">4. Extreme expectations</h2>
<p class="p1">Never over-promise on your company. People absolutely hate disappointment. You do not want your ecommerce branding to be associated with false promises.</p>
<p class="p1">Creating an untenable situation where you promise more than you can always deliver will alienate your audience and destroy the trust you worked so ardently to attain.</p>
<p class="p1">This is most noticeable in return and shipping policies. Here, be honest and forthright about your capabilities. You might not be able to do Amazon-like speed, but honesty will take you much further than a negative review.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, your return and shipping policies don’t need to be fancy. They just need to be clear and honest.</p>

<p class="p1">Including a Q&amp;A section on your return and shipping policy page helps to address any additional or common customer questions (and provide relief from calls). It is also good for SEO, helping your brand to rank higher in search results — and helping your customers answer the questions that may be preventing them from pulling the trigger on a purchase.</p>

<h2 class="p3">5. Define your market, and focus exclusively on them</h2>
<p class="p1">This is possibly the most powerful of all pieces of branding. By tailoring your solution, messaging and marketing to your customer, you instantly eliminate the hassle and heartache of pleasing all.</p>
<p class="p1">This means, again, that you need to define your market and then speak to that market in a way that resonates with them. Develop your brand persona and understand <em>who</em> they are — and are not.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/target-market-analysis/">Not everyone is your target market</a>, and not everyone needs to like your messaging. It is important only that it resonates with your target audience.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are a couple of examples.</p>
<h3 class="p6"><a href="https://www.ninelineapparel.com/">Nine Line’s</a> Patriotic Stance</h3>
<p class="p1">First things first, to pull off a great brand, you need to honestly believe in that brand and likely live that lifestyle yourself. Nine Line is a great example of this. The founder is a veteran, hires veterans and speak directly to veterans and other folks who identify as patriotic. The brand awareness practically takes care of itself with such a defined audience.</p>
<p class="p1">This messaging is clear throughout the entire website, and their footprint across the web. It is resonating even in their philanthropic arm, where they support wounded veterans and provide monetary support for medical needs.</p>
<p class="p1">And clearly, this works. Nine Line is one of the top 5 fastest growing retailers in the U.S., according to Inc. magazine.</p>

<p class="p1">What challenges do you, the customer, face?</p>
<p class="p1">Use that questions to figure out how you can build trust and truly add value to their lives. With a narrow view of your target market, this becomes infinitely easier and more successful.</p>

<p class="p1">The key to great branding is knowing how your customers view you compared to the competition. This is more commonly known as positioning.</p>
<p class="p1">From there, you can create a value statement that demonstrates how you are different.</p>
<p class="p1">A simple formula you can use is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I help (target audience) solve (burning pain) by (your solution).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">For example, my agency&#8217;s statement is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;I help ecommerce entrepreneurs connect with influencers so they can rapidly grow their business together.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="p1">Branding is not about a fancy logo or colors. It is actually what people think after seeing or interacting with your brand.</p>
<p class="p1">In order to drive a positive perception about your brand, you need to focus on driving in consistent benefits in pre-purchase marketing and over-deliver on customer experience.</p>
<p class="p1">This will enable you build a core customer base of raving fans for your brand.</p>

<p class="p1">Be consistent. An ecommerce site should be built in accordance with a brand’s brand standards guide. If a brand doesn’t have one, that’s the first place they should start.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not just the site colors and the logo, either.</p>
<p class="p1">Brands must be consistent in the tone of their copy and the overall user experience of the site. For example, if a brand touts its customer service in its messaging, a thousand word dissertation as a return policy for the site isn’t consistent with that.</p>

<p class="p1">With so many ecommerce brands out there offering similar or identical products, customers have increasing expectations. A brand with a strong ‘why’ provides consumers something to believe in. A by-product of belief is loyalty from customers, which gives you the competitive edge.</p>
<p class="p1">Branding isn’t just about an identity or logo &#8211; it’s your marketing messages, your tone-of-voice, how you present yourselves, how you deliver and respond to your customers, and much more. It is the mental picture your customers visualise of your company and whether or not it resonates with them.</p>
<p class="p1">From our experience, the No.1 peice of advice for ecommerce businesses in regards to branding is to ‘stay true’.</p>
<p class="p1">You will have this brand (hopefully) for many, many years. You can evolve, scale, innovate and harness new technology, but staying true with what you stand for as a brand will support your internal vision and external perceptions, increase customer following and loyalty, and help make the right decisions much quicker.</p>

<p class="p1">A brand is a wonderful cocktail of your reputation mixed with the gut feel someone has about your company, products or even its founders. To shape your brand, it means focusing not on just information, but appealing to site visitors emotions.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are two tools to shape how people think about you are Meaning and Story:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Is there something meaningful you can express?</li>
<li class="p1">Is there a backstory or an aspirational feeling you can provide quickly that will wrap your offering in an aura much larger than a simple ecommerce transaction?</li>

<p class="p1">Visual Identity is one of the most important aspects of the front-facing commerce business. Without clear direction on visual styling, typography, font selection, or color use, the brand begins to create confusion without even realizing it.</p>
<p class="p1">Leverage an expert in this process, as design and branding are tightly wound with psychology. Understanding the target demographic, as well as customer intention, can help focus designers on creating memorable visual experiences; and that recognition can last a lifetime.</p>
<p class="p1">Remember, customers always buy with their eyes first!</p>

<p class="p1">Create an experience. Millennials are more brand loyal than you think, but they expect more than just advertising to keep their interest. If you can’t provide value outside of your product offering, you won’t keep their attention.</p>
<p class="p1">Drive engagement with content that adds value to their day and supports the lifestyle your brand represents. Video/UGC/tutorials/lifestyle articles –– it all add value and support your brand’s image.</p>
<p class="p1">Keeping the attention and subsequently, the conversions, of the largest consumer group is no longer just “nice to have,” it is a necessity if brands are going to compete.</p>

<p class="p1">Don&#8217;t brand yourself a certain way because the &#8220;Hippo&#8221; likes it. Brand it that way because you&#8217;ve done actual research into the competitive market space.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Are you the cost-effective option?</li>
<li class="p1">The best customer service?</li>
<li class="p1">Boutique niche?</li>

<p class="p1">Look at a handful of random ecommerce website’s &#8216;About Us&#8217; pages.</p>
<p class="p1">Too many business (B2B and B2C included) talk about how they want to be &#8216;the best&#8217; or &#8216;treat their customers like royalty&#8217;, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">But what is it that they do? What do they sell?</p>

<p class="p1">Branding is where everything is decided. The feeling that you communicate, the audience that will respond to your incentives, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">Therefore, my main advice here is to know your audience well. Know what excites them, what values they treasure. Do market research, collect data, see what your competitors do and how you can be different.</p>
<p class="p1">And do that again, and again and again. That’s how you’ll stay ahead.</p>

<p class="p1">Invest in design and brand identity. A few years ago, if you had a basic ecommerce website it was enough to start a business.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, the bar is way higher, and the standard is to have a very clean design and a strong identity.</p>

<p class="p1">Brand names are not &#8220;established&#8221; in a day. It requires a lot of strategic marketing and promotions, before the brand name becomes recognized.</p>
<p class="p1">Ecommerce businesses should not leave out any avenue for promoting their brand. Social media is a very strong avenue these days to make or break a brand. Promote your products on the social, keep your target audience &#8220;engaged&#8221; and follow up sales with strong customer support.</p>
<p class="p1">The brand becomes bigger through &#8220;word of mouth&#8221; also in the ecommerce age. Here are a few tips to help you along:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Keep the message simple.</strong> It should be easy to understand, effortless comprehension</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Use hashtags.</strong> This allows prospective followers / buyers can “find” your products easily, and with time can become loyal to your brand. Eg: #handmadegifts / #glassjewellery / #pearlnecklace / #giftsforher / #exquisitexmasornaments could be few suggestions for a shop selling handmade glass ornaments targeted at female buying audience</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Design a communication strategy</strong>, and follow it! Brands are established over a period of time –– and a plan will help you to march closer to that date in the future.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Invest in images</strong>. Images get more views in any media, and increase the chances of traffic directing to your estore, building brand recognition.</li>

<p class="p1">Serious ecommerce businesses have to build branding to create brand loyalty in order to acquire brand equity and attract a bunch of money.</p>
<p class="p1">Whether it is a traditional business or today&#8217;s ecommerce brands, the most valuable asset for building a branding are visual. Visuals include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">logo</li>
<li class="p1">colors</li>
<li class="p1">fonts</li>
<li class="p1">photos</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">The human brain processes images and remembers them forever. Brands can use photos to create the right image of their brands in their consumers&#8217; minds. Investing on building the visual assets, especially photos, will pay off in terms of branding and faster than any other investment made on the textual brand strategy.</p>

<p class="p1">Make sure you invest the time in cultivating your brand. In the end, it should be something you are proud of. If you show quality and pride in your brand, then that will reflect to the customer.</p>

<p class="p1">Develop more than a brand. Craft a worldview for your company, including a set of values, commercial goals, and social interests, and infuse all content and communications with this worldview.</p>
<p class="p1">Then identify a circle of influencers in line with that worldview and see what brands impact their social outreach. It never hurts to see what the successful brands do right, then model your efforts after theirs.</p>

<p class="p1">Spend the time and the money to develop your brand. With Amazon selling virtually everything, you need to have a value proposition and brand message that stands out and gives a customer a reason to go through the hassle of ordering from you instead of a one-click Amazon purchase.</p>

<p class="p1">The #1 piece of advice for ecommerce business in regards to branding is to have a cohesive look all across your social media platforms and blog.</p>
<p class="p1">As tempting as it can be to post that puppy picture, if it’s not relevant to your niche don&#8217;t post it.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">Building a truly great brand and creating a close relationship with the target customer is an art in and of itself. This crucial piece of the ecommerce puzzle is what separates the “haves and have nots” in the industry.</p>

<p class="p1">By all the most recent reports, analysts have forecasted that global B2B ecommerce revenue <a href="https://ww2.frost.com/news/press-releases/global-b2b-e-commerce-market-will-reach-67-trillion-usd-2020-finds-frost-sullivan/">will top $6.7 trillion by 2020</a>. As of 2014, U.S. B2B ecommerce alone had already surpassed $5 trillion in revenue.</p>

<p class="p1">And yet, as of 2014, only 22% of B2B businesses in the U.S. were selling online.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20324" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista-1.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-statista-1" width="640" height="419" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista-1.png 706w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-statista-1-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">That’s a lot of revenue for less than a quarter of the businesses in the market for it. So, what’s holding B2B businesses up? Well, a few misconceptions might be the culprit to begin with.</p>

<h2 class="p5">B2B Ecommerce Misconceptions</h2>
<h3 class="p6">1. The belief they don’t sell “B2B” (i.e. What is B2B Ecommerce?)<span class="s1"><br />
</span></h3>
<p class="p1">The number one reason many brands say they aren’t <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/sell/b2b/">selling B2B</a> is because they don’t realize they are already doing it. Selling B2B is a variety of things, including:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Wholesale</li>
<li class="p1">Distribution relationships with large or chain retailers</li>
<li class="p1">Selling to organizations (schools, businesses, non-profits)</li>
<li class="p1">Supplier selling to resellers</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">You do not have to be a supplier in order to sell B2B. Many online brands are both B2B and B2C –– and even use their same homepage for each audience, segmenting into customer groups for individual merchant accounts.</p>
<p class="p1">Assurant’s MyWit site is a great example. Assurant launched a business-to-employee ecommerce website with BigCommerce, saw incredible growth and then used that same site to sell B2B and B2C.</p>
<p class="p1">Now, through customer groups, the site is segmented for Assurant employees, wholesalers and regular retail customers.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-assurant.png"><img class="wp-image-20336 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-assurant.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-assurant" width="640" height="977" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-assurant.png 1317w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-assurant-300x458.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-assurant-750x1145.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">That said, many B2B sellers are indeed suppliers –– but that isn’t the only type of B2B business out there.</p>
<h3 class="p6">2. The belief B2B customers don’t want to order online</h3>
<p class="p1">As the new generation comes to managerial and purchasing power age, their preferred method of purchasing (ecommerce) will surpass older processes.</p>
<p class="p1">In general, <a href="http://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2014/12/05/new-report-b2b-buyers-are-consumers-too/">B2B customers want to see their B2C conveniences transfer over</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">72% of B2B customers want self-service access to accounts and orders</li>
<li class="p1">64% of B2B customers want scheduled deliveries</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">3. The belief ecommerce requires price transparency.</h3>
<p class="p1">With low margins and fierce competitors looking to underbid a B2B business, many brands don’t want their prices available to the public.</p>
<p class="p1">This safeguarding of the supply chain is understandable –- and it’s why many ecommerce solutions offer price availability only after a customer logs in.</p>
<p class="p1">This means only your customers see the prices –– and that prices can be presented exactly as negotiated for individual customers.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20351" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1" width="640" height="301" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1.png 1123w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1-300x141.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-1-750x353.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">You can also use your site to enable product visibility, but require customers who are not logged in to their customer groups (likely a prospect) to call in to get prices.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-availability.png"><img class="wp-image-20337 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-availability.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-availability" width="640" height="185" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-availability.png 1132w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-availability-300x87.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-availability-750x217.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p6">4. The belief online ordering is cold.</h3>
<p class="p1">One of the best ways to make sure a customer doesn’t go to a competitor is by building a long-term, personal relationship with them. This is why so many B2B businesses are family-owned and operated. There’s a personal touch to being one of the family: phone calls, dinners, visits and trips.</p>
<p class="p1">An online store can seem cold in comparison, but it doesn’t have to be. With 24/7 chat technology that can turn an online chat on your store into a text on your phone, the new generation can communicate efficiently and effectively in their preferred communication channel: text, Facebook messenger or a variety of other options.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, this type of customer service is not only easy to set up, it is highly desired by customers across the board.</p>
<p class="p1">See how JMC Automotive Equipment uses chat as well as a highly visible phone number to drive conversions on their site.</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20338" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-jmc-equipment-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p6">5. The belief an online store negates custom ordering.</h3>
<p class="p1">With B2B customers and wholesalers, the possibility for custom orders is much higher than for a B2C site. And for many B2B businesses, they want to provide for the custom order (which helps with that personal relationship). But custom orders aren’t often an ecommerce norm –- or so many people think.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks to custom quoting tools, unique variants and segmented customer groups, B2B businesses can allow customers to send in a PDF quote 24/7, then evaluate the quote and get back within regular business hours on if the unique order can be filled. If it can, the business can place that customer in their own unique customer group so that next time they order, they won’t have to go through the quote engine.

<p class="p1">No matter what your hesitation is to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/b2b-ecommerce-solution/">launching your B2B ecommerce store</a>, know this: nothing needed for a B2B business to prosper online cannot be done.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Have customers who need bulk ordering? <strong>Done.</strong></li>
<li class="p1">Have customers who need specific sizes or materials? <strong>Check. </strong></li>
<li class="p1">Have customers with on-going accounts or pre-negotiated rates? <strong>Taken care of.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">It’s time for your business to take a pie of the $6.7 trillion dollar pie. Here’s how to market to your B2B customers to grow your online sales, streamline your business and focus on what you do best: getting product into the hands of your customers.</p>
<h2 class="p5">B2B Ecommerce Marketing 101</h2>
<div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Trending Topics in B2B Ecommerce</h3></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gorillagroup.com/trending/">Keep your finger on the pulse of the B2B ecommerce industry with trending topics and insights from Gorilla Group.</a></p>
<p></div>
<h3 class="p6">1.Educate customers on products, features, and promotions</h3>
<p class="p6">The concept of an online strategy interweaving content and commerce has a very practical application. If a user is not presented with all of the information –– from sizing charts, to ingredient lists, to how-to guides –– they will seek it elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p1">That exploration often results in the consumer entering another purchasing funnel outside your organization’s digital commerce channel. B2B user experiences have transformed from green screen-like portals with limited information into educational avenues that push product and promotions to your buyers.</p>
<p class="p1">Why? Because this is the way the online value ladder works.</p>
<p class="p1">You prove your value to customers for free through educational content, and then you close the deal once they trust you. Companies using a B2B business model have long done this with conversations over phone or drinks. Now, you need to do it to drive traffic and close sales online.</p>
<p class="p1">A great example of how this can be done is over on Bright Agrotech’s site. Bright Agrotech sells to both established and aspiring farmers –– and they provide all possible education to help customers at each stage of their farming business to succeed.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20340" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech" width="640" height="1025" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech.png 1237w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech-300x481.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-tech-750x1202.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">This is only a small subset of all the educational material Bright Agrotech offers. For any offers that are free, of which they have many, the team puts the content behind a gate to drive email leads which they can nurture into customers.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20341" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro" width="640" height="314" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-300x147.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-bright-agro-750x368.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p6">2. Migrate customers from offline to online channels</h3>
<p class="p6">The number of B2B customers that prefer to speak to a sales rep in person or using phone, fax, or even email will continue to decrease at a rapid pace as Millennial buyers gain more decision-making and purchasing power within their organizations.</p>
<p class="p1">Forrester Research estimates that<a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/andy_hoar/15-04-14-death_of_a_b2b_salesman"> 93% of B2B buyers prefer to buy online</a> when they’ve already decided what to buy.</p>
<p class="p1">If your team is implementing a new ecommerce channel, be sure to communicate early and often with your customers. Some companies have been successful in inviting their core customers into beta testing to train, educate, and gain valuable feedback.</p>
<p class="p1">Regardless of how you introduce the digital channel, anticipate questions and concerns, and, most importantly, highlight the benefits of migrating to the new platform.</p>
<p class="p1">Create FAQs, how-to guides, and interactive navigations to ensure customers can use the platform efficiently.</p>
<p class="p1">The Knobs Co does this well by pointing B2B customers to a dedicated landing page from the homepage and clearly stating the benefits of their online purchasing program.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20345" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-knobs-co-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><em>Screenshot 3</em></p>
<p class="p1">A few things The Knobs Co does really well:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>On Screenshot 1:</strong> Information describing what those who fill out the form can expect, from customer service to quality of the product.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>On Screenshot 2:</strong> A dedicated form to drive leads so they can immediately contact anyone interested.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>On Screenshot 3:</strong> Additional resources at the end of the page so customers can browse other areas if they aren’t yet ready to buy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p6">3. Use technology to solve ongoing customer challenges</h3>
<p class="p6">One very large B2B Manufacturer in the Food &amp; Beverage industry used ecommerce to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/migrations/">migrate</a> to customer self-service, and was able to decrease error rates by more than 80%.</p>
<p class="p1">B2B fulfillment errors are typically exponentially greater than those associated with B2C or direct-to-consumer shopping, due to the nature of the type and quantities of product ordered.</p>
<p class="p1">Mistakes can result in truck or trainloads of product being impacted. In addition to the obvious bottom line impacts, the Food &amp; Beverage company was able to consistently deliver the right products on time while meeting expectations.</p>
<p class="p1">Instead of dealing with customer service challenges, refunds, and apologies, the company has been able to develop new relationships and introduce ancillary services.</p>
<p class="p1">So, how did they do it? It’s about visibility.</p>
<p class="p7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Automatic Inventory Management from a Customer Viewpoint</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Setup rules to alert customers to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/inventory-count/">inventory counts</a> and show out of stock without having to do a single thing.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20346" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings" width="640" height="373" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings.png 1155w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings-300x175.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-inventory-settings-750x437.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p7"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Order Dashboard Visibility for the Fulfillment Team</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">A clear order dashboard is available for your fulfillment teams. You can also use APIs to send order information to an ERP for a real-time sync.</p>
<p class="p1">From this view, you can also clearly see the fulfillment process –– what has been sent out, what is pending and why.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20347" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1.png" alt="b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1" width="640" height="381" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1.png 1135w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1-300x179.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerceorder-view-1-750x447.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Further, beyond an orders dashboard, you can drill into each individual order to see fulfillment stage, order details, PO numbers and more.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-view.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20348" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-view.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-order-view" width="640" height="410" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-view.png 1143w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-view-300x192.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-view-750x480.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">To see how all of that looks on the front end, <a href="https://www.restaurantware.com/">go ahead and visit Restaurantware’s website. </a></p>
<h3 class="p6">4. Roll out programs that spur loyalty, higher order values, and increased purchasing frequency</h3>
<p class="p6">After the platform has been deployed, look to other initiatives to continually turn the needle.</p>
<p class="p1">Likely, if you are a B2B organization, you supply products that are consumable or will need to be continually maintained and replaced. Allowing for both subscription-based and traditional one-off purchases can lock in buyers, yield higher customer lifetime values, and simplify doing business.</p>
<p class="p1">Furthermore, the data can empower your sales team to present and offer complementary products, as well as understand when a customer might be ready to buy.</p>
<p class="p1">Industry behemoth Amazon has already begun to implement these programs. For instance, certain products, such as this air filter, can be purchased in regular (monthly) increments.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20349" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-amazon-example-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">On your own ecommerce store, you can use integrations with partners like Rebilla to manage <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/rebillia-saved-credit-cards/">saved credit card information</a> for individual customers, or <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/recurring-payments-invoicing-by-paywhirl/">PayWhirl for recurring billing. </a></p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-recurring.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20350" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-recurring.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-recurring" width="640" height="334" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-recurring.png 1440w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-recurring-300x156.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-recurring-750x391.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>Example of a recurring billing option on a BigCommerce store.</em></p>
<h3 class="p6">5. Align business processes and teams to scale</h3>
<p class="p6">Organizations often find themselves working inefficiently due to resources being in the wrong roles, or process silos that negatively impact momentum.</p>
<p class="p1">These obstacles occur either because the digital channel was built as an ‘add-on,’ and not cohesively structured within the organization, or because organic decisions over time have morphed into a structure (i.e. solely Marketing or IT “owning” the ecommerce software) that no longer has an effective foundation for cross channel cohesive growth.</p>
<p class="p1">Review your current organizational structure. Re-align your roles and resources. If need be, look outside the organization and hire. Once that structure is in place, have a charter over budgeting and management decisions that impact this digital team.</p>
<h3 class="p6">6. Reduce back-office costs and sunset legacy systems</h3>
<p class="p6">As commerce platforms become more robust in functionality beyond just a “shopping cart,” their reach and influence within a company’s existing technology landscape is widening.</p>
<p class="p1">Lines of traditional applications are blurring as large software companies are acquiring and integrating smaller, specialized software at a rapid pace.</p>
<p class="p1">When undergoing a digital commerce initiative, it is important to understand the selected commerce technology platform’s roadmap and what that signifies in terms of capabilities. This knowledge could allow you to trim license and maintenance costs on overlapping technology and reduce technical bloat.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How to Find a Company’s Road Map</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Because of competition, many ecommerce platforms do not release their road maps publicly. BigCommerce customers can join in <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/meet-new-bigcommerce-community/">on monthly Town Halls to get updates</a>. For prospects, it is wise to <a href="https://partners.bigcommerce.com/directory/search?f0=Partner+Tier&amp;f0v0=Elite">talk to partner agencies which are experts in the B2B space</a>, like Gorilla Group. They will direct you to the ecommerce platform right for your business and explain how all of your needs will be built-in on budget.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p6">7. Ensure ecommerce complements all other sales channels</h3>
<p class="p6">Internal Channel Conflict is a common a pain point for B2B organizations. With industry analysts predicting the demise of the B2B salesman, the online channel is recognized as a legitimate threat.</p>
<p class="p1">Organizations that successfully overcome internal anxiety communicate early and often with the individuals that could be affected. The digital teams, alongside sales leadership, should showcase the benefits of customers leveraging technology-based customer self-service and how it can actually help sales members retire and exceed quotas.</p>
<p>For example, in the telecommunication space, B2C-like ecommerce sites often exist for SBMs to order hardware, upgrade their plans or increase their services. Only if and when that customer becomes complex does an actual sales representative take over the account. This approach allows the team to focus more on selling and less on order taking.</p>
<p class="p1">See here how <a href="http://www.nutreevit.com/">NutreeVit </a>follows this approach. They offer a subscription model for self-service customers, and allow for support outreach or a customer portal in order to upsell or cross-sale customers as needed. There is also a clear Chat Box in the lower right-hand corner.vu</p>
<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SuperGreens-Energy-Immune-Booster.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20428" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SuperGreens-Energy-Immune-Booster.png" alt="SuperGreens Energy Immune Booster" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SuperGreens-Energy-Immune-Booster.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SuperGreens-Energy-Immune-Booster-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SuperGreens-Energy-Immune-Booster-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<h3 class="p6">8. Creating Value for the Human Side of the Transaction</h3>
<p class="p1">Usability is an essential element in creating value for customers. This does not necessarily mean creating “consumer-like” ecommerce experiences centered on visual and interactive elements. Instead, focus on factors like:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Site performance</li>
<li class="p1">Robust search, i.e. faceted search</li>
<li class="p1">An efficient purchasing funnel</li>
<li class="p1">Detailed product content</li>
<li class="p1">Simplified checkout to create a “business-like” commerce experience</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Check out BuySwings.com’s simplified checkout process that enables various B2B checkout functionalities not seen on B2C sites.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Usability also means empowering customers to take control and complete goals on their terms.</strong> Including responsive design as part of the ecommerce software frees customers to research, complete transactions, and manage their accounts, regardless of device.

<p class="p1">In terms of engagement, migrating customers to the ecommerce channel should not come at the expense of creating deeper customer relationships.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Enable customer service integration</strong> to provide customer service agents with a complete view of the ecommerce system, allowing them to resolve issues in real-time, and act consultatively to recommend cross-sells and upsells when appropriate.</p>

<p class="p1">B2B customers don’t necessarily interact with the website in the same way consumers do, yet it is important to educate customers and present them with highly relevant information about new products, services, and promotions. Offer targeted content in places it will be seen, like order confirmation pages and within the My Account section.</p>

<h3 class="p6">9. Creating Value for the Business Side of the Transaction</h3>
<p class="p1">No two customers are the same. Customize the ecommerce channel to cater to the way they do business and become an indispensable business partner.</p>
<p class="p1">This starts by building one-to-one relationships. Use segmentation to present customer-specific catalogs and pricing, as well as introduce incentive programs that reward customers for loyalty and the volume of business they transact.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20333" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups" width="640" height="311" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups.png 1127w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-300x146.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-customer-groups-750x365.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Then, develop workflows that align the ecommerce ecosystem with the way your customers do business to remove any friction from the process.</p>
<p class="p1">For instance, if customers require a multi-step order approval process, the underlying ecommerce platform should be built to support this. On many ecommerce platforms, this is done with a Quoting tool.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is what an on-site quote builder looks like for your customers.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20339" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-300x158.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-750x396.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Here is what you see on the backend.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru.png"><img class="wp-image-20322 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru" width="640" height="308" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru.png 853w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru-300x145.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-quote-ninja-walk-thru-750x361.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">The same goes for payments. From enabling Purchase Orders, to checking credit availability and enforcing purchasing thresholds, ensure the ecommerce system conforms to customer needs.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>For wholesale brands which need customer financing options</strong>, look for ecommerce platforms that integrate with Klarna and AfterPay.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-financing.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20334" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-financing.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-financing" width="640" height="663" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-financing.png 1422w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-financing-300x311.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-financing-750x777.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Keep customers in the loop by being transparent with data. Proactively notify customers of backordered items and low inventory counts for products they purchase to minimize any potential disruption to their business.</p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce automatically emails customers their invoices when an item is ordered and a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/ecommerce-shipping/">shipping</a> update when it is shipped out. Merchants can use the Orders channel on the BigCommerce backend to dive into any specific area, resend invoices, manage returns and refunds, etc.</p>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-info.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20335" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-info.png" alt="b2b-ecommerce-order-info" width="640" height="329" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-info.png 1128w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-info-300x154.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/b2b-ecommerce-order-info-750x385.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And though it’s only applicable in a subset of B2B use cases, enabling punchout to allow catalog feeds and ordering directly through the customer’s procurement system can make the ecommerce channel a powerful tool for building lasting value. That’s why BigCommerce integrates with hundreds of ERP systems, syncing information back and forth in real-time.</p>
<h2 class="p1">25 Experts on B2B Marketing and Ecommerce</h2>
<p class="p2">Beyond getting set up as a B2B online seller, it&#8217;s important that you market yourself appropriately as well. There are crucial differentiations between how B2C and B2B customers want to be marketed toward. That said, those differentiations are becoming more and more alike every day.</p>
<p class="p2">It can be hard to keep up pace. We caught up with 25 industry experts to get their take on how B2B brands should market to their customers.</p>

<p class="p3">A 2015 Forrester report by Andy Hoar (&#8220;Death of a B2B Salesman&#8221;) states: &#8220;The data is very clear that B2B buyers now favor do-it-yourself options for researching products and services. By a factor of three to one, B2B buyers want to self-educate versus talk to sales representatives to learn about products and services.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p3">With this shift in preference in mind, use a CRM to capture every customer conversation and review that data often. For example, if you&#8217;re using chat to talk to customers on your website, review your transcripts regularly and look for FAQs. Use this insight to bolster your self-serve help center to make it as useful as possible.</p>

<p class="p3">The customer lifetime value of B2B clients is so high that you need to invest in retaining these clients. Over 50% of your budget should be dedicated to keeping them coming back, since they can have CLVs in the range of thousands of dollars per year.</p>
<p class="p3">Reward them for their patronage and loyalty. Remember that some B2B buyers CANNOT receive gifts due to internal policies, so when you&#8217;re offering rewards give them the option of receiving a discount or a gift.</p>

<p class="p3">Too many B2B vendors still treat websites as a catalog and take orders via phone or fax. Business customers like to access wholesale pricing and volume discount levels online, and many like to purchase online, too. Implement a full cart checkout experience for B2B buyers, complete with freight and volume shipping options.</p>

<p class="p3">Your ecommerce site for wholesale should offer the same level of service you would expect from the traditional method of an account manager on the phone. Consider your customers wants and needs and make it as simple and easy to use as possible.</p>

<p class="p3">Take inspiration from B2C ecommerce, but remember that there are differences. Traditionally, B2C has lead the way for innovation in the ecommerce industry, and B2B sellers can learn a great deal from watching B2C retailers, but the two cannot be treated the same.</p>
<p class="p3">One key difference is that B2B tends to involve longer relationships, both before the initial purchase, and as additional or repeat purchases are made. This can be particularly useful for personalization, as more data can be found with a longer buying cycle, but this may require more attention from a traditional sales team and lead to channel conflicts.</p>

<p class="p3">Segmentation is an essential part of a B2B marketing strategy.

<p class="p3">Whether you&#8217;re B2B or B2C, consumers are expecting the B2C experience in terms of how they interact with your business online. If you think about it, this makes complete sense: your customer experience expectations as a consumer don&#8217;t change when you walk through your business&#8217; front door for a day of B2B buying (or selling).</p>
<p class="p3">Make sure the experience is slick and does not violate any preconceived expectations your consumers might have. And when in doubt, use the Amazon customer experience as a benchmark. After all, this is the benchmark experience many consumer unconsciously compare your customer experience to.</p>

<p class="p3">B2B brands should invest in SEO, as job one is simply being found. Next, make sure your offering is clear and simply organized.

<p class="p3">Make it about the customer. While most brands focus on showcasing their products, pricing and features, what customers really care about isn&#8217;t the what it&#8217;s the WHY.</p>
<p class="p3">There are hundreds of competitors out there competing for your audience, why should they choose you? The key is getting to know your customers, understanding their challenges and telling their story –– not your own.</p>
<p class="p3">Most marketers address their customers as numbers, geographical locations or type of browser and completely forget that behind those browsers and screens are people with real challenges, searching for a solution for their problem.</p>
<p class="p3">Specifically with B2B products, these challenges are usually more in-depth and require a greater sense of understanding. These shoppers aren&#8217;t just buying for themselves, they have a team, a manager and other responsibilities to consider that B2C clients may not have.</p>
<p class="p3">If you understand your customer’s real challenges, concerns and needs, you can optimize your site for them, address those concerns first-hand and build an experience that solves their problems and as a result grow your sales.</p>

<p class="p3">Businesses are still made up of humans, so your messaging still has to be human, too. Don&#8217;t think that because you&#8217;re a &#8220;brand&#8221; you have to sit behind this wall of jargon and distracting design.</p>
<p class="p3">Text emails with personality convert well. Authentic messaging and content still works on B2B. Don&#8217;t sacrifice what makes your brand unique because you think it&#8217;s necessary to do so only because you&#8217;re B2B.</p>

<p class="p3">While B2B buyers are also influenced by branding and vision, more than individual consumers B2B buyers also care about practicality. Make it easy to do business with your brand.</p>
<p class="p3">Logistics can often be an especially tricky topic in B2B, so if you aim to target that segment make sure all your shipping, receiving, accounting and return logistics are in place, streamlined, and well communicated to buyers.</p>

<p class="p3">For B2B businesses, being known as value-additive is critical for sales. First and foremost, value-additive content content ranks well in SEO, which is a huge B2B acquisition channel. Secondly, the buyer’s journey for B2B is different than B2C, and the product will likely go through more vetting. Being associated with value additive content improves your perceived ROI.</p>

<p class="p3">I would recommend abandoning the traditional B2B sales methods. Creating a personal relationship with your customers (business or consumer) has become much more important than a great sales pitch.</p>

<p class="p3">When it comes to B2B sales, the deals are bigger and fewer than B2C sales, so it’s all about making the most of your opportunities. You need to over-deliver on your prospects’ expectations, so they’ll remember you and feel good about teaming up with you.</p>

<p class="p3">The B2B sales process is generally longer and requires multiple marketing touches which means you need to start with leads before you get customers. The best way for B2B businesses to capture more leads is with a lead magnet, also known as gated content. This is a piece of downloadable content that visitors must enter an email to view.</p>
<p class="p3">The most effective lead magnets are relevant to the business and to the content of the landing page. For example, if I&#8217;m selling software for inventory management and a high traffic landing page talks about the big costs associated with inaccurate inventory counts, I&#8217;d present visitors with a guide on how to reduce inventory costs in ecommerce.</p>

<p class="p3">My top piece of advice for brands selling B2B online is to reach their audience with social advocacy. The ROI there is more than any other form of advertisement. The fundamental reason this works is that social advocacy relies on the action and feedback of real people for buying decision. This conversational form of interaction added trust and value to your brand.</p>
<p class="p3">Followers are willing to pay high prices when they see influencing personalities using the product. The investment on social advocacy gets you the currency of trust by your customers.</p>

<p class="p3">Focus on creating a user experience just as powerful as you would expect to have on a B2C-focused web presence. Usability, content, and customer experience are just as important in the B2B environment, as they are within the B2C.</p>
<p class="p3">The key difference is that brands are only recently starting to realize this. Many have successfully pivoted, and are already reaping the rewards.</p>

<p class="p3">Don&#8217;t rely solely on your B2B store. Leverage existing relationships and salespeople to help guide and drive customers through your store. Target existing customers to upsell them through the store with more selection, easier ordering, and increased responsiveness.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p3">All in all, it is a misconception that the ecommerce world cannot support the needs of B2B sellers and brands. It is not a misconception, however, that your brand may not be ready. Be sure to allocate the appropriate funds to your B2B site launch –– including work with partners and agencies to build the unique tools you need.</p>
<p class="p3">Even though you may need to make an investment, the increase in revenue you can potentially expect <em>vastly</em> outweighs this initial expenditure.</p>
<p class="p3">An ecommerce platform like BigCommerce is more than extensible enough for what you need. But like any good investment and growth opportunity, there will be a small capital investment upfront.</p>
<p class="p3">Don’t worry though. Average launch time is three months –– and sales start pouring in immediately.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://designessentials.com/">Design Essentials</a>, a leader in hair care products for women, needed an ecommerce platform and website that would grow with them for the long term. After extensively <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/shopify-plus/">evaluating BigCommerce and Shopify Plus</a>, the team went with BigCommerce citing the platform’s reliability and reputation among leading mid-market retailers as the key factors in the decision.</p>
<p class="p1">“My family started Design Essentials nearly 30 years ago and have no intention of going away anytime soon. We needed an ecommerce platform that had the capability to grow with us long term,” said Sholanda Armstrong, digital marketing director at Design Essentials. “With BigCommerce, we were able to develop a site that’s current, easy-to-navigate, and allows the customer to experience our brand in a way previously not possible.

<p class="p1">Considered one of the largest supplement companies in the market, <a href="https://bpisports.com/">BPI Sports</a> found its initial success by selling through brick-and-mortar retail channels. Today, the company has also launched a highly successful direct-to-consumer channel.</p>

<p class="p1">“Amazon as a business is becoming more of a competitor to some of the brands, and bringing out their own products,” says Emily Ironi, Founder and CEO of The Dairy Fairy. “I find that it’s still critical to have your own retail presence. I have a lot of peers, especially in the baby products industry, their businesses were 100% on Amazon, and now they’re starting to catch up and trying to migrate more of their business to their own websites. Ultimately, you have a lot more control over everything and also your interaction with customers. It’s about finding that perfect balance.”</p>

<p class="p1">“I come from a family of artists, so it is safe to say I have an eye for color. When I started my design process, I wanted to evoke an overall feeling of calm and peace, therefore I choose this color blue,” says Melissa Bamberg, Founder of NodPod. “Next, the logo came about after doodling many months on paper. I wanted the shape to represent the product. Then a name – the nod in Nodpod is to represent sleep, and then pod to represent the shape of the eye mask, as it looks like a pea pod. Once I had my logo, name and color decided upon, I could visualize the design of the website.”</p>

<p class="p1">For ecommerce businesses, there are few better advertising tools and channels out there than Google and Facebook.</p>
<p class="p1">With Google continuing to lead the industry in web (and paid) search,  and Facebook continuing its powerhouse status as first-party data collector –– these two tech giants offer online businesses visibility and targeting that&#8217;s unparalleled elsewhere on the web.</p>
<p class="p1">Whether you are looking to increase brand awareness, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-drive-traffic-convert-customers/">drive net new traffic</a>  or retarget and drive customer loyalty and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-average-order-value/">AOV</a>, Google and Facebook have myriad advertising options available.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, with so much opportunity comes a cost. Visibility isn’t cheap. PPC advertising is equal parts art and science. Earning consistent and cost-effective sales from Google and Facebook isn&#8217;t necessarily easy — but when you get it running smoothly, it pays off big time.</p>
<p class="p1">These channels require on-going optimization to churn out <a href="http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2017/01/2016-google-shopping-performance-across-categories/">return on ad spend at levels of 595%</a> (as seen in the apparel industry for optimized Google Shopping ads) or the 14.2X return on ad spend some companies like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/case-study/spearmint-love/">Spearmint LOVE</a> see on Facebook.</p>
<p class="p1">To help you optimize your Google AdWords and Facebook PPC  advertising campaigns from day one, I sat down with two analysts from <a href="http://www.cpcstrategy.com/">CPC Strategy</a> &#8212; <a href="http://www.cpcstrategy.com/about/team/lewis-brannon/">Lewis Brannon</a> and <a href="http://www.cpcstrategy.com/about/team/jason-bell/">Jason Bell</a> &#8212; who work with Fortune 500 brands to optimize their campaigns on a daily basis. We talk through Google Shopping, Google AdWords and Facebook Prospecting and Retargeting.</p>
<p class="p1">If you want to see more <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-is-roas-calculating-return-on-ad-spend/">ROAS</a> from your advertising efforts, you must heed the advice of these two.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Google Shopping Optimization Tips</h2>
<p class="p1">According to a <a href="http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2017/01/2016-google-shopping-performance-across-categories/">CPC Strategy study</a>,<a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/google-shopping-campaign-tips/"> optimized Google Shopping campaigns</a> in Q4 2016 averages a 542% ROAS. Here’s how that breaks down per vertical:</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q4-Google-Shopping-Data.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20257" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q4-Google-Shopping-Data.jpg" alt="Q4-Google-Shopping-Data" width="640" height="1029" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q4-Google-Shopping-Data.jpg 1874w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q4-Google-Shopping-Data-300x482.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Q4-Google-Shopping-Data-750x1206.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Below is the conversation I had with Lewis and Jason where they explain exactly how they work with retailers to get these results.</p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: What’s your #1 piece of advice for helping retailers optimize their Google Shopping campaigns?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Lewis:</strong> One of the biggest priorities in optimizing Google Shopping –– and what seems to be one of the biggest pain points is getting a feed set up that is accurate, complete and not riddled with a ton of errors.</p>
<p class="p1">The healthier the feed, the better chance you have of solid performance on shop, just because that&#8217;s basically the life blood of your shopping campaigns. Your campaigns can be built out with different types of targeting, but if you only have 5% of your products plugged into an accurate feed, then you&#8217;re obviously not going to see really good results. That&#8217;s a pretty drastic example, but having a healthy feed, I think, is really, really important.</p>
<p class="p1">If you already have a healthy feed, the next priority is understanding ways to optimize that feed for search intent.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Google built the Google Shopping App for BigCommerce</h3></p>
<p class="p1">To alleviate feed issues, Google partnered with BigCommerce to built an app that keeps a retailer’s Google Shopping feed up-to-date with accurate product information. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/google-shopping-app-built-by-google/">Read more about that app here.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: Could you give me a few components of healthy feed?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Lewis:</strong> So the first one is accuracy. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Making sure that pricing is accurate, your URLs are working</strong> –– both from a URL to product, as well as the image.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Your descriptions aren&#8217;t just duplicates of your titles.</strong> I have seen that happen. Instead, you need to optimize titles and descriptions differently to include keywords that are very important or relevant to the product, or even features of the product. That&#8217;s going to help improve your searchability and relevancy on Google Shopping for your products, and improve your click-through rate, cost-per-click and cost-per-acquisition numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">So accuracy is important and so is, from an optimization standpoint, being able to provide data that is complete and relevant to the products.</p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: And that data you provide should take into account search intent, correct?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Lewis:</strong> Yes, your title, description, and product type should mimic a user’s search intent.</p>
<p class="p1">So if you&#8217;re selling, say, Nike shoes, you want to include Nike as a brand in Google Shopping, because that&#8217;s important to a searcher. You also want to include the size of the shoe, for example, because people might be searching for that. The same goes with the the color of the shoe, and the style name of the shoe. Anything that might be important for people searching for that shoe, you want to include.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Your title, description, and product type should mimic a user’s search intent.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">For some people, maybe for that shoe they would search for “Nike weightlifting shoe.” That&#8217;s something that happens. So you want to make sure that “weightlifting shoe” is somewhere in either the title or the description if you&#8217;ve pinpointed that it is a keyword that&#8217;s really relevant. That keyword would actually improve the relevancy of your product in the shopping feed to what someone is searching. Similar to what a keyword would do in your ad copy for text.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> I think the best way to summarize that would be: aligning your product feed attributes with the search queries data.</p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: Where would you suggest people get search query data from?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> There&#8217;s a couple of places.</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1"><strong>Your current text campaign.</strong> If you&#8217;re running a PPC campaign, then you have a clear idea of what keywords are your top performers. That&#8217;s a great place to look. Look at your actual search queries reports in AdWords for both your text and your shopping campaign.</li>
<li class="p1">One that <strong>I also implore users to look at is the site search data in Google Analytics</strong>, if you have <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012264?hl=en">that enabled</a>. This will help you see what people are actually searching on-site.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/on-site-search-data.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20256" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/on-site-search-data.png" alt="on-site-search-data" width="640" height="390" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/on-site-search-data.png 1153w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/on-site-search-data-300x183.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/on-site-search-data-750x457.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><em>BigCommerce Analytics offers on-site search statistics and relevant keyword data out-of-the-box.</em></p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: Is there a particular process or set of tools you guys use to measure optimization lift on campaigns?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> We really just try to benchmark the campaigns when we get in. When we take over an account, we look at the performance of the campaign or campaigns themselves in Google Shopping. Then, we benchmark the performance when we take over.</p>
<p class="p1">Next, we try to optimize the data feed using our standard best practices, which would be all of the housekeeping things we just talked about: making sure that you have relevant titles, descriptions, and categorizations, and making sure you have all of your attributes correct and that they&#8217;re not throwing errors.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Pour over search queries reports and the site search report to figure out what people are actually searching for.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Phase two is really pouring over the search queries reports, and the site search reports, and figuring out what people are actually searching for. Does that or does that not align with how we are currently titling and describing the products in our feed?</p>
<p class="p1">Then, when we make those adjustments, we measure the impact holistically on the performance of the campaign. It’s all just a matter of benchmarking and testing and following up. There&#8217;s no one tool that we use that measures that lift.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Lewis:</strong> We look at it more in terms of understanding the metrics. If we can get a lift in organic search for the brand and are not having to spend as much on ads, we see an actual drop in the CPC.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s an improvement from a relevant standpoint –– both on-site and in the feed itself.</p>
<p class="p1">In general, some of these strategies may cancel a couple others out. So, instead, we like to benchmark performance and check in on paid campaigns holistically to see how they are doing as a whole from one timeframe to another.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Google AdWords PPC StrategiesOptimization Tips</h2>
<p class="p1">In May 2016, Google announced what they are called the biggest update to ad creative since the introduction of AdWords more than 15 years ago: <a href="http://www.cpcstrategy.com/blog/2016/08/the-new-google-expanded-text-ads/">Expanded Text Ads</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">The new Google expanded text ads are similar to standard text ads in a number of ways, but are highlighted by a few key differences:</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Two headline fields instead of one</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/headline-fields.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20261 size-full" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/headline-fields.png" alt="google adwords ppc strategies" width="634" height="158" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/headline-fields.png 634w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/headline-fields-300x75.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The two description lines merging into one field</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/description-lines.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20260" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/description-lines.png" alt="building display retargeting and prospecting campaigns" width="628" height="155" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/description-lines.png 628w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/description-lines-300x74.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The domain of your display URL is now based on final URL domain</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/url-fields.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20259" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/url-fields.png" alt="ppc strategies" width="632" height="155" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/url-fields.png 632w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/url-fields-300x74.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">With a nearly 50% increase in text space, advertisers now have the ability to highlight products or services more extensively than ever before.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is how Lewis and Jason recommend online retailer’s think through their <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/google-adwords-campaign/">Google AdWords strategy</a> for lead generation and selling your products.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Google AdWords Conversion Tracking –– Simplified</h3></p>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce customers can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/google-adwords-product-advertising-and-marketing/">download the one-click app</a> to begin advertising on Google AdWords without having to drop any code for conversion tracking (it’s included in the download).</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: How do these strategies change when you’re looking at Google AdWords instead of Google Shopping?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Lewis:</strong> When we talk about optimizing titles and descriptions, we&#8217;re really only referring to the product data feed, so that is only relevant to Google Shopping.</p>
<p class="p1">But it does align to the way you would think about approaching a text ad optimization for a regular search campaign. Obviously, the lifeblood of text campaigns are the search queries, just like the lifeblood of a shopping campaign is the search query.</p>
<p class="p1">That&#8217;s the most foundational aspect to both Google Shopping and Google Adwords: understanding what people are actually searching for and what&#8217;s triggering your ads currently. It&#8217;s the secret to paid advertising.</p>
<p class="p1">The real difference, though, is that while optimizing titles and descriptions and categorization in the feed is important to improve relevancy for Google Shopping, Google AdWords is more about optimizing the ads and the ad extensions themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">Here it is critical to understand the structure of your campaigns. You need to ask yourself this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Does the structure of your campaigns allow you to capture relevant search queries, or capture relevant searches, and trigger your ads against those searches to provide the searcher with the most relevant information?</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">You can think about optimizing titles and descriptions in the Google Shopping feed the same way you would think about optimizing ad text and ad extensions in Google AdWords.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> And even ad copy, because your feed and that product itself is essentially the ad. There is no creating a text ad like you would in your text campaign. The product page with your product is the ad.</p>
<p class="p1">To take our example from earlier, that Nike shoe, needs to be optimized for search intent queries even in AdWords or text ad form. So, say we optimize it for Nike weightlifting shoe. Then, you need to make sure your landing pages for that product are similar to what you&#8217;re advertising.</p>
<p class="p1">Is this product page or landing page for the Nike weightlifting shoe? Do I have those keywords in the title? Do I have them in the description?</p>
<p class="p1">You do that same type of optimization between both Google Shopping and AdWords to create relevancy between the ad and the page they land on next on your site.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How Google Recommends You Optimize Your AdWords Campaigns</h3></p>
<p class="p1">When Google offers advice, we listen. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/google-adwords-campaign/">Here’s how one Google Shopping executive recommends retailer’s use AdWords.</a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">Google Shopping v. Google AdWords</h2>
<p class="p1">In a budget strapped business, many online retailers are looking to save PPC dollars wherever they can. With Google Shopping and AdWords offering myriad options –– one question came to mind: which one should retailers prioritize?</p>
<p class="p1">The ultimate answer is … Google Shopping.</p>
<p class="p1">But there are plenty of reasons Lewis and Jason recommend retailers continue to use both options simultaneously.</p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: Is there a time that you guys would recommend brands use either Google Shopping or Google AdWords exclusively?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Lewis:</strong> No, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend that. I recommend using both. It really depends on your budget, though, as well as on the performance of the campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1">What we tend to see across the board is that for non-branded or generic type of searches, Google Shopping tends to perform better. It tends to produce a better lead quality.</p>
<p class="p1">If we&#8217;re working with a brand, let&#8217;s say the brand is Brixton, and if someone is including the brand name in their search, then that&#8217;s obviously a search we feel like has a high probability of converting. That should convert well both on text ads and Shopping.</p>
<p class="p1">For non-branded or generic types of searches, where the opportunity is large to actually acquire new traffic, we feel that Google shopping converts better. This is because the ad itself is an image showing a product. It shows a price, and it shows a description. Someone clicking through on that has already vetted the product better than someone that is just clicking on text ads.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">For non-branded or generic type of searches, Google Shopping tends to perform better.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">That’s why we tend to consider Google Shopping a better lead quality. The data from there has shown it to convert better. In general, we rely a little bit more on Google Shopping for a new customer acquisition and generic type searches. We also rely on it for categorical type searches. For instance, someone just searching for “snap back hats.” Anything more generic does better on Google Shopping than Google AdWords.</p>
<p class="p1">That said, you can have really good success with text ads also. We don&#8217;t recommend not running text ads. If we have a client that has a very limited budget and we have to choose, we&#8217;d generally lean toward Google shopping before we would go to text ads. However, if budget is not an issue, we like to run both. Having a shopping ad and a text ad on the page at the same time for a given query is best  because it gives you more real estate. Having both gives you more opportunities to win that click.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> I&#8217;m from the same thought process as Lewis there.</p>
<p class="p1">The major thing I like to call out with Google Shopping is that price is very important because people are seeing the prices of your competitors at the same time. If you have a much higher price, there&#8217;s a higher chance that you&#8217;re not going to get the click and not get a conversion on that product. Of course, I would never say don&#8217;t run Google Shopping campaigns at all. Instead, it’s a matter of adjusting your bids and making sure that you&#8217;re more competitive.</p>
<p class="p1">In terms of Google Shopping versus Google AdWords, as Lewis had mentioned, it’s really based on what their budget looks like. After we understand what their budget looks like, we look at what features they offer their customers. Are they really competitive with pricing or are they more so competitive with an enhanced service offered to their customers?</p>
<p class="p1">What puts them ahead of the pack?</p>
<p class="p1">From that point, we decide where should spend more –– text ads versus Shopping ads –– based on the biggest opportunity for their particular feature set.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Facebook Advertising Optimization Strategies</h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-advertising-guide/">Facebook Advertising</a> is the Holy Grail for many <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-start-online-business/">selling online</a>, including enterprise brands and small businesses. Whether you are still trying to figure it out or have optimized it entirely to drive nearly all of your sales and conversions –– Facebook is powerful, and it isn’t just your gut saying so.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, since 2015, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141028223736-32465457-facebook-q3-call-today-10-things-you-need-to-know-right-now">Facebook Advertising costs have increased 247%</a>. That makes this channel an expensive one to play in. But, the return on ad spend may very well be worth it. After all, a 14.2x ROAS can result in a 12x increase in revenue YoY.</p>

<p class="p1">Here’s what Lewis and Jason have to say about optimizing your Facebook Ads to really attract your target audience.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How Spearmint LOVE Optimized Their Way to 12x Revenue Growth on Facebook</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Everything you need to know about what founders Shari and John Lott did to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-advertising-success-story/">turn Facebook into advertising gold</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: We just did a <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/small-business-sentiment/">survey of about 550 BigCommerce customers</a>, and social advertising is where they see the vast majority of their success and revenue coming from this year –– specifically Facebook. What are some of y&#8217;alls top tips for Facebook advertising?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> We always start with the lowest hanging fruit, or highest conversion campaign, which would be dynamic product ads. They are also known as DPAs, and we try to set those up for all of our clients.</p>
<p class="p1">Every single client that we manage Facebook for is running dynamic product ads. DPAs are just a given because those are based on products that people interact with on your website.</p>
<p class="p1">You can serve the user a specific product ad that is a retargeting of products they&#8217;ve already viewed on your site. Those tend to convert really, really well. That’s my first recommendation.</p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: Facebook is known for its targeting and retargeting capabilities. How do you guys think through that?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> We segment our campaigns based on retargeting and prospecting. We generally have very different measurement criteria for those, but we do standard retargeting with static ads. Those are called website cards and look like a regular Facebook post. We run those as a retargeting ads.</p>
<p class="p1">We also segment audiences in different ways. Speaking generally, we like static banner or static retargeting ads on Facebook for people that just came to a website, but didn&#8217;t interact with any actual product detail pages. That’s one segment. Once they&#8217;ve reached the product detail page, they receive retargeting with a dynamic product ad.</p>
<p class="p1">So we have a couple different tiers of retargeting strategy based on the user’s interaction level with the website.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>The Complete Guide to Advertising on Facebook</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Strategies that work right now to <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/facebook-advertising-guide/">increase ROAS on Facebook</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: Are there any other Facebook advertising options you’ve seen work really well?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> We also love running carousel ads. We found that generally the carousel ads tend to perform pretty well and get good interactions.</p>
<p class="p1">I would say that our point of view is pretty strong on advising advertisers to use those carousel ads.</p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: What about video?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> We don&#8217;t do that much video because most of our clients don&#8217;t have a lot of video assets to use for Facebook. That said, we recommend using video because Facebook is really favoring video. A lot of our clients are trying to ramp up their video efforts on Facebook.</p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: It sounds like all of that is for retargeting purposes. What about if you are trying to reach a new audience?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> That’s the other aspect of Facebook which we find the most interesting because of the accuracy and reliability of the Facebook audience targeting. When you&#8217;re profiling users that you want to reach through Facebook, the options to target people based on their interests, their behaviors, their income level, their education level, is very accurate.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s first party data! Facebook is gathering that information directly from the user, and so it&#8217;s more accurate than other inferences a platform like Google can make about you. This is actual data that the user themselves has put into Facebook. So we know that the audience profiling information is accurate.</p>
<p class="p1">In terms of prospecting, we like to run really specific segmentation of audiences and test out different audiences against each other to see what people are responding to. We also like to utilize carousel ads for prospecting, especially for apparel.</p>
<p class="p1">We work with a lot of apparel brands and lifestyle imagery that really communicates what your brand is all about tends to work really well, as opposed to a very salesy type message. We like to kind of utilize a lot of lifestyle imagery to build brand awareness from Facebook.</p>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: How do you think through measuring success through Facebook Advertising?</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>Facebook Conversion Pixel in One Click</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Installing the Facebook conversion pixel is vitally important to understanding the amount of actual conversions you earn on your site through your Facebook ads. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/facebook-ads-extension/">BigCommerce customers can install a one-click app</a> to install the code without having to touch any code themselves.</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> The challenge is always measurement, because so much of the conversion data that results from activity on Facebook is not trackable directly. Facebook does a pretty good job of capturing views or conversions, but at the same time, you have to look at a more holistic approach.</p>
<p class="p1">We try to measure what we call “brand uplift,” which is looking at the holistic performance across multiple channels, including direct traffic, organic traffic, paid traffic, etc. We try to measure and correlate ebbs and flows in those channels to our efforts on Facebook prospecting. For example, we&#8217;ll look at our budget that we spent one month on Facebook prospecting, reaching new audiences, and try to see what kind of impact that had on our holistic performance. That&#8217;s what we call brand uplift.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">We try to go beyond the directly attributable conversions that Facebook gives you.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">What we are trying to do is to go beyond the directly attributable conversions that Facebook gives you, and that you&#8217;re analytical tool can give you based on tagging. We try to go beyond that and look at a bit more robust attribution picture to analyze the performance of our social media campaigns.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Lewis:</strong> We look at brand uplift for both retargeting and prospecting, but we expect to see much more direct response activity from retargeting.</p>
<p class="p1">With retargeting, we tend to rely much more on the actual channel reporting, like what Facebook and Google can give you in terms of measuring how many actual trackable transactions are coming from campaigns. We tend to look at that first, and the brand uplift metrics are a little bit more secondary.</p>
<p class="p1">With prospecting though, we tend to look at that brand uplift type of metric first. That’s our main metric. When we look at brand uplift, we also look at new visitors.</p>
<p class="p1">For retargeting, we’re looking at the returning visitors segment because we want to see people that have been to our website coming back. We want to know if  our retargeting campaigns doing a good job of driving people back to the website.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<h3 class="p1">BigCommerce: Any final tips for readers?</h3>
<p class="p1"><strong>Jason:</strong> I think the biggest thing that not only Google has been pushing us to look at, but that we&#8217;ve been seeing a lot more success with is not just using your marketing or remarketing list only on Google AdWords. Build out those audiences and add them to all of your campaigns. Bid aggressively on those segments that are higher converting and showing better performance. Really capture the data from users who have already been to your website, or already know your brand, and try to get them to continue to convert.</p>
<p class="p1">Customer lifetime value and lifecycle marketing campaigns are an important part of advertising across Google and Facebook –– and it’s something we’re seeing Google promote more and more.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Lewis:</strong> To follow up on what Jason said, it’s about harnessing the power of audiences in search and shopping to supercharge your campaign performance. Audiences traditionally have been used for retargeting only on Google. And even that has traditionally been display retargeting only.</p>
<p class="p1">But now, there&#8217;s a lot you can do with your audiences within your search campaigns and within your shopping campaigns to optimize your ads toward your target audience, and that can be really powerful.</p>

<p class="p1">In November 2016, Instagram began testing a new &#8216;shoppable&#8217; post format with 20 U.S.-based retail brands, providing consumers the ability to discover and learn more about featured products –– all without leaving Instagram.</p>
<p class="p1">Through the upcoming integration, BigCommerce customers will soon see Instagram as an option in the BigCommerce Channel Manager, allowing you to sync your product catalog with Instagram.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Instagram by the Numbers</h2>
<p class="p1">When it comes to Instagram, ecommerce businesses by and large recommend the platform. Whether you are advertising, building an audience or both – Instagram has fueled hundreds of thousands in sales. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>600M</strong> — Number of monthly active Instagram users. (Source: <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/154506585127/161215-600million">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>400M</strong> — Number of daily active users (Source: <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/4041792-facebook-fb-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">Facebook</a>)
<ul>
<li class="p1">Increased from 300 to 400M in just seven months*</li>
</ul>

<li class="p1"><strong>5X</strong> — Instagram growth rate compared to overall social network usage in the U.S. (Source: <a href="http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/25-amazing-stats-you-need-to-know-about-instagram.html">Inc.</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>25</strong> — Percent more likely it is that Instagram users are in the top income quartile than average Internet users. (<a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/infographic-globalwebindex-messenger/">Source: GlobalWebIndex</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>5M</strong> —  Number of active Instagram business profiles (Source: <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/4041792-facebook-fb-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">Facebook</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>60</strong> — Percent of people who say they discover new products on Instagram (Source:  <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>70</strong> — Percent of users who follow a business on Instagram (Source: <a href="https://business.instagram.com/">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>75</strong> — Percent of users who take an action after seeing a business post (i.e. visit a website, search, shop or tell a friend) (Source: <a href="http://blog.business.instagram.com/post/150771324916/instagram-advertiser-number">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>500,000</strong> — Instagram advertisers (Source: <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/4041792-facebook-fb-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">Facebook</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>150M</strong>— Number of daily active Instagram Stories users just 5 months after launch (Source: <a href="http://blog.business.instagram.com/post/155717870326/business-insights-and-ads-in-stories">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>33</strong> — Percent of the most viewed Instagram Stories come from business accounts (Source: <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started/">Instagram</a>)</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>36</strong> — Percent of B2C brands that consider Instagram to be “very important” or “critical” to their social media marketing, compared to 13% of B2B brands (Source: <a href="http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/25-amazing-stats-you-need-to-know-about-instagram.html">Inc.</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The data above makes it clear that when Instagram launches a new product for its users and business accounts, it gets used. And with a feature that both Instagram users an businesses marketing on Instagram have been asking for (i.e. product links in feeds rather than just the bio) – it is sure to take off.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>RSVP for the Ecommerce Growth Summit</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Will you be in Chicago for IRCE in June? Us, too! We&#8217;re hosting our first annual Ecommerce Growth Summit, featuring keynote presentations from Mike Ditka, NFL Hall of Fame Coach, Jason Boyce, Co-Founder and CEO of Dazadi, an Inc. 5000 brand, and much, much more.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://grow.bigcommerce.com/summit">Register for the Ecommerce Growth Summit in Chicago this June.</a> Hope to see you there!</p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h2 class="p3">How Instagram Shopping Will Work</h2>
<p class="p1">BigCommerce will be one of the first ecommerce platforms to integrate with Instagram. Through the integration, you will be able to build shoppable photos that feature your products, allowing followers (and others!) to discover and browse natively on Instagram, then easily access your online store to complete their purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">Once enabled, up to five products and their prices can be featured in any photo in your feed. To access, users simply click on a product to bring up a detailed view and description of it. From the product details view, shoppers can click a ‘Shop Now’ button to go right to your site and purchase the product, delivering you the most qualified shoppers.</p>

<p class="p1">At launch, only Instagram-approved merchants in the Fashion, Apparel, Jewelry and Beauty/Skincare categories will be able to use the integration. To get started, let us know you are interested, and you will be added to the waitlist for Instagram approval.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is how the process will work:</p>

<li class="p1"><a href="http://www.bigcommerce.com/instagram">Get approved by Instagram</a></li>

<li class="p1">Enable the integration through the BigCommerce Channel Manager</li>
<li class="p1">You’ll see an option to tag products from your product catalog in the Instagram app on iOS or Android</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">The Instagram channel will be available to all eligible BigCommerce businesses starting in Q2 2017. In the meantime, we are working with select customers to test the feature and ensure the best possible experience for our customers.</p>
<p class="p1">For now, brands selling in the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/showcase/clothing/">Fashion, Apparel, Jewelry</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/showcase/health-beauty/">Beauty/Skincare categories</a> should continue to build out their Instagram audiences.</p>
<p class="p1">To help you figure out exactly how to do that, we caught up with a few BigCommerce merchants — each with more than 30,000 Instagram followers — to get their advice on how to build an engaged, passionate Instagram audience.</p>

<h3 class="p5">What is your #1 priority in creating an engaging Instagram business profile?</h3>
<p class="p1">If I had to pick the most important thing, I would say the pictures need to feel genuine. Posts that feel over “photo-shopped” often lack an authenticity that is really critical to connecting with your audience. Find a style that works for you and post often, i.e. 3 to 5 times a day.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What advice would you offer other online businesses looking to grow on Instagram?</h3>
<p class="p1">The most important advice is be very particular about what you post. If your feed lacks a cohesive feel, your audience will have a hard time relating to your content.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you have a clear aesthetic that is resonating with your audience, network with other Instagrammers with a similar size audience. In our early days on Instagram, we did a lot of “friendly follows” with other Instagram accounts that we respected and that were a good fit for our audience.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What has your experience advertising on Instagram been like and what advice would you give to others?</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Instagram is a great organic audience for us and we have run conversion ads using our most engaging posts.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">We have had great results with acquiring new customers through Instagram advertising. Instagram is a great organic audience for us and we have run conversion ads using our most engaging posts.</p>
<p class="p1">Our best advice is experiment thoughtfully. Have a plan for what you are trying to accomplish and come up with goals for each metric you track (engagement, conversions, etc). Review your ads performance frequently while you are perfecting your audience and content.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Instagram has announced upcoming Instagram Shopping features. How do you think letting your customers shop your catalog on Instagram will change your business?</h3>
<p class="p1">We have used a shopp-able Instagram feed for nearly a year now through StoryBox and it has been a good investment for us. That being said, we are really looking forward to using the native shopping functionality for Instagram marketing, as we believe that it will be one more way that we can make purchasing from us easier.</p>
<p class="p1">We have a highly engaged Instagram audience and we are anxious to make our Instagram shopping experience even more seamless.</p>

<h3 class="p5">What are the top priorities in creating an engaging Instagram business profile?</h3>
<p class="p1">There are many things we do to dominate on Instagram. Here are a few:</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1) We post 8-10 times per day, 7 days a week, so there is always fresh content to be seen by our fans.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Some are product images, some are lifestyle shots, some are funny videos. We like to mix it up!</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2) We offer Instagram photo contests and giveaways for customers to win free merchandise or a gift card!</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">A customer has to tag their friends and share one of our contest posts and we will pick a random winner every week! Everybody loves free stuff, so this is always a popular promotion for us.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3)  We ship all items to our customers in a custom poly mailer bag to drive user-generated content.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">The bag has our logo and our own exclusive hashtag for customers to tag us on Instagram when they take a selfie in their new outfit.  If customers post a selfie on Instagram wearing our clothes and tag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/pinklilystyle/">#pinklilystyle</a>, they will be featured on the front page of our website. This has been a great promotion. Customers love the idea of being featured on a website that has 25,000 visitors per day.</p>

<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20229" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-1.png" alt="pink-lily-instagram-1" width="640" height="248" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-1.png 1904w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-1-300x116.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-1-750x291.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4)  We let our customers choose which items we buy.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">When shopping for new items or attending a market, we let the customers &#8216;Be the buyer.&#8217; We take pictures of the items we are considering and then we post them to our social media pages, asking our fans to &#8216;be the buyer&#8217; and let us know what they think about particular items.</p>
<p class="p1">For example we will post a picture holding a dress in each hand and ask the customer &#8216;Which dress do you like best? Left or right?&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">This not only gives us a look at the specific buying habits of our customer, but our fans feel great knowing that we value their input and we try and stock our website based on the items that they truly want.</p>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20231" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-2.png" alt="pink-lily-instagram-2" width="640" height="434" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-2.png 965w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-2-300x203.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pink-lily-instagram-2-750x508.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<h3 class="p5">What advice would you offer other online businesses looking to grow on Instagram?</h3>
<p class="p1">Keep your customers engaged! Ask their opinions, give away items, make them laugh, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">An engaged fan is more likely to turn into a customer. Make sure they know that you value their input and want them to be extremely satisfied with their purchase.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What has your experience advertising on Instagram been like and what advice would you give to others?</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Look at it from the customer’s viewpoint and ask yourself, &#8220;Would I click on this ad?&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">We currently are advertising on Instagram and the results have been positive. It’s all about the image and the message.</p>
<p class="p1">You only have a couple seconds for a customer to decide whether or not they are going to click on that ad.  Make sure you put a lot of thought into what type of picture, wording, design, etc that you will be using. Look at it from the customer’s viewpoint and ask yourself, &#8220;Would I click on this ad?&#8221;</p>
<h3 class="p5">Instagram has announced upcoming Instagram Shopping features. How do you think letting your customers shop your catalog on Instagram will change your business?</h3>
<p class="p1">This is great! We currently use a third-party platform to turn our Instagram feed into shoppable content. It will be nice to be able to do it straight from Instagram and BigCommerce going forward.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Shark Tank Success to Instagram Fandom</h2>
<p class="p4" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grace-and-lace-instagram.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-20225" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grace-and-lace-instagram.png" alt="grace and lace instagram" width="640" height="499" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grace-and-lace-instagram.png 897w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grace-and-lace-instagram-300x234.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/grace-and-lace-instagram-750x584.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">With more than <a href="https://www.instagram.com/graceandlaceco/?hl=en">44,000 Instagram followers</a>, Grace &amp; Lace was skyrocketed to household name when they appeared on Shark Tank. Today, the team uses Instagram to connect with their audience and fans across the country.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is their best advice on how to grow a loyal base.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__recommended" style="background-color:#f6f7f9"><h3>How Grace &amp; Lace Manages Inventory Across Channels</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Selling so much through Instagram and other channels including Facebook and Pinterest can be challenging. <a href="http://www.skuvault.com/resources/casestudies/grace-and-lace">Here’s how the Grace &amp; Lace team figured it all out. </a></p>
<p class="p1"></div></p>
<h3 class="p5">What are the top priorities in creating an engaging Instagram business profile?</h3>
<p class="p1">For us, we work to strike a balance between promoting our products, giving our fans a behind the scenes look at Grace &amp; Lace, sharing my life as a mom, wife, and entrepreneur, and adding a little levity or inspiration to their week.</p>
<p class="p1">We try to build a valuable relationship with our fans so that when they’re ready to buy something they can’t try on first or see in person, they have had positive interactions with our brand online and they trust me and Grace &amp; Lace enough to take that leap of faith.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What advice would you offer other online businesses looking to grow on Instagram?</h3>
<p class="p1">Tell your story. Facts tell, stories sell.</p>
<p class="p1">Successful brands drive engagement with a story or an experience around their products. Stories enable us to create a connection not only with our fans but with a new audience.</p>
<p class="p1">Instagram is a powerhouse for you to visually tell that story and showcase that experience. It’s not about marketing your product; it’s about marketing the experience that comes with owning your product.</p>
<p class="p1">Most products we sell are shot on a mannequin first. We’ve tested and 100% of the time, a model photo, flat lay, or even a selfie photo gets more engagement than a mannequin photo.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s the same product, but a shot of the model walking down the street on a pretty day shows an experience. The flat lay complete with accessories shows an experience. The selfie shows an experience. And don’t get sidelined by ‘the gear’ involved in taking great photos. It’s not about the gear. It’s about connecting people to your story, to the experience, of your company.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What has your experience advertising on Instagram been like and what advice would you give to others?</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Compared to Facebook, Instagram has much less clutter in the newsfeed which makes the ad feel more native and increases engagement.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">Instagram advertising can be powerful and it doesn’t necessarily have to be expensive. Compared to Facebook, Instagram has much less clutter in the newsfeed which makes the ad feel more native and increases engagement.</p>
<p class="p1">The best piece of advice I can offer is to use the targeting to your advantage. Use current shopper data to create the ‘person’ most likely to engage with your ad. If your typical customer is a middle aged woman from the Midwest, target your ad specifically to that type of person so you aren’t showing the same ad to a male college student in Florida who will never buy.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Instagram has announced upcoming Instagram Shopping features. How do you think letting your customers shop your catalog on Instagram will change your business?</h3>
<p class="p1">Instagram shopping is a game changer. Browsing and discovering things you love is very easy on Instagram. Finding more information on those things you love can sometimes be a task, especially on mobile. The more barriers you put between the consumer and your product, the better the chance they will get distracted and move on.</p>
<p class="p1">There are solutions that have bridged the gap well for us, but making that process more fluid will give Grace &amp; Lace fans and prospective fans a more seamless way to engage with our brand. With Instagram shopping we can build on the piqued interest of a potential customer natively through Instagram and help customers move seamlessly from discovery to purchase.</p>

<h2 class="p3">Prepping for a Shoppable Instagram to Drive Sales</h2>
<p class="p3"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nickelandsuede.png"><img class="wp-image-20228 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nickelandsuede.png" alt="nickelandsuede" width="640" height="471" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nickelandsuede.png 944w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nickelandsuede-300x221.png 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nickelandsuede-750x552.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">With more than <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nickelandsuede/">34,000 Instagram followers</a>, Nickel &amp; Suede admits they began on Instagram early –– and have long been awaiting shoppable posts to make Instagram advertising as successful as Facebook’s.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is their best advice on how to grow a large following and advertise effectively.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What are some tactics you’ve used to create an engaging Instagram business profile?</h3>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote"></p>
<p class="p1">Our followers appreciate using IG as a platform where they can get to know us without scouring our website.</p>
<p class="p1"><div class="post-detail__quote-author"></div></div></p>
<p class="p1">When we started Nickel &amp; Suede, Instagram was still growing in popularity and we knew that it was somewhere we needed to have a strong presence. We started off by networking and collaborating with other brands that we related to and that was a big initial boost at a time when users were first creating IG accounts and choosing who to follow.</p>
<p class="p1">We quickly found that the biggest struggle was having enough continually engaging, high-quality content. We&#8217;ve worked hard to create great imagery to share with our followers that is informative and personal. We try to keep our followers updated in real-time with information about new releases, behind the scenes and sneak peeks.</p>
<p class="p1">We also try to think of our audience as “new” every couple of months so we shift to introducing ourselves every so often or sharing little “did you know” bits about us. We think our followers appreciate using IG as a platform where they can get to know us without scouring our website.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What advice would you offer other online businesses looking to grow on Instagram?</h3>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s been interesting to find a balance for our business on a platform like Instagram because most of its users are there and have been there for personal reasons. They want to connect with friends and family there and so finding a way to fit your business into someone&#8217;s personal feed is a hard thing to do.</p>
<p class="p1">So, my advice is first, you have to have great images. Whether you take them with your phone or your camera, make sure they are interesting and high quality. What you say in your caption also matters, but the picture is what sells you.</p>
<p class="p1">Second, I would suggest finding ways to keep the platform personal to your customer. Find ways to make them feel like an insider. Offer behind the scenes shots or share something personal about employees. Don&#8217;t make it all about selling. Instagram users need a personal reason to follow a business.</p>
<p class="p1">That being said, Instagram has been shifting and changing over the last year. It is becoming more like Facebook in that it is slightly less personal and will soon have more ways to boost for businesses.</p>
<p class="p1">Follower growth is slower than ever right now, but we don&#8217;t think it will stay that way. We are sure Instagram will slowly become an even better and better place for businesses to be. And when they start offering more ways to advertise and easier ways to sell through the platform, it will be pay to play. It will be worth it just like it&#8217;s worth it to pay to play on Facebook.</p>
<h3 class="p5">What has your experience advertising on Instagram been like and what advice would you give to others?</h3>
<p class="p1">We are currently advertising on Instagram, but only a little bit. Our Facebook ads run on Instagram as well, but we don&#8217;t see the same kind of conversion on IG as we do on Facebook.</p>
<p class="p1">We think that advertising on Instagram will eventually be very lucrative, but we don&#8217;t have a strategy for that currently. There are still more features we&#8217;d like to see added to allow shopping from Instagram.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Instagram has announced upcoming Instagram Shopping features. How do you think letting your customers shop your catalog on Instagram will change your business?</h3>
<p class="p1">Speaking of adding features, yes, we&#8217;re excited about these! It has previously been so difficult to shop a specific item you see featured on Instagram that I think there is huge anticipation for this. We believe that our customers will really respond well to this feature and we&#8217;ll start seeing many more conversions from IG to our website checkout.</p>

<h2 class="p9">14 Experts on How to Effectively Advertise on Instagram &amp; The Future Possibilities of Instagram Shopping</h2>
<p class="p1">Instagram is a high-engagement platform and more and more brands are looking to it to drive much more than sales –– i.e. customer loyalty and lifetime value. Tracking Instagram ROI, though, can be difficult.</p>

<p class="p1"><img class="size-full wp-image-20250 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/instagram-tara-johnson-1.jpg" alt="instagram-tara-johnson" width="640" height="336" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/instagram-tara-johnson-1.jpg 640w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/instagram-tara-johnson-1-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">A/B Testing will help you nail the right ads and target the right audience to get that coveted leap in conversions.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Instagram Shopping will be useful for online stores. If you think about it, there is an obvious risk if you don’t have a shoppable Instagram. For example, if a customer sees an item they like on the platform, but there&#8217;s way for them to buy the item or link to your site, you risk losing that sale.</p>

<p class="p1">If you want to increase ROI on Instagram – or any channel for that matter – figure out how to use the platform the way consumers use it. If you&#8217;re salesy, people are going hate you. But, you&#8217;re engaging, it will go a long way in terms of bringing you real, lasting customers.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Johnathan Dane, CEO &amp; Founder, <a href="https://klientboost.com/">KlientBoost</a></h3>
<p class="p1"><img class="size-full wp-image-20219 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/instagram-johnathan-dane.jpg" alt="instagram-johnathan-dane" width="640" height="336" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/instagram-johnathan-dane.jpg 640w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/instagram-johnathan-dane-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Just like Facebook, prioritize your audience targeting in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Custom audiences</li>
<li class="p1">Lookalike audiences</li>
<li class="p1">Saved audiences</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">People who know you (custom audiences) are going to usually provide a higher and quicker ROI compared to the people who&#8217;ve never seen you before (saved audiences).</p>
<p class="p1">We try to max out the Instagram audience potential with custom audiences first, then lookalike, and then saved audiences last.</p>
<p class="p1">As we start targeting audiences that are colder and colder, we also focus on changing the call to action to match that audience temperature.</p>
<p class="p1">Someone who hasn&#8217;t of us before won&#8217;t pull out their credit card if our product isn&#8217;t novel, so our best bet is to get them to sign up for something that&#8217;s higher up our funnel.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">If it&#8217;s anything like the success from Google Shopping, then it will be huge, but it won&#8217;t be the same.</p>
<p class="p1">I see this more of a Pinterest-style rollout that will certainly be very interesting to test, but will require stores to rely more on talent of photography and not shopping feeds.</p>
<h3 class="p5">Kunle Campbell, Founder, <a href="https://2xecommerce.com/welcome/">2X Ecommerce</a></h3>
<p class="p1"><img class="size-full wp-image-20211 aligncenter" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/instagram-kunle.jpg" alt="instagram-kunle" width="640" height="336" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/instagram-kunle.jpg 640w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/instagram-kunle-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p class="p1">Besides your visual creative, finding and narrowing down on a highly engaged audience is key to driving success on Instagram. I like to start off with retargeted audiences, then scale up to a lookalike audience of the base retargeted audience and finally use Facebook ads&#8217; demographic and interests targeting to create custom audiences that I split test.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Instagram Shopping will be especially useful for retargeting ads and for shopping cart recovery. I think conversions from impulse purchases by audiences that have just discovered your brand via Instagram will be low. But the big opportunity will likely come from audiences that have initially engaged with ecommerce brands on their websites.</p>

<p class="p1">Experiment with some of the apps that let you tie photos to product pages. This makes Instagram more of a direct path to purchase, which is easier to track and assess ROI.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">The success of Instagram Shopping comes down to their execution. Twitter announced ecommerce years ago and it was a dud. I&#8217;m optimistic here, though, because the medium is so visual. I think they will make impulse priced items a real possibility. Where else today can you really sell an impulse item other than on your own site to your own traffic?</p>

<p class="p1">Use images of real people. It’s super simple, but it has a huge effect on your click-through-rate which in turn increases your relevant score. Also, the more clicks you get, the lower your cost-per-acquisition will be, and thus your return on investment will increase.</p>
<p class="p1">People are gregarious, and we rely heavily on what other people do and tend to follow the crowd. Using images of real people along with your product establishes a more personal relationship between brand and consumer which makes people more inclined to click the ad.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">I really love Instagram shopping. You now have the possibility to show images of your products without having to link to them in your bio. This is a feature I’ve really been looking forward to.</p>
<p class="p1">I used to work as an ecommerce manager at a furniture and interior design ecommerce store, where we would show beautiful images of our products in different environments to illustrate how you could use them. The problem was that people couldn’t just click the image and buy the product. We had to list every single item on the image correctly according to the product name on the website. This quickly becomes a problem if you have many products in one image. Moreover, users had to click the link in our bio, and search for the product on the website and then buy it. That process is way too complicated, and most users will drop off before completing the purchase.</p>
<p class="p1">The new feature allows you to tag your products in the images and then users can click on the product on the image and be sent directly to the product page where they can buy it.</p>
<p class="p1">Instagram advertising now has the potential to become more than just a retargeting platform for ecommerce. You can do push advertising and reach out to cold leads with awesome images of your products in use.</p>
<p class="p1">You should always use images where you show your products in their “natural” environment instead of just showing a simple product image. For instance, if you sell furniture, you should decorate an entire room with different furniture to show how everything goes together, which can also increase additional sales.</p>

<p class="p1">Make it a no-brainer to try it out. If you have a physical product, make it a &#8220;free trial&#8221; where you send a sample and the customer only covers shipping. This works even better if you&#8217;re selling a subscription.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s unlikely someone will make a decision to spend a lot of money based on an Instagram ad, but if you can give them a taste of the product it&#8217;s a lot easier to convince them of the big purchase later on.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">I can&#8217;t speak for their effect on anyone else, but I can say anecdotally that Instagram ads have been far more effective for me than any other social media advertising. I&#8217;ve downloaded something like four apps and bought health supplements because of Instagram ads.</p>
<p class="p1">The easier Instagram can make it to capture both attention and money within the app, the more powerful the service will be for retailers.</p>

<p class="p1">Develop a <a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/instagram-marketing-tips/#tip10">content strategy for Instagram</a> on what you will post, both for organic and paid ads. You should be able to answer what value your audience will receive from you. Will your pictures educate your fans? How so? Will you strive to entertain them? In what ways? Or will you seek to inspire your audience?</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">I believe Instagram Shopping is going to be huge for ecommerce businesses. Pinterest has already proven this to be a successful model. The average order value of sales coming from Pinterest is $50. Thinking about that in terms of Instagram, <a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/instagram-engagement-rate/">Yotpo found</a> Instagram engagement rates were 45% longer than visitors from Facebook, 62% longer than visitors from Pinterest, and 40% longer than visitors from Twitter.</p>

<p class="p1">Pay attention to the trends. There are hashtag days, like #TBT (throwback Thursday) for example, that can help augment the reach of your brand if you leverage the right tags at the right time. But make sure the audience using the tag matches your target audience!</p>
<p class="p1">Doing keyword research on Instagram is absolutely necessary. Don&#8217;t just assume that hashtags from Twitter will be the same conversations on Instagram –– they&#8217;re often very different. Also, make use of the new features Instagram releases, like the recently released scroll function that allows you to use multiple pictures in a set.</p>
<p class="p1">Give your audience exactly all the information they need right in the app itself (including payment processing, if you have items to sell). The more work you make your audience do, the more barriers to buy you&#8217;re unintentionally creating.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Shopping on Instagram as it exists today is a bit cumbersome. Importantly, there&#8217;s one huge barrier to buying: no PayPal integration! This means that users making an often impulsive purchase decision in the Instagram App don&#8217;t have the ability to 1-click-to-buy. Instead, they have to have a physical credit card on them to input during the checkout process.</p>
<p class="p1">A smoother purchase funnel will definitely alleviate this pain point, and lead to a smoother buying process for brands on Instagram selling their goods.</p>

<p class="p1">Share images a user would share. Instagram is an environment where people engage with friends, not brands. Images should not only grab attention, but they should look like they are coming from a real person. No stock photos or produced graphics/charts/logos etc.</p>

<p class="p1">My #1 piece of advice for brands to increase ROI from Instagram ads is making sure to target the right audience. Instagram lets you target by demographics, location, interest, and much more.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">I&#8217;m actually quite excited to try it out for myself. I love how seamlessly integrated it is and how you can showcase the product and price upfront. Many consumers want to know as much about the product before they head to buy. In a world where many people have a short attention span, this HELPS!</p>

<p class="p1">Instagram is all about engagement. The platform gives users a peek into the daily lives (albeit a highly stylized version) of others. So from an advertiser standpoint building engagement means presenting a view into the lifestyle that your brand represents. Your product will resonate if viewers see it fitting into their imagined day to day. The trick is to paint a picture that&#8217;s not too out there, but just a touch more exciting than their current reality.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to retail, especially online, distribution is king. The products with the best and widest distribution models may not always win, but they often have the best odds. Instagram Shopping is yet another highly engaging direct to consumer distribution channel that may prove very fruitful for savvy brands.</p>

<p class="p1">The key to generating more ROI from Instagram ads is to make sure your relevance is backed up by a well curated collection of content that&#8217;s in line with what you&#8217;re promoting. Your ads are designed to summon engagement from a particular group of targeted users so it behooves you to make sure their follow-up actions lead to more engagement either on your Instagram profile, website or maybe even your page feed. Focus your attention not on the ad itself but also the entire lifecycle of the ad.</p>
<p class="p6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On Instagram Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1">Instagram Shopping is yet another reimagining of how retail is evolving and how merchants must adapt their resources to access customers. Instagram Shopping will likely become very successful for established brands with large followings.</p>
<p class="p1">For smaller and less established brands, the process of acquiring followers, adapting the actual store to handle checkout workflows, order abandonments, adjusting the customer lifecycle funnels, and creating enough content to make Instagram Shopping successful still needs proof of concept. For the majority of stores in the marketplace today, Instagram Shopping should hold as a very interesting feature for now.</p>

<p class="p1">Test a micro-conversion on your Instagram landing page. And if you’re not creating a landing page, optimized for mobile, which is unique to your Instagram offer, start there.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you have your LP, the micro conversion has two possible ROI boosting benefits: 1) <a href="https://klientboost.com/cro/online-form/">Data has shown</a> that micro conversions imitate the conversion in a less threatening way and increase overall conversions. 2) If you get a contact method you can remarked to those leads later and potentially boost overall sales.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Final Word</h2>
<p class="p1">All in all, Instagram continues to be a high-growth social platform for many online brands. High-quality imagery and A/B testing of advertising that inspires and engages (rather than just sells) are what take you to the top.</p>
<p class="p1">The Instagram Shopping feature will be a valuable addition to your Instagram arsenal of tools to grow your fanbase and get your products in their hands.</p>
