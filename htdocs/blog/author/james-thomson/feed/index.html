				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Amazon Product Sourcing: Where Do Your Competitors Get Their Products?</h2>
<p class="p1">As you research potential manufacturing partners for your private label business, you can access public import records to see from where your competitors are sourcing their products. Think of this as a shortcut to identifying overseas manufacturing capabilities similar to what you need.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Just because your competitors are using specific overseas manufacturers doesn&#8217;t mean you will be able to get cooperation from the manufacturers to make your products. Keep in mind; these manufacturers may not be able to accommodate your custom design needs. It is a good place to start, however, without having to make a whirlwind trip overseas to identify suitable manufacturers.</p>
<p class="p1"><table id="table_19160200" width="100%" class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Company</th><th>Channel Served</th><th>Phone</th><th>Contact</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
	
	<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
 jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    jQuery('#table_19160200').DataTable( {"destroy": true,"bPaginate": false,"bLengthChange": true,"bFilter": false,"bSort": false,"bInfo": true,"bStateSave": true,"bAutoWidth": true,"sPaginationType": "full_numbers","oLanguage": {

			"sZeroRecords": "Nothing found - sorry",
			"sInfo": "Showing _START_ to _END_ of _TOTAL_ records",

                        "sSearch": "Search: ",

<h2 class="p1">Amazon Price Tracker</h2>
<p class="p1">Realistically, you should install these free tools immediately upon becoming an Amazon seller. By being able to determine listing activity across other sellers on listings you currently have or are considering adding to your catalog, you can gauge likely types of pricing competition you will face. You will also be able to understand whether the product has been sold by Amazon itself.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Remember, it&#8217;s critical to look at historical pricing information so you aren&#8217;t getting a static and potentially misleading picture of competition. For example, you may see the product you&#8217;re aspiring to sell has very little competition only to discover a week later that Amazon itself is selling this product. It was only temporarily out of stock, at which point you will be back to competing head-to-head with Amazon. This is something that may cause you to rethink whether you want to sell that item.</p>
<p class="p1"><table id="table_21387632" width="100%" class="bordered"><thead><tr><th>Company</th><th>Channel Served</th><th>Phone</th><th>Contact</th></tr>

<h2 class="p1">Inventory Scouter</h2>
<p class="p3">If part of your sourcing model includes retail arbitrage, you can save yourself a lot of time by having one of these tools accessible when you walk the aisles of your retail sources. By scanning barcodes to produce instantaneous Amazon product and profitability information, you can quickly establish whether an item makes sense to buy for resale on Amazon.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Most of these tools look only at Amazon fees and your cost of goods sold. You should factor in any indirect and overhead costs  into your decision on whether to buy any of these items for resale. In doing so, you may find that some of the estimated profitable items you&#8217;ve scanned aren&#8217;t profitable and that your time wandering the aisles inspecting product isn&#8217;t, in fact, free. There is real opportunity cost to your time.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Amazon Product Research</h2>
<p class="p3">When you go looking for new products to add to your Amazon catalog, you may find yourself scouring through supplier catalogs or staring at spec sheets. <em>Just how are you making your decisions about what to add?</em></p>
<p class="p3">Are you able to screen hundreds and thousands of prospective products on criteria like Amazon customer demand, Amazon seller competition, the presence of Amazon Retail as one of the competing sellers, margin opportunity, and so on? Without some automated tools, you likely aren’t able to do a deep-dive on most prospective products.</p>
<p class="p3">Fortunately, these product research tools can help accelerate this evaluation process significantly, allowing you to become more efficient and data-driven in your sourcing decisions.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p3">While the line between inventory scouter software and product research software is closing every day, I typically see more types of data in the product research software. But, you have to figure out how to incorporate these additional data points into your decision on whether to source specific items.</p>
<p class="p3">Also, keep in mind that product attractiveness can change very quickly by the introduction of a just one lower-cost competitor, so make a habit of revisiting this information on a regular basis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Amazon Inventory &amp; Order Management Solutions</h2>
<p class="p1">If you are a multi-channel seller, keeping track of your overall inventory levels can get tricky. If you oversell inventory, you upset customers and are on the fast track to getting your Amazon account suspended. And if you undersell, you have lost out on sales. You need to have real-time inventory numbers to manage inventory by channel, giving you the ability to replenish FBA quickly (if required) or place new product orders with your suppliers if you are running out on critical selection.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">There is quite a bit of variation across inventory and order management companies. Some charge a percentage of sales, while others charge by the number of orders processed. Some incorporate sophisticated analytics and purchase order management tools, while others incorporate some listing functionality, repricers, accounting software integration and shipping rate optimization tools. Also, not all marketplaces can be handled by each inventory and order management tool today. Careful due diligence on such centrally critical software is necessary for the individual business owner.</p>
<p class="p1">Ask each company:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">What&#8217;s included and what&#8217;s not?</li>
<li class="p1">How much automation of which steps can the software do?</li>
<li class="p1">How much flexibility do you have to roll into or out of the software? How long is the on-boarding process, and what &#8220;house-in-order&#8221; steps are required of you to get started?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="p1">Multichannel Selling Solutions</h2>
<p class="p1">For a seller looking to build and house its listing data in one place, as well as to coordinate inventory across multiple marketplaces, the multichannel sales providers offer a suitable solution.</p>
<h3 class="p2">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">While the combined use of a listing solution and an inventory and order management solution may be appropriate for some sellers, other sellers solve the listing-inventory-order issue using a single solution. For sellers using this second option, the companies below offer support to multi-channel sellers, getting their listings and inventory organized and pushed out to various sales channels.</p>

<p class="p1">Do you pride yourself on moving into bigger warehouses every couple of years, all because your business keeps growing? Are you spending more and more of your time managing your warehouse (staff, equipment, operations), rather than building your business? You probably didn&#8217;t become an entrepreneur to become an expert on the intricacies of managing a warehouse.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">While competitively-priced 3PLs can be more expensive than the out-of-pocket costs of running your own warehouse, your most precious asset is your time to spend on building your business. Be prepared to spend a little more on warehousing through a 3PL in order to free yourself up from all of the headaches a warehouse often brings a small business owner.</p>
<p class="p1">Not all 3PLs are equally experienced at FBA prep, poly bagging, bundling and kitting. Do your research carefully, and talk with case study clients that the 3PL provides. Also, expect some transition period up front as you train the 3PL employees on exactly the process you want for your order processing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Amazon Account Management Consultants &amp; Services</h2>
<p class="p1">Selling on Amazon is difficult, even for the largest, more experienced sellers on Amazon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To stay on top of best practices and make sure that those longer-term &#8220;back burner&#8221; projects get properly addressed, it is sometimes necessary to bring in an account management consultant. These consultants can provide short-term or medium-term support. Given that an account management consultant is working typically with multiple sellers, this person will have seen a lot of behaviors – good and bad – that can be used as benchmarks to give you a richer perspective of where you can improve. The consultant is also likely to provide a valuable perspective, removed from your heavily invested day-to-day view of everything you are doing to run your business today.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">With no certification needed to become an Amazon consultant, anyone could declare him or herself as such, resulting in a wide range of skills and capabilities. It is critical for sellers to do due diligence and authenticate the quality and expertise of a consultant. Every seller should start with the assumption that there are no silver bullets to being a successful seller on Amazon. It takes operational discipline and relevant data to do this well, so look for consultants who can help with operations and data.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Cross-Border Currency Management</h2>
<p class="p1">If you are selling product on an international Amazon marketplace, you are paying Amazon upward of 3.5%-4.0% transaction fee to handle currency exchange and wiring of your funds back to the U.S. That sort of hidden fee is size-able on otherwise low-margin products. Fortunately, these solution providers streamline the process for you. With them, you can cut that cost in half and recapture margin you didn&#8217;t realize you were losing.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">These solution providers can streamline the process because they set up foreign bank accounts for you. Those bank accounts require a bunch of paperwork. Prepare to invest several hours reviewing legal paperwork to get set up in each foreign country. Once you are setup, you are good to go.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Automate Messaging</h2>
<p class="p1">Unless you plan on signing into your Seller Central account every 24 hours of every day of the year, you leave yourself exposed to the possibility that a new inquiry from a customer goes unanswered within the required 24 hour period. These solution providers help to meet Amazon&#8217;s requirement of a 24-hour timeframe for responding to Amazon customers, while letting you enjoy your weekend or brief holiday.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Many of these automated messaging services send customers a generic response. You should still plan to provide the customer a more expansive response within a couple of business days, as customers want their questions properly answered before buying your product or filing negative feedback.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Customer Email Support</h2>
<p class="p1">What happens when you are starting getting dozens of customer emails a day, asking the same types of questions over and over? Each email must be answered quickly and accurately so as to keep the customer happy. If you&#8217;re looking to streamline the process of answering these emails, good customer email support software will help to semi-automate your responses. The same way that Amazon&#8217;s Seller Support has created standard responses for certain commonly asked questions, these software programs can help you streamline answers to your most common customer inquiries.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Most multi-channel sellers find that the level of customer emails they get from Amazon customers is far lower than other marketplaces. Often the questions will be related to some sort of shipping-related issue. If a seller is predominantly using FBA for its Amazon catalog, it&#8217;s likely such software won&#8217;t be needed for the Amazon portion of the seller&#8217;s overall business.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) Violation Monitoring</h2>
<p class="p1">This software is usually relevant only for brand owners, rather than resellers, as it is the brand owner that wants to identify MAP-violating resellers. If you are a private label manufacturer or brand owner supplying Amazon resellers with product that is supposed to be sold at MAP levels, these software packages can provide you with accurate, real-time data on which sellers are violating MAP. This allows you to have a data-driven discussion with specific resellers about these issues.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Amazon doesn&#8217;t monitor MAP levels on products for brand owners. It&#8217;s up to the brand owner to do this him or herself, and work with his or her own distribution channels to address these issues.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Virtual Assistants</h2>
<p class="p1">If you are spending far too much time on trainable, repetitive or administrative tasks that someone else could handle, consider getting yourself a virtual assistant for additional support. Maybe it&#8217;s setting up phone calls with your suppliers, answering emails, basic book-keeping or reporting generation work that you need to regularly do, but find you don&#8217;t have enough time to stay on top of such tasks. With the development of a whole industry of skilled, English-speaking assistants, you can free yourself up to work on the highest-value activities.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">No one ever does work as well as you do! Well actually, that may not always be true, but it does take time to get comfortable delegating responsibilities to someone else, especially someone based remotely. With technologies like Skype, instant messaging and phone available, it takes only a little discipline to remain in regular communication with your assistant. You will likely find that your virtual assistant is better organized on the tasks you assign to him/her, as they have fewer tasks.</p>
<p class="p1">If you go down the path of using a virtual assistant, keep in mind that you need to keep these people motivated and feeling valued. Read a book like &#8220;Virtual Freedom&#8221; by Chris Ducker to get yourself up to speed on what it realistically takes to get set up in an effective virtual assistant relationship.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p2">Sponsored Product Ads Tools</h2>
<p class="p3">After recent changes in the product review rules at Amazon, many more sellers are becoming focused on advertising to drive traffic to their products.</p>
<p class="p3">While the Sponsored Product ad offering by Amazon provides sellers with opportunities to increase traffic to their listings, competition for the limited ad space is quickly increasing.</p>
<p class="p3">Sellers need to become much more sophisticated in their bidding strategies and available budgets. Fortunately, new software is available to help sellers make sense of the return on investment of the endless number of keywords that could be used to promote individual products through Sponsored Products.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p3">Customer search behavior changes over time, so it’s ideal to continue using such tools on a regular basis, constantly improving the effectiveness of advertising efforts. Words and terms that are not effective today may become more effective in a few months, as customers are exposed to new product choices.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Landing Pages</h2>
<p class="p1">Common situations you&#8217;d need a landing page for include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">You are building a shopping site using your own domain</li>
<li class="p1">You are creating a temporary flash site</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In both situations, you probably don&#8217;t want to waste a bunch of time figuring out how to get your site operational and looking decent for customers. Fortunately, these providers offer you easy-to-use, inexpensive tools so you can focus on selling, rather than becoming a frustrated web designer.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Speed vs. bell-and-whistles functionality is the major tradeoff. While you may need a more permanent site, the tools of these providers are meant to get you up and running quickly. If you want much more advanced functionality, it will take time and likely the help of a web designer to get the perfect look and feel for your long-term site.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Logo Design</h2>
<p class="p1">If you are building your own website or your own brand, you will likely want to build a logo for these assets. And you most likely aren&#8217;t as artistic as you are entrepreneurial, so look at these solution providers. Some offer a single design, while others use a competitive approach to getting you many options from which to pick your preferred.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Some of these sites allow you to enforce an NDA with your designers, so as not to publicize pre-launch that your website or product is coming. Be sure to give your designers information on what the website or product is meant to do and the audience it is targeted toward.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Social Media &amp; SEO</h2>
<p class="p1">If you have your own site or brand, it can be beneficial to bring in an expert – even for just a few months – to build exposure of your assets quickly, with the careful expertise of someone who does this sort of thing over and over. They can provide bandwidth creating new marketing content that is used to spread the word on your product, or they can manage the distribution of any existing content you already have.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">While no directory could possibly include all of the skilled social media marketing people out there, here are a few to get you started. There are many skilled people in this space, so if you are looking at improving awareness in a local area, ask other companies who might have had direct experience with local providers.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Task Outsourcing</h2>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s face it, you don&#8217;t have enough time to get everything done! There is a whole world of talented freelancers out there that can handle all sorts of projects for you.</p>
<p class="p1">If you&#8217;re running short on time or expertise to complete specific types of tasks, these companies organize freelancers to make it easier for you to find people who will help. Freelancer services range and include: consulting, designing, writing, creating listings, improving marketing materials, building websites or software, handling repetitive data look-up tasks, etc. Chances are some other Amazon sellers have already defined Amazon-seller tasks for these freelancers. It&#8217;s worth exploring what talented help might be out there to support your business today.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Some tasks may involve sharing confidential or semi-confidential information, so be careful about what you choose to outsource. Check to see that your work is being done by the person you&#8217;re talking with on these sites. Sometimes work gets farmed out, and you don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s doing the work. Interview multiple people and give them small test projects to see if you have good communication and work well together on getting expected results back within the expected timeframe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="p1">Return Management &amp; Reverse Logistics Services</h2>
<p class="p1">As the number of orders increases, so too will your number of returns. Those returns can be rather annoying to manage and often include the inspection, grading and testing, upgrading, repackaging, etc.</p>
<p class="p1">Given that customers rarely send back all of the product, warranty, instruction manual and packaging, there is likely to be additional work needed to attempt to convert a returned item to a re-sellable item (hopefully in &#8220;new&#8221; form again).</p>
<p class="p1">If you have more than one full-time employee working just on returns, it&#8217;s time to be asking questions to these solution providers to see if they can streamline this headache for you.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Returns can cost you money in return fees and repackaging, but they also cost a disproportionate amount of time to repair versus selling a unit newly sourced from your supplier. There is a size-able opportunity cost to managing returns, both in terms of time, and potentially the lack of expertise on how to maximize recovery rates on those returns. These solution providers know the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s on how to make the returns process less painful and costly for you.</p>

<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">While Amazon is not known for providing sales and revenue data that can be easily incorporated into accounting software, some of the companies below have developed API and conversion tools to absorb existing Amazon data into their tools.

<h2 class="p1">Accounting and Bookkeeping Support</h2>

This way,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>you can maintain a macro view of your financial position at any given moment, rather than waiting until year-end when taxes are due.</p>
<p class="p1">Face it; almost no one likes recording all of their financial data, but it&#8217;s necessary to know where you are doing well and where improvements are immediately needed. Rather than put unnecessary lags between paperwork coming in and you understanding how that paperwork reflects your true financial position, these solution providers offer you the ability to keep an eye on your financials without having to deal with the laborious task of sporadic, manual data entry.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">These companies can offer basic book-keeping, or full-scale accounting (including income tax preparation and inventory reconciliation support). Depending on how complex your inventory and channels are, you may want to outsource more and more of this to focus on your skills sourcing profitable product.</p>

<p class="p1">In which states do you owe sales tax? Are you collecting enough sales tax in enough states?</p>
<p class="p1">If you can&#8217;t answer these questions today, it&#8217;s time to look for support. And if you can answer these questions, and you&#8217;re required to pay in more than 2-3 states each quarter, you probably could benefit from the streamlined processes these companies will be able to provide you. No more manually filing papers to each required state. These companies will streamline all of that for you, and keep on top of ever-changing tax rules for each tax jurisdiction (state, county, city, etc.) in which you have tax nexus.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Whether you collect state tax or not on your online sales, you almost certainly are liable for paying the state taxes. Work with your tax attorney to confirm where you owe state taxes, and then consider using Amazon&#8217;s tax collection services to streamline the collection process, while using any of these solution providers to support the tax remittance process.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Profitability Analysis</h2>
<p class="p1">If you understand your all-in-costs by SKU, you can figure out your profitability by SKU, which will guide your actions on inventory management, vendor negotiations, sourcing of new products and pricing. If you keep your total sales revenue and total gross margin each aggregated, then you have no visibility on specific product issues or opportunities which ultimately drive your overall profitability. Most sellers realize they need more granular profitability analysis when they experience YOY sales growth that is not matched by at least the same growth in YOY gross margins.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p3">Rarely do all products in a seller’s catalog generate positive margins, once consideration for indirect and overhead costs are made. Only at the point that all costs have been allocated down to the individual SKU level can a seller take immediate necessary action to course-correct on product selection.</p>
<p class="p1">Please note that many of the inventory and order management tools have incorporated profitability analysis tools into their overall structure. These companies below are stand-alone applications.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Cash Management Tools / Financing Options</h2>
<p class="p1">Most entrepreneurs think they need more capital. Depending on how well organized your accounting books are, there are plenty of organizations that will lend various amounts of money to build up your businesses.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Being an Amazon seller can be risky if you’re not paying attention to the road all the time. Bringing lenders into the equation adds more risk – risk that can be well managed if you are properly managing your overall business.</p>
<p class="p1">If you don’t know what you are doing as an Amazon seller, it’s probably best not to get too involved in using some else’s money.</p>
<p class="p1">As an FBA seller, you won’t be able to grant “first lien” rights to most lenders, as Amazon doesn’t allow anyone into their fulfillment centers to take control of inventory used as collateral in a loan. So be prepared to get very little funding based purely on the value of FBA inventory – other assets are required typically.</p>

<p class="p1">Even the best product photographer&#8217;s photos may need some cropping, whitening or general adjustment to get the image in line with Amazon requirements.</p>
<p class="p1">This cleanup can take a lot of time when considering the addition of dozens or hundreds of new listings. This is not an ideal way for you to invest your time in your business. Fortunately, these low-cost, quick-turnaround options are available, allowing you to take moderately professional photos and get them cleaned up for primetime on Amazon.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Only so much cleanup can be done on a bad photo. It&#8217;s ideal to get some feedback on a test run of photos you take to make sure you have provided these companies with an adequate quality of photo before modification.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Amazon SEO: Keyword Research</h2>
<p class="p1">Whether you are looking to optimize new listings or existing listings onto which you have added your product offers, it&#8217;s important to understand what keywords Amazon customers are using to find your product. Otherwise, you may have a fantastic product that never gets discovered by Amazon customers or loses out on suitable keyword traffic.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Customer preferences can change over time, meaning that your keyword selections today may need to be updated later. Consider refreshing your primary listings at least annually. Also, remember that customers may be finding your products through keywords that aren&#8217;t obvious to you today. There is a significant benefit in referencing the large historical databases that these providers have built to match keywords with products.</p>

<h2 class="p1">UPC Barcodes – Purchase</h2>
<p class="p1">If you are building a private label business on Amazon, you&#8217;re going to need UPCs (Universal Product Codes) for each product you list. We also want to mention that you should not be buying UPCs to put onto other companies&#8217; existing products. We have seen too many new listings get created that are duplicates of existing listings, but the new seller didn&#8217;t do the necessary work of matching its offers to the existing listings in the Amazon catalog.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Never recycle UPCs onto other products. Once a UPC has entered Amazon&#8217;s catalog, it is tied to a specific item. If you decide to stop carrying one private label product, don&#8217;t use that UPC for some new item. You will create a mess for yourself that can result in hundreds of canceled or returned orders and far too much negative feedback.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Amazon Data Management &amp; Feed Integration</h2>
<p class="p1">As you increase the number of new listings in your catalog or you consider adding new marketplaces (beyond Amazon) to your overall business, it will quickly get very complicated to keep track of all the columns of data needed for your listings (whether on Amazon or other marketplaces). By working with a company that specializes in keeping up with what columns of data are needed in each category of each marketplace, you can save yourself a lot of time building and maintaining your product feeds.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Some inventory and order management solution providers indicate that they offer listings functionality in their tools. But first, you need to be sure your product categories on your desired marketplaces are all covered by your inventory/order management solution provider. Some companies pick an apparent &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; inventory/order management partner only to discover not all listing templates needed are available. This requires the seller to work with a data feed provider anyway.</p>
<p class="p1">It is also worth mentioning that if your business is all-Amazon, and focused exclusively on adding offers to existing listings that someone has created, your need for a data feed provider is going to be low, as you aren&#8217;t likely contributing new data or editing existing data on your listings.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Get Amazon Product Reviews</h2>
<p class="p1">If you sell private label product, you should be immediately looking for ways to get legitimate product reviews on your items from the get-go. The presence of a minimum 5-10 product reviews per private label product helps to reduce a customer&#8217;s hesitancy to purchase, as the customer can read what others have written about your product. Furthermore, listings with product reviews are much more likely to get better search results on Amazon than products with no sales history.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">There are unfortunately a few sites that offer illegitimate product reviews where the reviewer has never seen the product, and writes product reviews blindly for cash. After recent crackdowns at Amazon on such reviews, there are much more strict rules about how product reviews need to be sourced, and Amazon is now watching more carefully than ever before to make sure reviews are legitimate.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Verified purchase&#8221; reviews are much more valuable than reviews that haven&#8217;t come from &#8220;verified&#8221; purchases, raising the importance of not only getting product reviews on new listings, but also getting some initial sales on those items which will then lead to &#8220;verified&#8221; product reviews. Most of the solution providers mentioned here will help you get sales on your new products, coupled with verified purchase product reviews. This is a powerful duo for new product launches.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Get Amazon Feedback</h2>
<p class="p1">Feedback is one of the critical measures used by Amazon to evaluate sellers, while also providing prospective customers with guidance on how efficiently you have historically provided high-quality product on time to other Amazon customers. From the first Amazon sale you make, Amazon tracks how you are doing both in terms of average feedback as well as overall feedback count. Your feedback score will be used in evaluating if you qualify for the Buy Box.</p>
<p class="p1">Ideally you should aim for an average feedback score above 98%, while below 90% is likely to result in a loss of your Buy Box privileges. In fact, for brand new sellers (not using FBA), it is common for you to have to wait at least a month building up the number of feedback before Amazon will allow you to become &#8220;Buy Box eligible.&#8221; Feedback matters from day one on Amazon, and you need to collect feedback from your customers.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Many sellers choose to manually solicit customers directly for feedback through Seller Support. While that is allowed according to Amazon’s Terms of Service, the process can get rather unscalable as your business grows. Fortunately, there are software providers that can make this feedback request process an automated process, complete with easy-to-use templates.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Re-Pricing Tools &amp; Services</h2>
<p class="p1">If you are competing head-to-head with other sellers on your listings, it&#8217;s likely you are fighting it out over price. As other sellers reduce prices, your product becomes less interesting and less visible to customers as a result of losing the Buy Box. That is, unless you can reduce your price too, ensuring your ability to remain competitive for the Amazon Buy Box. As you know, products that appear in the Amazon Buy Box sell 4x more than those that don&#8217;t ever make it in, and an estimated 90% of new product sales come from products in the Buy Box.</p>
<h3 class="p3">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">When you sign up for a re-pricing tool, you will need to identify your floor price for each item. To do that effectively, it is best to have a strong grasp of your all-in costs by SKU (including indirect and overhead costs). That way, you aren&#8217;t inadvertently setting a floor price that is underwater for you, all in the name of getting the sale at all cost. Let&#8217;s focus on remaining profitable.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, keep in mind that pricing alone does not determine if you will win the Buy Box. Without strong performance metrics across the board (related to customer service, late shipment rate, cancellation rate, negative feedback, etc.), your ability to match your competitor on price and get your fair share of the Buy Box will be hampered significantly. Next, remember that not all of your competitors are equal, even if their prices are equal. Keep an eye out for Amazon Retail offers and FBA seller offers. With those in place, it will be harder to use a re-pricer to match price alone and get your fair share of the Buy Box.</p>
<p class="p1">The list below includes standalone re-pricing tools. It&#8217;s worth noting that many of the inventory management and order management solution providers offer integrated re-pricing tools as part of their software.</p>

<h2 class="p1">Split Testing Tools</h2>
<p class="p1">For the more sophisticated seller, a new tool has recently become available to help sellers test out different versions of product images, content and pricing.</p>
<p class="p1">This tool is useful specifically for the seller that controls the listing content of specific products. In such situations, it makes a lot of sense to see how customers respond to different content.</p>
<p class="p1">We like the experimental, scientific nature of such a tool, and encourage you trial out a variety of these tools. We hope to see many more tools available to help sellers to test and refine what they are doing, just as Amazon does itself today with thousands of daily tests on its website.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Key Issues to Consider</h3>
<p class="p1">Sellers should be open-minded that customers may surprisingly respond to content that isn’t the Sellers’ own favorite content. So it’s up to sellers using this software to test a wide range to evaluate relative effectiveness of such content.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, testing should not be done along a “1 and done” approach, but rather regular testing and improving on listings (much like how Amazon constantly evolves through its nonstop testing efforts).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[So you&#8217;re up and running as an Amazon seller, and you think you&#8217;ve figured out the Amazon marketplace. The good&#8230;]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">So <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/what-to-know-before-selling-on-amazon/">you&#8217;re up and running as an Amazon seller</a>, and you think you&#8217;ve figured out the Amazon marketplace. The good news is, if you&#8217;ve made it out alive (and profitably) through your first holiday shopping season, you&#8217;re doing well.</p>
<p class="p1">But, there are a number of issues that even large or long-term Amazon sellers don&#8217;t figure out.</p>
<p class="p1">I&#8217;m pleased to unveil the pitfalls to you now –– but like a child who thinks she&#8217;s figured out how a magician does a trick, you still will need to work hard to avoid the common problems many sellers encounter when they start selling on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1">Knowing these will at least set you up to be more aware of where those pitfalls might be hiding. Use the infographic to help visualize the issues and read through exactly how to solve them in the article below.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-pitfalls-infographic.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-17458" src="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-pitfalls-infographic.jpg" alt="selling-on-amazon-pitfalls-infographic" width="750" height="4712" srcset="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-pitfalls-infographic.jpg 1000w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-pitfalls-infographic-300x1885.jpg 300w, https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/selling-on-amazon-pitfalls-infographic-750x4712.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="p3">Tax Setup</h2>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s a little shocking how many sellers never set up state tax collection options on Amazon, thinking that Amazon somehow automatically takes care of all sales tax issues from sales on the Amazon marketplace.</p>
<p class="p1">It turns out nothing could be further from the truth. While Amazon is happy to collect state sales tax for you (for a small fee), it&#8217;s up to every seller to indicate in which states it wants Amazon to collect tax, and to manage the remittance of the taxes to the appropriate tax jurisdictions across the country.</p>
<p class="p1">There are many tax remittance services available for online sellers (such as taxjar.com, avalara.com, taxify.com, and vertexsmb.com), but the seller ultimately has the responsibility of paying its taxes. While a seller may choose not to collect state sales tax (choosing to absorb that as a cost of doing business), the responsibility of remitting the tax is not optional.</p>
<p class="p1">A seller can designate its account to collect state sales tax in particular states. Unfortunately, however, Amazon’s default when setting up new listings is to designate each SKU as having a no-tax label, which can overwrite the seller’s general request to collect state sales tax across all of its catalog.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Set your taxes up right the first go around</h3>
<p class="p1">My advice is to, immediately upon signing up a new seller account, go into the Settings –&gt; Tax Settings, and designate not only in which states you want Amazon to collect state sales tax, but also set the “Use default Product Tax Code” setting to “A_GEN_TAX.”</p>
<p class="p1">While the seller may offer products that warrant a slightly different tax rate, that level of tweaking can follow later.</p>
<p class="p1">If the seller is using Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) and isn&#8217;t proactively collecting state sales tax in all of the tax-collecting states where Amazon has fulfillment centers, it won&#8217;t be long before the seller  accumulates tax liability from having incurred tax nexus by way of FBA inventory being stored – even briefly – in these states&#8217; fulfillment warehouses.</p>
<p class="p1">Each FBA seller should invest in a tax consultation with an online seller tax consultant to understand the responsibilities and potential liabilities of using FBA.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Profitability</h2>
<p class="p1">Too many sellers focus on top line sales numbers rather than bottom line profits.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>&#8220;I want to sell $1MM/year on Amazon&#8221; or &#8220;If only I could get to be a $10MM/year seller on Amazon.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="p1">Honestly, other than ego and maybe a few volume discounts, there isn&#8217;t much long-term benefit to being a big, but not particularly profitable seller on Amazon.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Focus on bottom growth and account for all costs upfront</h3>
<p class="p1">I’d much rather see any seller grow its bottom line profits year-over-year much faster than its top line sales. That typically requires a SKU-level understanding of profitability, incorporating overhead and indirect costs into each SKU&#8217;s profit calculation. This includes certain less than obvious Amazon fees, and product write-downs/write-offs.</p>
<p class="p1">While <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seller-fees-costs-analytics/">I&#8217;ll discuss this matter much more in a subsequent chapter</a>, it&#8217;s important to focus on those parts of your catalog <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/how-to-make-money-on-amazon/">that make you money</a> and shed those parts that don&#8217;t make you money.</p>
<p class="p1">Stop averaging everything out, and looking only at your overall sales numbers and margins. Start thinking about every SKU you sell on Amazon as having its own P&amp;L, its own market forces, and its own level and types of competitions. Such an approach has helped many a seller rationalize its catalog, focusing on bottom line growth ahead of all other financial goals.</p>
<h2 class="p3">Fulfillment by Amazon</h2>
<h3 class="p4">The Issue with Co-Mingled SKUs</h3>
<p class="p1">There are a number of problems here, and I&#8217;ll start with the use of co-mingled &#8220;stickerless&#8221; SKUs.</p>
<p class="p1">As mentioned in a previous chapter, a seller has the option of <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-fba-repricing-strategy/">sending product into FBA</a> without having to provide SKU-level stickers on each unit. Such stickerless inventory has the potential to get mixed in with the inventory of other FBA sellers of the same SKU. Then when a customer places an order from one FBA seller, Amazon pulls the most convenient inventory, even if that inventory isn&#8217;t actually the inventory that the seller sent into FBA itself.</p>
<p class="p1">And, if other sellers have sent in counterfeit product or used condition product that they are trying to pawn off as new condition product, now the seller with this new sale may get itself into trouble with Amazon for selling problematic product to a customer. Amazon responds when customers complain about product quality –– and the heavy lifting falls on the individual sale-level brand.</p>
<p class="p1">At roughly $0.20/unit for Amazon to sticker items or whatever a seller’s own warehouse costs are, we see the costs of stickering FBA units as far lower than the implied cost of having one’s seller account suspended for apparently selling counterfeit co-mingled product to a customer.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Stickerless v. Stickered Inventory</h3>
<p class="p1">The other complicated issue around stickerless vs. stickered FBA inventory is when a seller designates its account to be stickered. By default, each new FBA account starts off as stickerless. When a seller creates a shipment of product to send to Amazon’s fulfillment centers, that stickerless designation will be applied to the seller’s SKUs and will remain forever going forward with that SKU. So, if the seller wants it&#8217;s FBA product to be stickered, the seller has to change the default setting before creating its first shipment to FBA. Otherwise, the seller will have to create a duplicate stickered offer on the same product listing.</p>
<p class="p1">We’ve seen many sellers not get this sequencing right, leading to situations where they think they changed their account to stickered, only to discover that certain SKUs remain stickerless because they were initially sent to FBA before the whole account got switched over to stickered. So if in doubt, flip everything to stickered (not co-mingled) immediately upon turning on FBA (but before creating the first FBA shipment), or contact Amazon Seller Support to get clarification if any SKUs in your catalog are unknowingly stickerless.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Repackage Unsellable Customer Returns</h3>
<p class="p1">Next, Amazon defaults every FBA seller&#8217;s account to enabled for &#8220;Repackage Unsellable Customer Returns.&#8221; This means when a customer returns an FBA order, if that product&#8217;s packaging is damaged, Amazon may apply its own packaging to make the unit resellable. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not unusual for customers to see this Amazon repackaging as potentially an identifier of counterfeit or used product, resulting in a customer complaint or even an infringement against the seller for selling used condition product as new condition product.</p>
<p class="p1">Unless you sell your product in a generic polybag or generic cardboard box (with no logos on the packaging), I suggest turning off this repackaging feature immediately, and handling all repackaging yourself to ensure only the highest quality product (with proper packaging) is presented to Amazon customers.</p>

<p class="p1">
<h2 class="p3">Listing Optimization</h2>
<p class="p1">There are a number of sources of data available within Seller Central that can be used to improve the listing quality of your catalog. For many sellers, the process of building and optimizing listings is a one-time deal, as they understandably turn their focus to other operational matters.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Use the Sponsored Product Ad campaign reports</h3>
<p class="p1">A significant opportunity, however, lies in using the reports from the Sponsored Product ad campaigns. In these reports, you can see the exact keywords that were connected to Amazon customers buying your products. By examining these reports periodically (specifically for automatic targeting campaigns), you&#8217;ll find that there are keywords leading to sales that you never anticipated being effective.</p>
<p class="p1">Lifting those terms directly into your generic keywords will improve the SEO discoverability of your listings. I encourage sellers to repeat this process every three months to make sure that customers’ behavior specific to certain words haven’t changed. And with the generic keyword capacity for words now much larger than ever before, there is room to add many more keywords and get click benefit through SEO rather than paid efforts.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Include answers to previous product inquiries on your product page</h3>
<p class="p1">It’s also worth paying special attention the inquiries that you get from Amazon customers. If customers are asking product specific questions, newly addressing these issues in your product detail page content is likely to improve customer conversation over time.</p>
<p class="p1">For too many Amazon sellers, the customer inquiry process doesn’t include an indexing of questions and answers back to specific SKUs, thereby causing a seller to lose out on known product clarifications or embellishments that are needed.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Ask for the category listing report</h3>
<p class="p1">Finally, I&#8217;m a big fan of the &#8220;Category Listing Report,&#8221; a report available in the Inventory Reports section, but only when requested through Seller Support. This report will recreate your product listings&#8217; flat file, making it much easier for you to identify any data gaps in your listings (including missing bullet points, generic keywords, improper tax codes, etc.).</p>
<p class="p1">While you request this report for only a finite period (i.e., seven days, 30 days), it&#8217;s worth pulling this report at least quarterly to make sure your product listings contain all of the necessary data you believe they should.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Read our chapter on <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seo-strategy/">optimizing Amazon Search</a> to get more tips on boosting your product rankings.</em></span><em> </em></p>
<h2 class="p3">Operations</h2>
<p class="p1">And now the biggest category of all. Managing the operations of an Amazon seller business is the most time-consuming part of every seller’s day. Too many sellers don’t focus on the right activities, leading them to work too hard to make Amazon money.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Let’s Start with Returns</h3>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Do you have a clear process for handling returns efficiently?</strong></em></span></p>
<p class="p1">Do you have a way of testing or grading returns, upgrading packaging where needed, and recovering as much revenue as possible by making these items sellable again on Amazon (or some other channel, as needed)?</p>
<p class="p1">For too many sellers, handling returns is something done at the end of the month when they have time, rather than something that is managed strategically through analytics and continuous improvement.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Yes, returned products aren&#8217;t likely to be 100% recoverable as new condition products.</em></p>
<p class="p1">However, if you carefully track the return rate of each SKU, the recovery rate of each SKU (i.e., what proportion of expected new condition revenue you actually recover from each SKU), and which products are most likely to be returned damaged by customers, you can identify which products you need to remove from your active catalog. You&#8217;ll also identify with which products and brands you may need to negotiate a returns allowance with your suppliers/distributors/brands.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you have this data in hand, you’ll likely be surprised to discover just how much financial loss you incur because of high return rates and high write-down/write-off costs.</p>
<p class="p1">Some of the best sellers on Amazon know, for each SKU, exactly where to sell returned products to get the highest recovery rate. It&#8217;s worth talking with other sellers to figure out if you are unknowingly leaving a lot of money on the table by mishandling returned products, or if you are appropriately managing returned products as a core part of your overall seller business.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Look Out for Duplicate Listings from Competitors</h3>
<p class="p1">Duplicate listings on Amazon can be an effective way for competitors to divert traffic away from your product listings back to theirs. It’s worth, at least once a quarter, to search the whole Amazon catalog for duplicate listings of your items.</p>
<p class="p1">If you find other listings of the same products, consider filing tickets with Seller Support to get duplicate listings merged. And, if the duplicate listings were created maliciously by sellers using incorrect data (e.g., irrelevant UPCs or incorrect brand names), it may be worth also filing tickets reporting violations against those sellers. I have seen far too many sellers confused about why their sales are dropping on top-selling items, only to find that the sales are being diverted to a duplicate listing newly created by a coy competitor.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Inventory Management Skills are Required</h3>
<p class="p1">Inventory management skills require constant refinement on Amazon, whether it&#8217;s actively addressing soon-to-be stale inventory or rebalancing products based on changing customer preferences.</p>
<p class="p1">While I see most sellers ramping up inventory levels for the holiday shopping season, few sellers stock up enough products to cover most of January as well. Often this leads to unnecessary stock-outs caused by higher than expected demand in December or inadequate time to replenish in early January when your suppliers are closed for the holidays.</p>
<p class="p1">Either way, I like to see sellers planning their holiday shopping inventory levels in such a way that they potentially overstock a little bit for January and February, thereby giving themselves a little bit of breathing room in December, January, and February. Such an approach is especially relevant for products that are expected to continue to have some meaningful sales after December.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Test Your Competitors</h2>
<p class="p1">Test-buying your competitors&#8217; products on Amazon is a very easy way to figure out what your competitors are up to, regarding how they package product, how they follow up through email to customers, and how they handle customer returns (if needed).</p>
<p class="p1">While you and your competitors may be selling the same products, there are likely some aspects of your competitors&#8217; overall offering that you can learn through periodic test buys.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Plan for Pricing and Procurement</h3>
<p class="p1">Finally, with so many <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-pricing-strategy/">changes to competitors and prices on Amazon</a>, I have watched too many sellers be slow to plan how to evolve their catalogs over the next three to six months. Sellers should, at least once a month, focus a few days on the procurement of new selection, as some portion of their existing catalog will likely become unprofitable or below an acceptable margin threshold, leading to a need for better use of capital on other product selection.</p>
<p class="p1">This is particularly the case for resellers that don&#8217;t have exclusive sourcing relationships. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before some competitor with a lower margin threshold starts selling the same product, and makes your offers unsellable.</p>
<p class="p1">While a brand may think it has decent control of its distribution, Amazon is a very efficient marketplace for gray-market or diverted product to surface, leading you to find that you have to cut your prices just to match some new entrant.</p>
<p class="p1">For private label sellers on Amazon, remember that that your product sales successes on Amazon are an invitation for the next private label seller to copy your product and make a lower priced version; so keep evolving and stay nimble. The active catalog you have today isn’t likely to be as profitable or relevant in 6 to 12 months from now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The moment you sign up for an Amazon seller account, the clock starts. With your first monthly account charge coming through after 30 days, you are expected to meet all Amazon performance metrics from day one.</p>
<p class="p1">Before you jump in headfirst and <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-selling-strategies/">start selling on Amazon</a>, there are several steps we encourage any prospective seller to take before formalizing the seller account registration process.</p>
<h2 class="p3">The Necessary Paperwork — an Amazon Checklist</h2>
<p class="p1">To get through the full registration process for an Amazon seller account, you will need a bunch of information readily available, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Business Information</strong>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your legal business name, address, and contact information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Email Address</strong>
<ul>
<li class="p1">An email address that can be used for this company account. This email account should be set up already, as you will start receiving important emails from Amazon almost immediately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Credit Card</strong>
<ul>
<li class="p1">An internationally-chargeable credit card with a valid billing address. If the credit card number isn’t valid, Amazon will cancel your registration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Phone Number</strong>
<ul>
<li class="p1">A phone number where you can be reached during this registration process. Also, have your phone nearby during registration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Tax ID</strong>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Your tax identity information, including your Social Security number or your company’s Federal Tax ID number. To submit your tax identity information, the registration process will take a brief detour to a “1099-K Tax Document Interview.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>State Tax ID</strong>
<ul>
<li class="p1">State tax ID information for states in which you have tax nexus. This physical presence is typically impacted by company offices, warehouses/3PLs, and call centers. <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-fba-repricing-strategy/">If you plan to use Amazon&#8217;s Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program</a>, there may be further tax nexus implications. I encourage you to talk with a tax attorney or tax accountant who specializes in online seller tax nexus issues (e.g., catchingclouds.net, peisnerjohnson.com) or one of the tax remittance companies that can give you the most current Amazon tax nexus information (e.g., taxjar.com, avalara.com, taxify.co, vertexsmb.com).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="p3">Questions to Work Through Before Registering Your Seller Account</h2>
<p class="p1">Some of the logistics of being a successful seller should be worked out before you set up the seller account, as you likely won’t have as much time to address these after you get started.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__callout post-detail__callout--left"><h3>Download the checklist</h3></p>
<p class="p1">Want to print out this chapter as a worksheet to make sure you don&#8217;t forget anything? <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BCA-PDF.pdf">Download it for free here</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"></div><div class="post-detail__body-inner"></p>
<h3 class="p1">Where do you plan to send order returns?</h3>
<p class="p2">Are you going to handle the returns yourself, or send them to a company that specializes in testing/grading returns and making the product available for sale again (e.g., tradeport.com, openedboxreturns.com)</p>
<p class="p2">Who on your team will handle Amazon customer inquiries? The key is not just having all of the answers, but also respecting Amazon’s requirements to respond to all customer inquiries within 24 hours, any day of the year. Hence, figuring out who is on point (with possible backup) is one critical operational issue that should be addressed before opening your Amazon seller account.</p>
<h3 class="p1">If you plan to use Amazon’s Fulfillment by Amazon program, will you co-mingle your products?</h3>
<p class="p2">I very much recommend using FBA, given its visibility potential to 50MM+ Amazon Prime customers. If you decide to go that route, you’ll need to decide whether you plan to co-mingle your products with FBA inventory of other sellers of the same products.</p>
<p class="p2">Amazon gives FBA sellers this potentially lethal option of sending product into Amazon&#8217;s Fulfillment Centers, where they might get co-mingled with other FBA sellers&#8217; product, leading to your products possibly getting mixed up with counterfeit or low-grade versions of what you purport to be selling.</p>
<p class="p2">Unfortunately, if a co-mingled unit gets picked to fulfill an order on your account, you are left explaining to Amazon why a customer complained about getting a counterfeit item. You need to work through this issue very early on because if you decide to use FBA but not use the co-mingled (“stickerless”) option, you need to activate your account to become a “stickered” FBA account right at the beginning before you create your first FBA shipment into Amazon.</p>
<p class="p2">While it is possible later on to become a stickered account, it quickly becomes very complicated if you have already sent some product into FBA as stickerless product.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Do you plan to use a DBA (doing business as) name to operate your Amazon seller account?</h3>
<p class="p2">While some companies have legitimate reasons to use a different customer-facing name, Amazon is also a place where many sellers purposefully conceal their identity. Reasons for doing this include not wanting brands to know that they are selling online, or the brand is actually the reseller and doesn&#8217;t want its other retail partners to know it&#8217;s selling product online direct to consumer.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Have you checked to see if the products you plan to list are in categories that Amazon has gated?</h3>
<p class="p2">Amazon has restrictions on who can sell in certain categories, and while the ungating process is usually surmountable, it’s important to recognize that if your desired categories are gated, you will have to apply very quickly to get ungated. Check out Amazon’s approval category page before you decide to register on Amazon, and you can learn more about the ungating process if it applies to your product categories.</p>
<h2 class="p4">Skills You Should Know Now – Or Understand How to Build Quickly</h2>
<p class="p2">The Amazon marketplace has its own setup rules and regulations, but also its own combination of skills that every seller should master fairly quickly to succeed profitably and long-term.</p>
<p class="p2">These include:</p>
<h3 class="p1">Stellar marketing content to build product listings</h3>
<p class="p2">If the products you are selling are already sold by others on Amazon, this is less important because you will most likely end up adding your offer to the product listing that&#8217;s already in place (requiring you to provide only basic pricing, quantity available and SKU name information). But, if your products are new to the Amazon catalog (easy to check by simply searching for your brand or UPC in the Amazon.com search bar), you will need to come up with content for such field as product titles, bullet points, product description, and generic keywords (<a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seo-strategy/">for optimizing SEO on your listings</a>).</p>
<p class="p2">You will also need product images for your listings – check out<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=20020211"> Amazon’s <em>adding images</em> support page</a> for reference, but we encourage sellers to have multiple images, including a lifestyle image, if possible, to show the product in use. This lifestyle image complements the main image that has strict requirements, including a white background, no branding and at least a 500&#215;500 pixel count.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Clear understanding of your product sourcing avenues</h3>
<p class="p2">If your products sell well on Amazon, do you know how to replenish quickly enough to avoid extensive stockout periods? If you specialize in close-outs and one-time buys, you may not be able to replenish the same SKUs easily, but should have strong channels for adding new inventory, as your Amazon cash position improves.</p>
<h3 class="p1">A decision on if you plan to sell the same items over and over</h3>
<p class="p2">If yes, you will want to take advantage of Amazon’s replenishment alert tools inside Seller Central, as well as other external forecasting tools, such as standalone tools from www.forecastly.com or those integrated into many of the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/multi-channel-ecommerce/">multichannel inventory/order management tools</a>.</p>
<h3 class="p1">A developed process for identifying and addressing stale inventory</h3>
<p class="p2">While everyone wants their products to sell, the reality is there will always be some that don&#8217;t sell well and need to be liquidated or sold on other channels to help convert the inventory back into some level of working capital. Amazon has tools to help FBA sellers identify stale inventory, while the non-FBA Amazon seller will need to monitor its inventory by SKU to figure out what might need to be promoted for faster sale.</p>

<h3 class="p1">Understanding of basic cost structure, including overhead costs</h3>
<p class="p2">Far too many sellers on Amazon understand only the basics of SKU-level profitability, resulting in a blended view of the seller&#8217;s overall profitability, rather than a pinpoint perspective on which SKUs drive what percentage of profits, while understanding <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-seller-fees-costs-analytics/">which products are actually costing money to sell on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Too many Amazon sellers don&#8217;t know their profitability until the end of the year when their accountant announces the final numbers, hopefully to the relief of the seller. It&#8217;s critical for sellers to understand and compile all of their overhead costs, and recognize that these expenses need to be integrated in some manner into the running total of costs that a seller incurs selling on Amazon.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Know who is already selling the same SKUs as you on Amazon</h3>
<p class="p2">Shockingly often, new sellers join Amazon, list their products, and only then discover that the level or type of competition on their listings will make it next to impossible for the new seller to make any sales or any margin. Before setting up an Amazon seller account, I strongly encourage every seller to spot check its intended catalog on Amazon to see if Amazon Retail is already selling these items. If so, it&#8217;s best to walk away from those items right now. Also, I encourage sellers to gauge what price points are competitive on Amazon, which can often lead to another recognition that the seller can&#8217;t possibly make any money if it&#8217;s competing with such low-priced competitors.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Know how much time is needed to get listings in place right after registered as an Amazon seller</h3>
<p class="p2">Amazon doesn&#8217;t charge a new seller until the end of the first month on Amazon, during which time, the seller should have created its product offers, and activated at least some with sellable inventory. If you open your account and don&#8217;t list your products, you&#8217;ll still get charged for having your professional seller account open, so why not plan to invest a bunch of time in the first 30 days to get moving on your account?</p>
<p class="p2">Finally, knowing that sales feedback is important to Amazon in gauging the performance of all new sellers, I encourage every new seller to sign up for one of the many inexpensive feedback solicitation tools that send each customer a request for seller feedback. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p2">Feedbackgenius.com</li>
<li class="p2">Feedbackfive.com</li>
<li class="p2">Salesbacker.com</li>
<li class="p2">Bqool.com</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">All of these can all help a seller to get feedback, and show Amazon that the seller is performing well against Amazon&#8217;s performance criteria while keeping customers happy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Amazon marketplace is designed to make it easy for practically anyone to list products on the site, including the brands themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">Add the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-fba-repricing-strategy/">features of the FBA program</a>, and now companies that haven&#8217;t historically fulfilled direct-to-consumer orders can easily handle that operational complexity. Layer in how <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/win-amazon-buy-box/">Amazon&#8217;s Buy Box algorithm</a> prefers lower-priced offers to higher-priced ones and competition across different sellers can quickly become a race to the bottom for margins.</p>
<p class="p1">With far too many sellers not properly incorporating all of their costs into their pricing decisions, I regularly see sellers overestimating how far they can drop their prices and still be profitable.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Brands acting as direct-to-consumer resellers on Amazon are better able to cut retail prices and remain profitable, creating an advantage over resellers.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">So, it becomes harder for a reseller to bring meaningful value to customers if:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">There is no real limit to how many resellers could offer the same products</li>
<li class="p1">Resellers are having to undercut one another to win the Buy Box</li>
<li class="p1">They don&#8217;t often understand their all-in cost structures</li>
<li class="p1">The very brands that make product available to them are now able to compete side-by-side as resellers</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Only those resellers having an exclusive sourcing relationship with its brands, where the brands also agree not to become resellers themselves, have much luck with this route. Even so, as more brands realize the opportunity on Amazon, fewer brands are willing to make such a deal.</p>
<p class="p1">In response to these many changes, we have seen two major shifts in the past 3-4 years occur among the base of resellers on Amazon:</p>
<ol>
<li class="p1">Resellers are aggressively courting brands to become their exclusive resellers on Amazon</li>
<li class="p1">Resellers are developing private label brands of their own so that they can become exclusive resellers of their own brands.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1">With so many <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/amazon-pricing-strategy/">new private label brands surfacing</a>, there is no longer just competition across national brands or between national brands and private label brands, but now also between private label brands operating in the same product spaces.</p>
<p class="p1">So if you&#8217;re about to get started on Amazon as a third-party seller, it&#8217;s critical to understand what sourcing/distribution advantages you will have, as those gains are likely to be short-lived.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s critical for third-party sellers to continuously evaluate their product sourcing advantages and expect that the products making the seller profitable today will need to evolve into a different mix of products within six months.</p>
<h2 class="p3">How Amazon Wins on Amazon</h2>
<p class="p1">There are more than two million third-party sellers operating on the Amazon marketplace.</p>
<p class="p1">And yet, Amazon has all the data, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Which products customers search for</li>
<li class="p1">What they actually buy</li>
<li class="p1">How much they buy at what prices</li>
<li class="p1">Where they can’t find the brands they were searching for</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Although Amazon is a publicly held company, it’s investors have tolerated years of razor-thin margins, which has partly played out by way of Amazon selling products at next to no profit or even at unprofitable levels.</p>
<p class="p1">Amazon would make more profit in the short-term by letting third-party sellers earn the sale. However, the company has taken the approach, in each category of products, of pursuing all of the strategic brands it believes need to be in the catalog to attract Amazon customers to shop first on Amazon over any other site –– online or offline.</p>
<p class="p1">To do this, Amazon has made a number of sourcing agreements with brands to acquire products at prices that don&#8217;t allow Amazon to make any significant profit. This is because the objectives here are for Amazon to bring the right selection at prices consistent with or lower than market prices, available all of the time to Amazon customers. To make these objectives possible, Amazon has chosen selectively to forgo short-term profits in pursuit of long-term customer loyalty.</p>
<p class="p1">For the third-party seller competing head-to-head with Amazon Retail, these differences in objectives often creates situations where Amazon lowers its prices to a point where, rightfully so, the third-party sellers competing against Amazon can’t figure out how Amazon Retail is making any money.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The answer is that Amazon isn&#8217;t making money, at least in the short-term, and it&#8217;s entirely comfortable with that.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">I have also seen third-party sellers frustrated that Amazon doesn’t increase its prices in times of scarcity, such as popular toys being sold right before Christmas. In these situations, while Amazon may put limits on how much product any one customer can buy, it maintains prices at stable levels to help Amazon customers avoid apparent price gouging that can happen otherwise in such situations.</p>
<p class="p1">Let’s just say that Amazon’s runway is a lot longer than any of the other sellers on Amazon.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, for FBA sellers whose products end up competing directly with Amazon Retail, these sellers often get frustrated that they rarely win the &#8220;Buy Box,&#8221; even though their products are also Amazon Prime eligible (by being FBA products) and sold at the same prices as Amazon or even slightly lower.</p>
<p class="p1">Yes, as long as Amazon is in stock on an item, it will almost always win the Buy Box, even if another seller appears to have a better price and equal Amazon Prime designation on its offer. At some point, another seller can lower its prices below a threshold that Amazon Retail has set for itself, but that point is usually well under water for all sellers.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>This information isn’t to scare you away from Amazon. In fact, it’s here to do exactly the opposite.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Knowing <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/blog/what-to-know-before-selling-on-amazon/">how to operate your business within the Amazon ecosystem</a> will better help you to win in this massive global channel. Competing directly with Amazon Retail isn’t necessarily a winning strategy, but there are plenty of other strategies to double down on or modify your approach.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>The rest of this guide will expand on each of those.</em></p>
