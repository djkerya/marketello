		<description><![CDATA[Tracy, I visited each of the websites you recommended but found them to be for relatively inexpensive food items, gift ware, clothing, jewelry, etc.  What about a custom designed dining chair or bar stool costing between $300.00 and $500.00?  Are you aware of any e-commerce company specializing in customized furniture?  Thanks again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Larry, great question! This varies business to business, but by and large the companies I talk to who are doing the best are typically very, very customer centric. So, they will usually take back even custom made items if it didn&#039;t work for the customer. Check out the returns policies of Man Crates, Nine Line, Son of a Sailor and Greg Norman. Those should give you a few options on how to tackle this. Hope that helps!

Thanks! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know this is an older post, but I wanted to contribute something relevant and actionable for what happens AFTER the return policy is created. Product returns are a big problem, and as addressed in #1, don&#039;t hide it. Some online retailers are afraid of even DISCUSSING returns. Wrong way to approach this of course.  

To elaborate on #5, I really love the idea of offering returns for a longer than usual time frame . It can be an interesting tactic to test, almost a game of bluff, that also shows retailer confidence. The mattress is a perfect example. Of course, other types of fashion or &#039;every day items&#039; can work with longer return/exchange policies. Human memory is short these days.

I wrote a long post about using product returns as a value proposition, your Big Commerce readers may find actionable, if you don&#039;t mind my sharing this here:  http://www.ecommercewarriors.net/using-online-retail-return-policies-for-conversion-rate-optimization/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love the article! I have sold Lupine in my pet retail store for over 20 years and their guarantee certainly helps move inventory.
