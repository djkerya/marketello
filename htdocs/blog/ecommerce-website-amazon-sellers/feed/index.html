		<description><![CDATA[As a reseller or Brand owner, i would NOT sell on Amazon. They are to many customers, who say your product is &quot;fake&quot; even if you are get it from the Manufacturer directly! And then they don&#039;t want to return it but wanted a FULL REFUND! And that is just 1 thing what is going on Amazon. (And this problem is JUST on Amazon not on any other platform you see those scams like that) More and more sellers are getting away from Amazon because they are not interested into third party sellers. Just the customers counts.]]></description>
