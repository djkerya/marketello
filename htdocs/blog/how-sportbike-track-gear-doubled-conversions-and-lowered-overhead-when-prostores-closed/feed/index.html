		<description><![CDATA[Hey Karly! Thanks for all the feedback. I do use exit intent popups (did one not popup for you here? ;) We use MailMunch right now on here but I&#039;m happy to hear of any other companies providing them! We&#039;re on WordPress to host this blog –– so anything that connects well with that. In fact, our biggest problem with MailMunch right now is that it doesn&#039;t connect well with HubSpot, so I&#039;m manually having to add in subscribers each week. Not that big of a deal, but it doesn&#039;t get me to that &quot;doing business with less time and less mistakes&quot; ideal. 


Anyway, thanks again for all the info!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tracey, this is a wonderful case study.

Decisions like these made by Biran Van aren’t easy. Most businesses don’t take this very initial step to fight back a challenging situation they are facing. Sportbike Track Gear did a really great job.

“We’re doing business with less people, less time with less mistakes….” This is what exactly every business should aim for. Doubling conversion rate isn’t that easy – I can say it based on my 11 years of internet marketing experience. This was made possible by the “timely decision” of the founder.

I still remember, I used self-created codes for exit intent technology popups a few years back and then I switched to Picreel and it pushed my conversion rate reasonably. You see, it is just about taking the first step, which is not without risks, though.

Tracey, have you ever used exit intent popups? 

Anyway, I’ve learned quite a bit about conversion boost from this story. Thanks again.]]></description>
