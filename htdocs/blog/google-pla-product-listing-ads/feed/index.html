		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tracey,

Thank you heaps. You are a star. 
Unique image would be awesome but my problem is I don&#039;t have those products physically. So I only use what I get from the suppliers. 

All traffic I get is from Google AdWords and I can tell you it&#039;s chewing up my wallet quickly. 

Do you have any advice?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep! Ok -- a quick question (and feel free to email me if that&#039;s easier! tracey.wallace@bigcommerce.com) 

How are you driving traffic?

Both sites look great. I would recommend working on getting unique product images up there ASAP. Product imagery is one of the best investments you can make -- people buy items they can relate with, and having a great quality image is a way to get that across. 

In the meantime, though, how are you driving traffic? Is lack of site traffic your problem, or is it conversion?
