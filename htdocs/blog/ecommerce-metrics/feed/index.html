You need to make sure you are converting as many as possible -- otherwise, the traffic is worthless. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a lot of flux there; ecommerce has a far lower average conversion rate, especially compared to finance. However, check out the Top 10% Conversion Rates. They&#039;re 3 to 5 times higher than the average for each industry, so we can see that the rule holds across the board, regardless of industry.

The flip side, of course, is that if you&#039;re in a high-performer industry like finance, 5% really isn&#039;t a fantastic conversion rate. If you&#039;re comparing yourself to the average across all industries, you&#039;re really deluding yourself into thinking you&#039;re doing better than you are. In truth, the top 10% are doing almost five times better.

Even if the average conversion rates are lower in your industry, the top advertisers are outperforming you by 3-5x or more. http://www.cysppc.com/blog/2016/7/5/lead-gen-puzzle-a-digital-advertising-story-about-catching-it-quickly]]></description>

The great thing about e-commerce is that as customers start coming back, your selling increases and your cost, typically, remains low. This is why its really important to start getting customers to buy more and keep buying i.e. focus on up sell, cross sell and repeat sales.



You are right man.
Some kind of basis of multichannel retailing, you should check this infographic http://www.options-mailorder.co.uk/news.php?id=48]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think we can generalise LTV as a returning customer. Obviously if percentage of returning customer is high, my customer acquisition cost will be then divided among new users, means more customers. My CAC is same or can be more, but my customer base will increase. Now my Already loyal customer will drive my AOV, so should we have something for them also. This is what many E Commerce companies ignore , they acquire a customer but do not care about him anymore, instead focus on acquiring new ones. I guess its all calculation increasing customer base is one thing but Identifying the ones within the base who are driving the growth is important. We may consider it as Digging deep into customer analytics. But offering something to returning customer can drive AOV and LTV to new heights.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ed,

Adding on to what Jessica has said, let me try and simplify what you can measure easily. If you see what LTV is:

LTV = Total Money Customer Spent (CLC) - Cost of Acquiring Customer (CAC)

This looks very similar to:

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price 

This is not a coincidence. Lifetime Value, in a way, is a profit indicator

The great thing about e-commerce is that as customers start coming back, your selling increases and your cost, typically, remains low. This is why its really important to start getting customers to buy more and keep buying i.e. focus on up sell, cross sell and repeat sales.

Apart from the tools Jessica mentioned, NudgeSpot (http://www.nudgespot.com) was built with these metrics as the building block. So, you can use some tool like NudgeSpot to do this. 

If you don&#039;t want to use a tool yet, just focus on the simple profit like equation and make sure you grow it.

Hope that was helpful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great question, Ed! You can get a lot of this information right from the statistics panel within your control panel. In addition, you can integrate with Sumall and Google Analytics (both free) to fill in many of the gaps. 

If you aren&#039;t a data person, all this data can seem overwhelming. The one number you should pay the most attention to is lifetime value (LV). This is the difference between the total money that a customer spends on your store and the cost of acquiring this customer (CAC). The higher the lifetime value, the better: i.e., you want your LTV to keep increasing. The cost of acquiring the customer should take into account all of your marketing efforts. (i.e. Google adwords budget, Facebook ads, etc.)]]></description>
