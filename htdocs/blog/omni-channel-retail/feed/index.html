		<description><![CDATA[Loved the article! It would be interesting to see how people feel about mcommerce as well, what their preferences are, who&#039;s more likely to use an app vs mobile website vs desktop etc. Omni-channel is something a lot of retailers seem to be struggling with at the moment, so I wonder how many are actually meeting customer expectations? I know in the UK mobile shopping is rising massively (http://www.intilery.com/articles/blogs/supporting-omni-channel-shopper) but everything&#039;s really disjointed between platforms!]]></description>
