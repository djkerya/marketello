		<description><![CDATA[Tracey, this is an excellent post. Your content is immediately actionable and the images illustrate the high points clearly - very well done. Nigel Stevens from Big Commerce alerted me to the post, since VM is my field and topic of posts on my blog. My content is geared mostly toward B&#038;M merchandising, but I have just shared a link to your post as I know some of my readers will find your information very useful. I&#039;ll be digging into your blog archives to see more of your great content! ;)]]></description>
