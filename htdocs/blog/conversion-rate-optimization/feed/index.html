		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great article, Kent. 

Getting visitors to your site is one thing, getting them to buy something is another matter entirely. There are numerous variables involved in getting it just right, although tweaking the checkout process caught my eye in particular. 

Sales are usually made impulsively so it is important to push all the right emotional buttons for a conversion. This can often be done just right, right up until the point where they are trying to checkout, only to be faced with complicated forms and processes. This often kills the impulse, and the sale along with it.

We have a solution that enables eCommerce site owners within a network to share information, with the customers&#039; permission, of course. To keep it short, details are passed over automatically meaning that the need for forms is all but eliminated. The customer is taken straight through to the sales page with a single click.

This streamlines the process significantly and contributes to helping ensure more of your visitors turn into paying customers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a really helpful starting point, but the next step up will be looking into the nuts and bolts of an eCommerce strategy - having a strong category strategy for starter. A lot of writers refer to it vaguely by calling it different things (how you group products together, introducing add ons) but it is actually a different thing altogether which every eCommerce website owner should know about and put together. There&#039;s a cool article here about it: https://goo.gl/cqBAvJ - any additional posts around this will be great!]]></description>
